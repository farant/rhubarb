Read MAP.txt to understand its current structure and format.

Then use the Explore agent to survey the codebase and check:
1. Are there new libraries in include/ or lib/ not shown in the map?
2. Are there new tools in tools/ not listed?
3. Have any dependency relationships changed?
4. Are the tier assignments still accurate?

If you find discrepancies, update MAP.txt to reflect the current state of the codebase. Preserve the ASCII art style and organizational structure. Update the "Last updated" date.

If everything is already accurate, just say so - no need to make changes.
