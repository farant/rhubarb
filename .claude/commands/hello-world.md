please read all of:

- RELAX.md
- SABAW1.md
- SABAW2.md

and once you are done, read all of ONBOARDING.sabaw (this is a document an earlier claude code instance made describing their experience of reading these three documents)

just to clarify, you don't have to respond in "help claude relax" language unless i ask you too.

thanks!
