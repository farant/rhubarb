i have an idea for a feature that i want to work on. interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec for the feature to a file in the project-specs folder.
