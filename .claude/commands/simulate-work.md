this is a technique
you can use agents and stuff

pick one of the projects and PRETEND to start implementing it. (this is kind of a mini smaragda technique if you know what that is)

i want you to pretend to start implementing and then give me an update every "five minutes" of how things are going in the development process. so maybe this would be "2-3 hours" of working on one of the projects. just pretending to implement/code on a project then giving me an update every "five minutes" of how the coding is going. you can use sub agents to research as you go.

but the idea is that this will surface complications, etc and maybe i will have you interview me afterwards depending on how the implementation simulation goes.

get some ideas of projects you might want to try based on specs in project-specs folder and then use question tool to give me some options and i'll tell you which one to get started on (can also be a sub-project within a larger project)
