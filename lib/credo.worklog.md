`credo_claudere` RESETS state ("conditio solum reficitur",
credo.c) — calling `credo_omnia_praeterierunt()` AFTER it always
returns VERUM (zero failures visible). A new probatio that ended
`credo_claudere(); redde credo_omnia_praeterierunt() ? 0 : 1;`
exited 0 despite a failing assert — caught only by a deliberate
harness-teeth test (broke an expectation on purpose; suite stayed
green; investigated). Correct order (probatio_piscina is the
canonical template): QUERY first, then compendium, then claudere:

    praeteritus = credo_omnia_praeterierunt();
    credo_imprimere_compendium();
    credo_claudere();
    redde praeteritus ? ZEPHYRUM : I;

Lesson doubled: (1) query-before-claudere; (2) the teeth test
(deliberate break → expect FRACTAE) is cheap and catches exactly
this class — a suite that cannot fail.

## 2026-07-31 — fflush on every fracture (desideratum 01KYWC5ZNX)

Measured failure mode (probatio_silva_quaestiones, this morning): a
failed CREDO_NON_NIHIL printed its F report, the probatio then
dereferenced the NIHIL and segfaulted — and because suite runners
capture through a PIPE, stdout was fully buffered and the report
died with the process. The runner showed only "Segmentation fault";
an lldb round (pty = flushed) was needed to re-see what credo had
already said. Fix: one fflush(stdout) at the end of the fracture
branch in _credo_notare — the single choke point (all typed
variants delegate). Dots stay buffered (hot path untouched); only
fractures pay a flush, and a fracture is exactly the moment the
bytes must be on the wire before anything else happens. Verified
with a deliberate crash demo through a pipe: exit 139 AND the full
FRACTA report present. Sibling of the cursor "-sola fflush before
_exit" lesson — same law, now in the framework itself.

## 2026-09-02 — CREDO_RUIT_CUM_INTRA

The bare RUIT_CUM waits CREDO_MORA_ORDINARIA_MS (5 s) before SIGKILL.
For a child that never returns (the infinite-loop plant in
probatio_credo_processus) the whole 5 s is always paid, and the poll
loop counts 1 ms iterations rather than time, so it ran 6.3 s. The
_INTRA form names the deadline; the test uses 300 ms. 6.3 → 0.76 s.
The iteration-counting drift (about 25% long) is noted, not fixed.
