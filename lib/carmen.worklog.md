## 2026-10-22 - S6b: the song model and the book carmina.stml

Model (sonus-spec VIII-d): song -> tracks (instrument by NAME, gain,
mute, solo) -> clips at tick positions -> notes in ticks relative to the
clip, with pitch, velocity, written letter (spelling) and an optional '@'
preset (percussion). Song maps: tempo (cantus's CantusTempus - one map
type for reader and songs), meter, key (fifths -7..7 + minor, as
MusicXML). Pure data; nothing plays. MML is one way to write a clip; a
future editor edits notes directly.

Reading order matters: initial attributes, then METER changes in document
order (a bar position needs the meter map so far), then tempo and key
changes (full meter map), then tracks. A change at the position of the
previous entry REPLACES it (tempo at bar 1 = the initial tempo).
Meter changes take `mensura` only (they must sit on a bar line); tempo,
key and clips accept `mensura` or `pulsus`, never both.

Rules worth knowing:
- A clip's MML must not contain `t` (tempo belongs to the song). The scan
  skips `@preset` names - `@punctum` contains a 't'.
- Clips of a track must be in position order and must not overlap (a
  score view needs that). Empty clips and rest-only clips are errors.
- Song length = end of the last clip, trailing rests included - the loop
  point for cantor.
- CarminisVitium.frustum is s32 (-1 = no clip): i32 is UNSIGNED here.

Korobeiniki (my transcription of the public-domain folk tune): A minor,
4/4, 144, 16 bars - A section (1-8) and the slow half-note B section
(9-16); quadrans melody + triangulum bass in root/octave eighths. Both
parts checked by script to be exactly 16 bars; the bass bar pattern first
drifted up an octave per bar (4 '>' vs 3 '<') - fixed with a closing '<'.

Suite probatio_carmen: 3 sections (legere, vitia x24, ordinarium); green
on the first implementation run; plants 18/18 red after adding a mute-only
track (a track with BOTH mute and solo hid a mute/solo swap).

## 2026-10-23 - M2a: clips carry their bar marks

CarmenFrustum.lineae / numerus_linearum point at the Cantilena's array
(same piscina - no copy); pulse is inside the clip, offset inside the
clip's text.
