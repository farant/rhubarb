## 2026-09-04 — T1: registry and lexicon; whitespace as tails

Spec §3 sketched a `spatium` genus beside `vocabulum`. Building the
registry I dropped it: a node per space would double the node count
of the corpus (the md corpus has 1.2M tokens) for no query anyone
wants, and it would make "the word and its spacing" two things. The
tree now follows STML's possessor law instead: the whitespace after a
word or punctuation mark, up to the first newline inclusive, is the
element's `cauda`; the remainder of a blank-line run belongs to the
paragraph's `cauda`; leading whitespace to `documentum.praefixa` or
`paragraphus.praefixa`. A sentence has no whitespace slots at all —
its last element carries the space before the next sentence. PUNCTUM
is its own token genus because the period is where abbreviations,
initials and sentence ends are decided; everything else punctuation is
a run of `INTERPUNCTIO`. The vocabulum carries its stage-3 slots from
birth (`analyses`, `classes`, `linguae`) so the registry never has to
be reordered; absent lists are empty under materia's write-once law.
First run green (130 assertions, round trip of "a\n"); the planted
fault (loci_numerus of `sententia` 1 → 2) turns the contiguity check
red.

## 2026-09-04 — T2: one lexer for the whole stream, and the unicode floor's two exceptions

Prose needs no container context, so `oratio_lexare` is a whole-stream
lexer, unlike md's per-line scanners. The corpus gate ran it over every
tracked markdown file on the first green run: 1,134 files, 17.45 MB,
6,696,475 tokens, byte-exact, 0.68 s for the whole suite. Two things
the decision "any UTF-8 sequence is a letter" could not survive contact
with real text: NBSP (C2 A0) is a space, and the General Punctuation
block (U+2000–U+206F: curly quotes, dashes, ellipsis, thin spaces) is
punctuation, with U+2019 an apostrophe between letters. Those are the
only two exceptions, both named in the header; everything else at or
above 0x80 joins a letter run, unvalidated, until the unicode story.
Joiners are decided by the bytes on either side (a hyphen or
apostrophe between letters), a lone period is PUNCTUM, a run of dots
is punctuation, and other punctuation is one token per byte except
runs of the same byte — so the parser sees `"` `)` `.` separately but
`---` and `!!!` whole. The const source pointer goes into the chorda
through the same union md uses (-Wcast-qual). The planted fault
(hyphen emitted as punctuation) went red on `well-known`.
