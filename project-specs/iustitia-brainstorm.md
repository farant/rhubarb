# Iustitia (Justice/Governance) - Raw Interview Brainstorm

Date: 2025-12-31

## Q&A Session

**Q: What feature do you want to build?**
A: Lets do the justice / governance element.

**Q: When you say justice/governance — are you thinking primarily about license revocation/appeals (individual accountability), or broader community governance (who makes rules, how decisions happen), or dispute resolution between parties (commerce conflicts)?**
A: So basically this is about moderating peoples behavior on the internet or online marketplace. the only enforcement mechanism is adding to a kind of public record for people and restricting or revoking people's access to various internets. but since so much stuff happens online i think eventually it would have a "governing" aspect that extended somewhat beyond just the computer sphere. the goal as a governance structure is natural law justice. so this is kind of the anti-nominalist / prescriptivist perspective of law/justice as an objective reality that arguably existed in christian society as the understanding of the role of authority prior to the rediscovery of the code of justinian in 1070.

**Q: For the 'public record' of behavior — is this more like a permanent ledger (everything ever, Merkle-chained), or does it have some concept of expungement/rehabilitation (offenses age out, can be forgiven)?**
A: There would be expungement in the sense that people would not be able to be prejudiced against you for that part of your record (that would be an injustice you could take to arbitration) but i think the record would probably have to be permanent otherwise it is too vulnerable to abuse.

**Q: Who has authority to expunge records? Is this the same authority that revokes licenses, a different body, or the aggrieved party themselves after some process?**
A: So you would basically have to have a court system. and the guiding principle is justice, so the question would be trying to discern "was there / is there an injustice being perpetrated here". i think people at some tier of authority would be able to add expungement to the chain but there would be a punishment for doing this in an unjust way / abusing that power.

**Q: For the court hierarchy — is this tied to geographic internets (local judge for local internet, regional appeals), tied to guilds/industries (woodworking guild handles woodworking disputes), or a separate parallel structure entirely?**
A: So basically the authority people have for punishment would be connected to the private internet they run. because you can imagine there being private internets for families, extended families, different kinds of communities, towns, larger regions, etc. so i think there would possibly be an ultimate authority connected to the app that let you act as a final tie breaker for authorities that were not organizing themselves into hierarchies where they agreed to have someone for appeal. but this would probably also take advantage in some cases of ai as a "neutral" objective judge to evaluate whether it seemed like there was an injustice in a particular case or not. this would also increase the throughput of arbitration. but you would be able to appeal. there would just be penalties for appeals you lost / frivolous & bad faith appeals so that people didn't abuse the system.

**Q: For AI as neutral judge — what does it actually evaluate? Evidence submitted by parties (like documents, transaction records), the semantic content of the dispute, witnesses/attestations, or some combination?**
A: Well you would have all the public internet records for anyone in authority/doing business. so for example all messages with a public figure would be available in an untampered way to try to prove a case. (based on graph database all that stuff, public service intelligence agency, all that stuff). and to some degree the other punishment/threat people have is just documenting unjust behavior and the ability of internets to defederate from someone if they have a documented history of unrepentent unjust behavior (as an internet owner).

**Q: For defederation — who decides to defederate? Each internet owner independently, or is there a threshold (e.g., 'if 3+ internets defederate from you, you're blacklisted from public internets')?**
A: Well ultimately each individual owns their internet so its up to them. but there would also probably be federation aggregators that people connect to that could also act as federation "de-aggregators" in a certain sense.

**Q: For the 'natural law justice' foundation — do you envision a codified set of principles (like a constitution/catechism that AI and humans reference), or is it more like case law that builds up precedent over time, or pure discernment case-by-case?**
A: So i think there would be codified principles but also ultimately it would be about the judgement of the people involved (and ai) if justice or injustice had been served. do want to get to "legalistic" about it in a certain sense because obviously that can be gamed to generate injustice at a certain point.

**Q: For the punishment spectrum — what's between 'warning' and 'license revocation'? Are there intermediate sanctions like temporary suspension, restricted access, financial penalties, or community service?**
A: It would be up to the authorities whose internet they were on when the offense was committed but the penalties would be "voluntary" with the ultimate threat being license revocation. but there would definitely be a focus (and right) to rehabilitation, so that people would not be in any punished state indefinitely if they are willing to rehabilitate.

**Q: For rehabilitation — what does that look like practically? Completing Scientia courses, time-based probation, making restitution to wronged parties, attestation from authority figures, or something else?**
A: Education/formation, Time-based probation, Restitution, Vouching/sponsorship, any of these things, could also be something kind of catholic penitence type thing.

**Q: For the Catholic penitence aspect — is this integrated into the system (e.g., a structured confession/reconciliation process within the app), or is it expected to happen externally (go to a priest) with the app just recording that it occurred?**
A: Well, i mean in the sense of like "praying a x numbers of rosaries" or whatever. if there is a way to build it into the app as a tracker or something that makes sense but i don't think you would be to focused on perfect confirmation. ultimately some things would be handled externally and the issue would just be that if you are faking doing some kind of rehabilitation process that in itself would probably have penalties.

**Q: How does this connect to commerce disputes specifically? If a buyer claims fraud or a seller claims non-payment, is this the same court system, or does Mercatura have its own dispute resolution that only escalates to the justice system for serious cases?**
A: Well ultimately this is kind of one system that is integrated with mercature but in theory you could imagine it being a module that people can use in a stand alone way if someone wanted to organize or run some kind of "ensuring justice" system like mediation stuff in a business or some other kind of group of people as well.

**Q: For the case/dispute data structure — what's the anatomy of a case? Presumably two parties, a claim, evidence, a judge/arbiter, ruling, and maybe appeals. What else is essential?**
A: I think there would be algorithms to pull relevant information from available sources, including message history. presumeably the conflict would involve a discovery process where certain things become "public" that would not otherwise like messages between a buyer and a seller, etc. to some degree it might be based on defendent providing information. i think you would not be super precedent focused because that can be gamed to create unjust outcomes.

**Q: For discovery — when messages 'become public' for a case, is this permanently public (part of the tamper-evident record), visible only to court participants, or something else?**
A: I'm not sure, i could see them being permanently public but it could be something that is restriced in some way. i would lean toward permanently public because it seems like lack of transparency is conducive to corruption but it would depend on what seemed like the just approach in particular scenarios, maybe you would have to accomodate limited disclosure.

**Q: For the AI judge role — is this a single canonical AI (same model/prompt for all cases for consistency), configurable per internet, or multiple AI 'judges' that can be compared/appealed between?**
A: Available ai is not a stable thing so there would probably be some kind of plugin architecture since available models will presumeably change over time.

**Q: For initiating a case — can anyone file a complaint against anyone, or are there standing requirements (you must be directly harmed, or represent someone who was)?**
A: Public interest, i think it would be a public interest thing, or there would be some kind of at least record of "injustices" that pepole could submit to whether they became a case or not. submitting something as an injustice might be discretionary/subjective but turning things into cases frivolously would eventually lead to punishment.

**Q: For the 'record of injustices' that haven't become cases — is this more like a public complaint board, a private tip line, or a pattern-detection system where multiple similar reports trigger review?**
A: Public board, Pattern detection, the idea is that whether we can do something about it or not, whether someone is potentially able to win a case or not, people should have a system to submit what they consider to be injustices and it is in the public interest to have a record of those and that is good material for authorities to plan and have available, kind of like bug reports.

**Q: For the ultimate authority (the app-level 'supreme court') — who runs this? Is it tied to whoever maintains/sells Lapideus, an elected body, appointed experts, or some algorithmic/AI system?**
A: It could be the app maintainer, it could potentially be priests or bishops, but ultimately it would be whoever people choose. i think the closest administrative model we have to try and emulate that is probably effective is the subsidiarity of the HRE where you have many levels of hierarchy, overlapping authorities, etc.

**Q: For 'overlapping authorities' — what happens when two authorities claim jurisdiction over the same dispute? First to claim wins, parties choose, higher authority decides, or something else?**
A: Well i would consider the model: every internet has an owner, they can eject people off the their internet. anyone can add a key to revoke blockhain (but possibly only authorities can see the key of users of their internet), and anyone can unrevoke a key on the blockchain. so people can abuse any of these abilities but i guess the main check is that people can be revoked or removed from an internet or disaggregated.

**Q: For the revocation blockchain — when someone adds a revocation, what information is included? Just the key and reason, or also evidence, the revoker's identity, timestamp, etc.?**
A: Probably documented and case reference. and all this will be tied to the "intent based" computing and graph database. so people would have to document intent for doing things like this, hopefully this would help with malicious stuff and fraud.

**Q: For protecting against coordinated attacks (e.g., 50 bad actors all file revocations against one innocent person) — is there a rate limit, reputation weighting, or some review before revocations take effect?**
A: You would want to cost to be high, so can have a permanent record (this is why you try to avoid people being anonymous) and you might also use ai screening but how to do it best is a good question. but you could have immediate effect or a review period depending on the situation.

**Q: How does this integrate with the daily sync model? If someone gets revoked, do they still get that day's batch, or is revocation immediate even though other changes batch?**
A: Well if data ownership is baked into the system almost like drm then they might not be able to access data from the revoked internet. but probably at least lose sync if you are kicked off a network.

**Q: For the name of this system — do you have something in mind, or should we brainstorm?**
A: Probably something like iustitia or lex naturalis.

**Q: Between Iustitia (Justice) and Lex Naturalis (Natural Law) — which feels more right?**
A: Iustitia would probably make more sense for the whole system, lex naturalis might be a focused sub component.

**Q: For first milestone — what's the minimum slice that proves this works?**
A: Complaint log.

**Q: For the complaint log first milestone — what minimum fields does each complaint need?**
A: Minimal. Who submitted, who is accused, what happened (text).

**Q: Is there anything about Iustitia I haven't asked about that's important to capture?**
A: No, we covered it.
