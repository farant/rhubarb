# Scientia (Encyclopedia/Education) - Raw Interview Brainstorm

Date: 2025-12-31

## Q&A Session

**Q: What feature do you want to build?**
A: Scientia.

**Q: When you imagine Scientia fully built — is the primary experience more like navigating a structured tree of knowledge (medieval encyclopedia), or following associative links between concepts (Wikipedia/hypertext), or progressing through curated sequences (courses/curriculum)?**
A: It would be a structured tree of sciences and learning each of them would be gamified through an extensible LCG system similar to Marvel Champions.

**Q: For the 'tree of sciences' — are you thinking of the classical medieval division (Trivium/Quadrivium, speculative vs practical), a modern academic taxonomy, or a trade/craft-focused taxonomy that maps to Mercatura earning paths?**
A: So I think the mistake with science is that based on the biases of the Greeks it excluded techne as basically beneath philosophy, so a lot of science is only based on more "philosophical" elements and then the applied part is its own thing. So instead you have for each science the applied part and the philosophical part. And then you just have sciences for every focus. For example why search the internet and forums for tips when you can just read about "the science of growing christmas trees" or "the science of selling christmas trees" and then if people develop new techniques or interesting philosophical insights based on the experience of the practice they have a single place where they can be added over time.

**Q: For each 'science' having both philosophical and applied parts — is this a fixed two-section structure (theory chapter + practice chapter), or more like a spectrum where some articles are pure theory, some pure technique, and most somewhere in between with explicit markers?**
A: Well it's applied science and philosophy which is not the same as theoretical. Philosophy is more about what you can learn about the truth itself or even mystical / theological speculation based on the patterns in the science. And I guess I would consider the "theoretical" stuff to often be a part of what we consider to be practical. As far as organization I think there would be standard categories and stuff sort of a "taxonomy of science" that you would find in every science so it's easy to orient yourself. And then there would also be a kind of "skill tree progression" of skills to practice and acquire, projects to build, etc.

**Q: For the 'taxonomy of science' that appears in every science — what are the standard categories you're envisioning? For example: History, Principles, Techniques, Tools, Materials, Projects, Philosophy, Masters (notable practitioners)?**
A: Yes, that list, but probably some additional ones as well. Like "complications", there would be a whole vocabulary of entities that are integrateable with Salve and Smaragda, etc.

**Q: You mentioned an 'extensible LCG system similar to Marvel Champions' for gamification — what aspects of Marvel Champions' design are you drawing from? The deck-building, the scenario/villain structure, the hero progression, the modular encounter sets?**
A: The fact that it is a solo game. And modular deck building. Basically card games on a certain level with arbitrary instructions are themselves state machine simulators so the idea is that you could use your deck as a "computer" that would help present you with a random selection from a set of known options and guide you through growing and practicing in a science you're studying. Kind of like Pokemon Go for studying with a card deck.

**Q: For the card deck as 'computer'/state machine — are the cards physical (you print them, shuffle real deck) or digital (the app simulates the deck), or both with sync between them?**
A: So the idea is that as you are interested in new subjects there is a printable card deck you can print out. And sometimes the deck will kind of act like a Smaragda simulation where you are choosing how to respond to interesting scenarios / encounters as a way for people to get accelerated experience of "customer service as a plumber" or something like that without having to actually go through the real experience. But it is a more engaging interactive way of doing it than just reading a narrative that lets people explore approaching problems in different ways.

**Q: For the printable card decks — who creates the card content? Is this curated by science 'editors' (like encyclopedia authors), crowdsourced from practitioners in that field, AI-generated from the knowledge base, or some combination?**
A: So every internet you are a part of potentially has content in any of the internet "domains" that are available. So your experience of the encyclopedia would be based on the combined internets you are a part of (some of which might be aggregators).

**Q: So Scientia content comes from federated internets — when multiple internets have content for the same science (e.g., 'Plumbing'), how is it presented? Merged into one view, shown as parallel versions with source attribution, or prioritized by some trust/authority model?**
A: Merged view. And probably there would be some pretty serious dedicated encyclopedia internets that are meant to be a long term best encyclopedia for the world, but that will probably also be a highly Catholic project. And people will be able to choose whatever combination of sources they want. In theory you will also probably be able to say "I want this internet but only their content in this particular area is in my encyclopedia but filter out everything contributed by this particular user", etc.

**Q: For the skill tree progression — what makes a skill 'acquired'? Is it self-attestation ('I learned this'), completing specific projects/exercises, passing some kind of assessment, or external validation (mentor/guild signs off)?**
A: Self-attestation, Project completion, Assessment/quiz, External validation, eventually there will be city state community centers / universities that try to practice every business / trade for their particular "city state" / region so that you don't lose the competency to do the trades domestically and this will probably allow for an extra level of validation as well.

**Q: For the card game mechanics specifically — what is the 'win condition' or goal of a study session? Completing a scenario, earning XP toward skill tree, collecting resources for projects, or something else entirely?**
A: Well I think as you go you will be able to unlock cards and add them to your deck, so in that sense it is kind of an "open world game" but there will probably be different ways to engage with it. Like basically to have it generic and expandable there will kind of be "entity cards" that represent different kinds of things but there will probably be different game modes you play where the entity cards are interacted with in different ways depending on their genus, etc possibly with some game specific cards. Kind of like how you can play many games with a standard deck of cards, or how LoL and TFT recycle the same characters and assets in a different way. So there might be a quiz mode, a "beat monsters" mode, it would depend on what the person playing it enjoys.

**Q: For 'entity cards' representing different kinds of things — what are the core entity types you envision on cards? Concepts (ideas to learn), Skills (abilities to practice), Scenarios (situations to navigate), Tools (things you use), People (masters/mentors)?**
A: Probably tools, resources, skills, people, locations but I can imagine there being other ones too.

**Q: For printing card decks — what's the physical format? Standard playing card size, tarot size, mini cards, or variable depending on content?**
A: Standard poker size.

**Q: For the relationship between Scientia and Mercatura — when someone progresses through a science's skill tree, does this unlock anything in the marketplace? Ability to sell in that category, guild eligibility, visible certifications on their business profile?**
A: It could potentially unlock things, but I don't think things would necessarily be hard gated. The idea is more like it's an extended gamified tutorial from a certain perspective. But you would be able to unlock badges / achievements probably because that is fun for people. If there is more rigorous requirements required that might just include actual qualification tests, portfolio, work experience, all that kind of normal stuff.

**Q: For the encyclopedia content itself (separate from cards) — what's the article format? Plain text with headers, STML markup with semantic structure, something closer to a textbook with exercises inline, or wiki-style with discussion/talk pages?**
A: So there is a fixed 16 color palette for everything, it is 640 by 720 with two panel widgets, I am using a single monospaced font. Probably the content will be available in a fully digital format or printable (or purchasable from marketplace) as a physical book. Ideally there would be high quality "book-like" content that you can read from start to finish that covers all the content and that is being improved across 100s of years. But there would probably be other good interactive widgets / simulations, etc as well.

**Q: For the 'book-like' content that can be read start to finish — is this one canonical book per science (like a definitive textbook), or multiple books at different levels (intro, intermediate, advanced), or different books from different authors/perspectives on the same science?**
A: One canonical.

**Q: For the canonical book per science — who has authority to edit it? A designated editor/author, a council of practitioners, anyone with reputation in that science, or the internet owner whose content it is?**
A: Well everything is editable and remixable to some degree? So I think the authorities would be people producing content -> internet owners -> person consuming the content can reorganize it/cherry pick paragraphs/add content to the version they are consuming as they see fit. For texts there would also probably be a gloss culture which is the closest thing to a "forum" that would be on the internet but it would be glossing particular paragraphs, sentences, etc.

**Q: The gloss culture is fascinating — are glosses attached to specific text ranges (like margin notes on a paragraph), or to semantic entities within the text (glossing a concept wherever it appears), or both?**
A: Every book in the system will attempt to be addressable by paragraph and by sentence, kind of like chapter and verse in the Bible.

**Q: For the paragraph/sentence addressing — when text is edited and paragraphs shift, do addresses stay stable (like verse numbers that don't change even if translation differs) or do they update to match current content?**
A: Probably some combination of version specific and content-following.

**Q: For the 'complications' category you mentioned earlier (integrating with Salve/Smaragda) — what does a 'complication' look like? Is it a scenario that can go wrong, a common mistake, an edge case requiring judgment, or something else?**
A: Emergent complexity that is not theoretically obvious but that you understand and observe through practice. Also basically the stuff that Smaragda is supposed to surface, it would use the "complication" terminology as well.

**Q: For the interactive widgets/simulations you mentioned — are these authored in Sputnik (your scripting language), hardcoded C widgets, or some declarative format that gets interpreted?**
A: Probably Sputnik scripts but I haven't thought about it too much. I don't want to give as much flexibility to do arbitrary GUI programs as JavaScript and the DOM allows so there might also be a library of simulation modes that are hardcoded that you can configure and plug together.

**Q: For the skill tree visualization — is this the same Canvas File Explorer spatial paradigm (nodes on infinite canvas, zoom to explore), a more traditional tree diagram, or something specific to learning paths?**
A: Probably it would be a dedicated widget for visualizing trees or even skill trees and rendering them in a nice way. There will also probably be dedicated widgets for viewing history timelines and visualizing graphs in a nice auto layout kind of way with lines between nodes, etc but I haven't figured out yet exactly how to do that since one of my hard UI rules is to not have any scrolling only pagination.

**Q: For the 'no scrolling only pagination' constraint with trees/graphs — are you thinking fixed-size chunks that you page through (show 10 nodes at a time), or zooming in/out changes what level of detail is visible, or something else?**
A: I think it would either be fixed chunks or possibly fixed chunks that you navigate like they are hyperlinks/folders where you click on a node in the fixed chunk and that takes you to another fixed chunk of leafs and possibly links to more nested chunks, etc.

**Q: For the card game modes you mentioned (quiz mode, 'beat monsters' mode, etc.) — how does the physical deck interact with progress tracking? Do you report results back to the app manually, scan something, or is the physical deck purely offline with separate digital tracking?**
A: I think if you are keeping it in sync the main thing might be saying what cards you've unlocked? Don't want to make it super onerous for people to be doing data entry about.

**Q: For unlocking cards — what triggers an unlock? Completing a chapter in the book, reaching a skill tree milestone, playing enough games, or progression through the actual content of the science?**
A: I think you would have something like you play a scenario with the cards and if you beat it it says "you unlocked these cards" but there would probably be cards you could download and mix together for any chapter you are reading. The idea is that in some game modes you can just mix any cards together and kind of use it as a deck building sandbox, almost like Scribblenauts or something.

**Q: For the deck-building sandbox aspect — can you combine cards across different sciences (e.g., mix plumbing tools with woodworking skills), or is each science's deck self-contained?**
A: Free mixing.

**Q: For the Iustitia integration — if Scientia is used for rehabilitation (offenders complete courses as part of sentence), does this require a different mode of engagement? Mandatory completion tracking, verified by authority, versus voluntary self-directed learning?**
A: I think that would be at the discretion of the authority assigning the sentence but in some cases I could imagine tests on the content or something like that.

**Q: For the philosophy/mystical aspect of each science — is this presented as one tradition's perspective (Catholic theology drawing connections), or ecumenically (various philosophical traditions' takes), or purely observational (patterns noticed without theological framing)?**
A: It would definitely be Catholic as far as I would be interested in it. I'm not sure the best way to do it because there are definite pitfalls but overall I would think of it as Aquinas's idea of being a Christian as contemplation and sharing the fruits of contemplation as well as Bonaventure's The Mind's Road to God as a sense of what you might expect to find.

**Q: For the naming within Scientia — are individual sciences named in Latin (e.g., 'Scientia Lignarii' for woodworking), English, or a hybrid with Latin for the system and vernacular for specific trades?**
A: Both available.

**Q: For discovering new sciences to learn — is browsing the tree the primary way, or are there recommendations based on what you already know, or connections from Mercatura ("people buying X often know Y"), or something else?**
A: Browse tree, Recommendations, Mercatura links, Social/guild, I think that could happen all kinds of ways but browsing the tree would always be an option. Probably one of the kinds of data that people can curate and make available on an internet would be curriculums that would be hooked into this data/content.

**Q: For 'curriculums' as curated learning paths — is a curriculum a sequence of sciences to study in order, a selection of content across sciences for a specific goal (like 'start a bakery'), or structured study schedules with Salve integration?**
A: All of the above and also specifically curriculums with activities and all that stuff that potentially homeschooling parents could print out or use in the home for different courses.

**Q: For homeschooling integration — does Scientia replace or supplement traditional textbooks? And is there age/grade level tagging, or is the skill tree progression the only difficulty indicator?**
A: It might replace textbooks because textbooks are not usually written super well but it is not trying to replace books and it would refer people to books as sources as relevant. But I think the idea is that if someone only had this available to them it would provide them with everything they needed to have a good curriculum. Not necessarily age based but progression based but maybe with different kinds of materials / exercises that are targeted at the attention span / interests of different ages.

**Q: For the 'tree of sciences' root structure — what are the top-level branches? Are you thinking something like: Trivium, Quadrivium, Trades, Domestic Arts, or a different organization entirely?**
A: Probably Classical + Trades is closest. Definitely not speculative vs practical because I think almost every science will have both to some degree. It's kind of like "Documenting Software Architecture: Views and Beyond" by Paul Clements, etc. though where I could imagine there being multiple browsable views of the tree so life domains, etc might exist as well.

**Q: For the card game specifically — what's the core interaction loop during play? Draw cards, make choices, see outcomes? Or something more like: encounter situation, play cards to respond, resolve consequences?**
A: That's the trick. You need something generic that is kind of like a simulation and that you can combine cards from anywhere. I could see taking elements from games like Distant Skies or Earthborne Rangers that give you a kind of overworld to explore, even to randomly generate an overworld with cards sort of similar to Settlers of Catan. Figuring out a fun card game is definitely going to be one of the challenges.

**Q: For the generated overworld idea — is this meant to represent a literal space (town you're building, forest you're exploring), or more abstract (knowledge landscape, career path), or metaphorical (journey through mastery)?**
A: I'm not sure. Probably a literal space but abstract could make sense as well? Games like Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion or Distant Skies that have a ringbound book where the pages themselves are an overworld map that has encounters, etc might also be an idea.

**Q: For the printable book/map format like Jaws of the Lion — would this be part of the printable output from Scientia (generate your learning journey as a physical book with map pages), or a separate game product, or both?**
A: Well that actually could be interesting to have generated pages as kind of like a "roguelike experience" that people could print out themselves. They would be a dimension included in Scientia and people could probably author or configure the random generation same as creating any other kind of content.

**Q: For the roguelike generated experience — what seeds the randomness? Your current skill level, sciences you're studying, time of year, or true random with replayable seed codes?**
A: Any information that seems relevant that is in the database I guess, so it could be all of those things or any of those things. Also it's possible if you have hex maps like Jaws of the Lion that you would have things like 3D printable figurines for player characters or mobs. These are things that seem like they could be accessible for people to do at home or for people to do as cottage businesses which is a desirable side effect always to make different kind of job niches available.

**Q: For 3D printable figurines — are the STL files part of Scientia content (like cards/books), purchasable via Mercatura, or both? And who designs them — science authors, dedicated 3D artists, community contributors?**
A: I think they would be bundled with the Scientia content. And I don't think you would have a scenario where people are paying for STL, instead easily paying for someone to print them for them if they can't themselves.

**Q: For the first milestone of Scientia — what's the minimum slice that proves the concept works and is actually useful?**
A: Probably either a single science demo or a card system. Another project is creating a new unified math curriculum that uses lisp syntax and operators and teaches everything based on graph theory first so that might be useful to develop at the same time.

**Q: For the lisp-syntax math curriculum — is this meant to be the 'Mathematica' science within Scientia (teaching math via this approach), or a separate tool/notation system that Scientia uses for math content, or both?**
A: I guess both integrated and potentially a foundational layer? The idea is to make math waay more accessible and to provide people access to advanced math. So it would be nice if this system was used for math across all the sciences as appropriate.

**Q: For 'graph theory first' approach to math — is this because graphs are more intuitive, because they unify many concepts, because they're more computational/practical, or something else?**
A: All reasons.

**Q: For the lisp-syntax specifically — is this a custom notation you're designing, an existing system like Scheme/Racket, or building on something like the formulas in your STML expression system?**
A: It would probably just be kind of like lisp in the sense that you would have s expressions for operators? And you would have long readable names for operators with kebab-case identifiers. The idea is just that you want to make it easier to parse a math expression without the additional barrier of weird syntax. Plus maybe being able to define "macros" that describe the intent of what something is doing where to a beginner it might not be clear why a set of operations are being applied because they don't understand that it's a normal tool to get a certain effect.

**Q: For the readable macros describing intent — is this like a 'literate math' where operations have natural language explanations inline, or more like named procedures that hide complexity ('find-derivative-of' instead of seeing the limit definition)?**
A: The core is lower level than named procedures, the most important thing is to have named operators that are not weird symbols and have the order of operations be clear.

**Q: Is there anything about Scientia I haven't asked about that's important to capture in the spec?**
A: Covered everything.
