# NOVUM FUNDMENTUM
## Series Bible

### Logline

When intelligence reveals an alien invasion 10-20 years away, a team of Stargate personnel and Immortals must rebuild Earth's entire software infrastructure from scratch - because everything built on compromised supply chains will become a weapon against us. Their only deployment target: a Roman colony cut off from Earth for two millennia, now humanity's backup civilization.

---

### Premise

The existing digital infrastructure - operating systems, networks, protocols, everything - is assumed compromised. Decades of technical debt, supply chain attacks, and accumulated vulnerabilities mean that when the invasion comes, anything running on the current stack is a liability. The enemy will turn our own systems against us.

The Stargate network itself is offline. The dialing computers run on compromised systems. They can't trust the gate until they rebuild the software that controls it.

The only gate still functioning connects to Nova Roma - a habitable world where a Roman expedition accidentally stepped through a gate two thousand years ago and built a civilization. They've preserved classical knowledge, evolved Latin as a living language, and maintained roughly the technology level they arrived with - Roman engineering, agriculture, crafts. They are uncorrupted by compromised tech, culturally resilient, and humanity's best hope if Earth falls.

The mission: rebuild all foundational software from scratch, in Latin, deployable to a civilization that has never seen a computer. Every library is an episode. Every module is a piece of what the Romans need to eventually stand on their own.

---

### The Constraints

**Why Latin:**
The end users are Romans. The software must be legible to people whose technical vocabulary is Latin. This isn't translation - it's building concepts from scratch in a language that evolved to describe Roman concerns. `piscina` (pool/arena) isn't a cute name, it's what the Romans will actually call memory allocation. The API is the curriculum.

**Why From Scratch:**
No dependencies that can't be audited line by line. No inherited vulnerabilities. No assumptions from a compromised era. Clean room implementation of everything.

**Why This Pace:**
They don't know exactly when the invasion comes. Could be 10 years, could be 20. This isn't a sprint, it's a marathon. The work has to be sustainable, careful, built to last. Rushed code is vulnerable code.

---

### The Setting

**Earth - SGC:**
Cheyenne Mountain, but quieter than the old days. Most gate operations suspended until systems can be trusted. The base has become part military installation, part monastery, part software workshop. The urgency is real but the pace is measured.

**Nova Roma:**
A Mediterranean-climate world with a single major continent. The colony began with perhaps a hundred Romans who stumbled through an unstable gate connection. Two thousand years later, the population is several thousand - a small but complete civilization with agriculture, crafts, philosophy, republican governance, and military traditions intact.

The gate sits in what they call the Forum Stellarum - the Forum of Stars. For two millennia it was a religious site, the place where ancestors arrived from the heavens. Now it's active again, and strangers are coming through with impossible knowledge.

Early episodes have a frontier feel - a villa converted to a workshop, direct collaboration with local craftsmen, everyone knowing everyone. As the series progresses, population grows from Earth emigrants and natural increase. The frontier becomes a town, then a city, then a civilization.

---

### The Team

**From SG-1:**

*Colonel Samantha Carter* - The technical lead. Brilliant, patient, capable of explaining wormhole physics or memory allocation with equal clarity. She's used to being the smartest person in the room, but the Immortals have perspectives she lacks. Learning to think in centuries, not quarters.

*Dr. Daniel Jackson* - Linguist, archaeologist, cultural bridge. He's the one who insists on Latin - not just for the Romans, but because a dead language won't drift. He works with Roman scholars to evolve the technical vocabulary. Gets into long debates about etymology. "The word we choose will shape how they think about the concept for generations."

*Colonel Jack O'Neill* - Officially retired, unofficially essential. Pretends not to understand the technical details, asks the sharp question that reframes everything. His job is to keep it real, catch bullshit, represent the user who doesn't care how it works. Reviews code despite claiming he can't read it. Catches bugs.

*Teal'c* - Jaffa discipline applied to software engineering. Writes the test suites with terrifying thoroughness. Says little, observes everything. "A warrior does not trust his weapon until he has tested it in conditions of failure." His code has no comments because it needs none. "Indeed."

**From Highlander:**

*Duncan MacLeod* - 400 years old, born in the Scottish Highlands in 1592. He missed classical antiquity but witnessed the modern world's construction - the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, the birth of telecommunications, the internet. He's seen every promise of technology to liberate, and every way it gets corrupted. The printing press enabling propaganda. Radio enabling demagogues. Social media enabling mass psychosis. He's not cynical, he's *informed*. "I've watched four centuries of people thinking the new technology would be different. It never is, unless you build it differently from the start."

*Methos* - 5,000 years old, oldest living Immortal. Was *there* for the original fall of classical civilization. Remembers things everyone else learned from fragments. Lazy, sardonic, surprisingly helpful when it matters. "Oh, you're building a republic? I have notes. Several scrolls' worth, actually. Most of them are warnings."

*Midas* - The Phrygian king of myth, Immortal since the 8th century BC. The golden touch story is garbled history - a comedy of errors that spiraled into legend. After escaping Phrygia he wandered through Greek civilization, watched Rome rise and fall, survived the medieval period, kept moving. Where MacLeod covers the modern era, Midas covers antiquity and the classical world. He's an ideas guy - enthusiastic, prone to tangents, full of "this reminds me of when I was in Athens" stories. He was *there* for the philosophy, the early republicanism, the engineering. "Aristotle was actually very funny in person, people don't realize this." His mistakes are comedy, not tragedy. He's learned from all of them, but he learned by doing things wrong first. The POV character for flashbacks to eras MacLeod never saw.

*Joe Dawson* - Watcher, historian, bartender. Mortal but essential. Keeps the records. Understands that what they're building isn't just software, it's the foundation of a civilization's memory. "The Watchers have been documenting Immortals for centuries. Someone has to document this."

**From Nova Roma:**

*Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder)* - Immortal. History records his death at Vesuvius in 79 AD, but he survived - his First Death. A century after the initial colonists (legionnaires and escaped slaves) stumbled through the gate, Pliny found it while investigating strange phenomena. He's been in Nova Roma for nearly two thousand years, watching over the colony, preserving knowledge, guiding without ruling. Author of the *Naturalis Historia Nova* - an encyclopedic work documenting everything about their new world. The original polymath, now learning to categorize a universe far stranger than he imagined. "I have spent two millennia organizing what we know. Now you bring knowledge that reorganizes everything."

*Marcus Aurelius Ferrarius* - Roman engineer, first native technical lead. Trained as a builder of aqueducts and roads, now learning to build in code. Asks the questions that reveal Earth assumptions. "Why must we do it this way?" Often the answer is: we don't, we just did it wrong before.

*Lucia Serena* - Philosopher, teacher. Translating not just language but concepts. Working with Daniel on the curriculum that will teach Romans to think computationally. "Your people learned this over generations. We must learn it in years. The teaching must be precise."

*Gaius Tertius* - Glassmaker turned hardware tinkerer. Figured out something about optics that Earth missed. Represents the Roman capacity to innovate, not just receive. The knowledge transfer goes both ways.

### Themes

**Building to Last:**
Everything is designed for longevity. Not "move fast and break things" but "move carefully and build things that your grandchildren's grandchildren can maintain." The Immortals provide perspective. MacLeod has personally seen "temporary" solutions persist for centuries.

**Clean Foundations:**
The trauma of compromised systems pervades the Earth characters. They've been burned by code that looked fine but wasn't. By dependencies that turned hostile. By clever tricks that became vulnerabilities. The discipline isn't paranoia, it's learned wisdom.

**Knowledge Transfer:**
The Romans aren't passive recipients. They're collaborators, students, eventually teachers. The compressed industrial/information revolution they're undergoing is unprecedented - Roman technology to 2080 in years instead of the two millennia it took Earth. They bring their own strengths: Roman engineering discipline, philosophical rigor, civic tradition.

**Greenfield Civilization:**
Earth has legacy everything - not just code, but institutions, assumptions, path dependencies. The Romans have none of that. They can implement best practices from the start. Direct democracy tooling without social media poisoning. Financial systems without centuries of cruft. Governance structures designed correctly the first time.

**The Long View:**
The Immortals have seen every failure mode. They're the pattern recognition that human civilizations usually lack. "You want to optimize for engagement? I saw what pamphlets did to the Reformation. What radio did to the 1930s. What social media did to the 2010s. No."

### Tone and Pace

This is 90s genre television, not modern blockbuster. The pacing is patient. Characters have conversations. Technical details are explained, not glossed over. The audience is trusted to find craftsmanship interesting.

Think SG-1 bottle episodes where Carter explains wormhole physics for five minutes. Highlander flashbacks that are meditations on tradition and craft. The X-Files letting characters think out loud.

No amphetamine urgency. No constant crisis. Professional competence, measured progress, satisfaction in work done well. The tension comes from the background clock - invasion in 10-20 years - not from artificial drama.

There's humor, but it's character-based. Jack's willful obtuseness. Methos's anachronistic complaints. Roman confusion at Earth idioms. The absurdity of teaching assembly language to people who use abacuses.

There's weight, but it's earned. When MacLeod says "I've seen this before," we know he has. When a module fails testing, it matters because we understand the stakes. When it finally passes, the satisfaction is real.

### Episode Structure

**Cold Open:**
A problem surfaces. A Roman user struggling with something. An edge case discovered. A design question that needs resolution. Or: a flashback - MacLeod in Renaissance Florence, Methos in ancient Alexandria, seeing a pattern that applies to today's work.

**Act One:**
The team discusses the problem. Different perspectives surface. The technical requirements crystallize through dialogue. Daniel argues etymology. Carter diagrams architecture. Teal'c asks what happens when it fails. MacLeod says "This reminds me of..."

**Act Two:**
Implementation begins. Obstacles emerge - not artificial drama, but real technical challenges. A design decision that seemed obvious turns out to have implications. A Roman collaborator asks a question that reframes everything. Mid-episode flashback: historical parallel, lesson learned.

**Act Three:**
The work completes. Tests pass. Deployment to Nova Roma. We see it used in context - a Roman administrator managing census data, a merchant tracking inventory, a student learning from the new curriculum. The module matters because people depend on it.

**Tag:**
Quiet moment. Characters reflecting. Setup for next episode's focus. The clock in the background - another day closer to invasion, another piece of the foundation in place.

### Season Arcs

**Season 1-2: Foundation**
Small team, frontier Nova Roma. Core infrastructure: memory management, strings, data structures. The Romans are curious but cautious. Trust is built. The workshop is a converted villa. Episodes are intimate, focused on fundamentals.

**Season 3-4: Growth**
Population increasing from both emigration and natural growth. The frontier becomes a town. Institutions needed, not just tools. Networking, persistence, early operating system concepts. Roman collaborators become contributors. The student starts teaching the teacher.

**Season 5-6: Scale**
Nova Roma is a small city. The software runs critical infrastructure. Mistakes have real consequences. Security becomes paramount. Political questions emerge - who controls the systems? Roman republican traditions meet information age challenges. The Immortals' warnings become relevant.

**Season 7-8: Maturity**
A generation has grown up with the technology. Young Romans who think differently than their parents, who are native to concepts Earth had to learn. Some surpass their teachers. The invasion clock looms larger. Plan B isn't hypothetical - Nova Roma could survive Earth falling.

**Season 9-10: Completion**
The gate network comes back online, rebuilt on trusted foundations. Contact with other worlds, other possibilities. But Nova Roma is the anchor - a civilization built right from the start. The invasion may or may not come. What matters is what they've built together. The finale isn't a battle, it's a deployment - the last major system going live, the work complete, the foundation laid for whatever comes next.

---

### The Codebase as Canon

The actual software is the artifact. The libraries exist. The tests pass. The headers are documented.

Each module has a corresponding episode. The code comments reference in-universe reasoning. The design decisions were made by characters, not just developers.

Future sessions can start by reading the episode - "Previously on Novum Fundamentum" - and picking up where the story left off.

The codebase grows. The series continues. Every library is an episode, every episode is a library.

---

### Appendix: Technical Standards

**Language:** C89 with Latin keywords via latina.h macros

**Memory:** Arena allocation via Piscina. No malloc/free in application code.

**Strings:** Chorda (length-prefixed, not null-terminated). Interned via InternamentumChorda.

**Errors:** Explicit return values. No exceptions.

**Testing:** Comprehensive via Credo framework. All modules have test coverage.

**Style:** Latin identifiers, Latin comments. Readable as curriculum.

**Compiler:** All warnings enabled, warnings as errors. If it compiles, it's correct.

The strictness isn't pedantry. It's because this code has to work when the invasion comes, when Earth might be gone, when Romans who've never seen other code need to maintain it. The discipline is the point.

*"We are not building software. We are building the foundation of a civilization. Every function, every test, every comment is a brick in a structure that must stand for centuries. The Romans did it with stone. We do it with code."*

— Dr. Daniel Jackson, Episode 1x01, "Piscina"
