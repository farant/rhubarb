Summary = """
The Catalog of Copyright Entries is an official publication of the United States Copyright Office, part of the Library of Congress. This particular volume contains renewal registrations - the records of copyright holders who renewed their original copyrights (which under pre-1978 US copyright law required active renewal after an initial 28-year term). The catalog is organized alphabetically by author or title and includes bibliographic information about the original work and its renewal status. These catalogs are invaluable for determining the copyright status of older works and are frequently used by researchers, publishers, and archivists.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1966 is derived from the renewal registration dates visible in the entries (e.g., "22Dec66", "3Jan67") and the page reference "1966_h2" in the markup. This is a government document published serially, not a literary work per se. The specific volume appears to cover late 1966 to early 1967 renewal registrations. As a US government publication, it is in the public domain.
