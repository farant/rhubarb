Looking at this text, I can identify it as "Creative Impulse in Industry: A Proposition for Educators" by Helen Marot, published in 1918. This is a work of non-fiction dealing with education and industrial labor from the Progressive Era.

Helen Marot was a labor activist and writer (not a Catholic author), and this work examines the relationship between education, creativity, and industrial work. The dedication to Caroline Pratt (founder of the City and Country School) and the preface by the Bureau of Educational Experiments situate this firmly in the progressive education reform movement of the early 20th century.
