Summary = """
This is a historical work by American historian and francophile Thomas Balch about the French involvement in the American Revolutionary War during 1777-1783. The book is divided into two parts: the first discusses the causes and origins of the War of Independence, summarizes the events of the war up to 1781, and provides a complete account of the French expeditionary corps under the command of the Comte de Rochambeau. This work documents the crucial French military and naval support that helped secure American independence, including the role of figures like Rochambeau and Lafayette, and the decisive French naval victory that led to the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781.
"""
