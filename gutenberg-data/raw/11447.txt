Summary = """
This is an issue of The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, a popular Victorian weekly magazine published in London from 1822 to 1849. The magazine provided middle-class readers with accessible articles on science, literature, history, and curiosities of the day. This particular issue from November 28, 1829 features an article about the famous conjoined twins Chang and Eng Bunker, who came to be known as the "Siamese Twins" (a term that originated from their case). The article describes their arrival in the Western world and their exhibition, reflecting the Victorian era's fascination with natural curiosities and scientific phenomena.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1829 is the publication date printed on the periodical itself. This represents a specific historical moment when Chang and Eng Bunker first arrived in the Western world and became public sensations. The twins themselves lived from 1811 to 1874, but this document captures contemporary reporting of their introduction to European and American audiences.
