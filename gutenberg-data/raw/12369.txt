Looking at this text, I can identify this as the opening of a major anthology project edited by Charles Dudley Warner. This is the preface to "Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern," a massive 45-volume compilation published in the late 19th century.

Summary = """
This is the first volume of a comprehensive 45-volume anthology that aimed to present a representative selection of world literature from all periods and cultures to American readers. Edited by Charles Dudley Warner (1829-1900), a prominent American essayist and novelist who was Mark Twain's neighbor and collaborator, this ambitious project compiled excerpts and complete works from ancient to modern times across all major literary traditions. The collection included interpretive essays by contemporary scholars to provide context and analysis. It was one of the most ambitious literary compilation projects of the 19th century, attempting to create a true "library" of human thought and literary achievement accessible to middle-class American households.
"""

Notes = """
The main edition was published 1896-1897 by R.S. Peale and J.A. Hill in New York. Various "Connoisseur" and deluxe editions followed. Warner was chosen as editor due to his literary reputation and editorial experience. This work represents the late Victorian impulse toward encyclopedic knowledge compilation and democratization of high culture. While not specifically Catholic, the collection would have included works by Catholic authors as part of its comprehensive scope.
