Summary = """
This is Volume I of a series on Egypt and Chaldea written by E. A. Wallis Budge, who served as Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum. The work examines ancient Egyptian beliefs about death, the afterlife, and the journey of the soul after death. Budge was a prolific Egyptologist whose translations and writings, while sometimes criticized by modern scholars for their interpretations, were foundational in making Egyptian religious texts accessible to English-speaking audiences. This volume explores Egyptian eschatology, including concepts of judgment, the afterlife realms, and the fate of the soul.
