Summary = """
This is the second volume of William James Stillman's autobiography. Stillman (1828-1901) was an American journalist, diplomat, photographer, and art critic who had a remarkably varied career. This volume covers his consular service in Crete during the Cretan insurrections of the 1860s, his time in Athens, his relationships with artists like Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelite circle, his return to journalism, and his extensive war correspondence covering the Balkan conflicts of the 1870s, including the Herzegovinian insurrection and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877. The autobiography provides firsthand accounts of significant diplomatic and military events in the Mediterranean and Balkans during a turbulent period of European history.
"""

Notes = """
1901 is the publication year shown in the original text. This appears to be published near the end of Stillman's life (he died in 1901). The work covers events primarily from the 1860s-1870s but was written retrospectively around 1900-1901.
