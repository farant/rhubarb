Summary = """
A collection of Christmas stories by Madame de La Ville de Mirmont, a French author. The excerpt shown is from "Nuit de Noël" (Christmas Night), dedicated to Jean, which depicts a warm Christmas Eve scene in a rustic home with an old oak-paneled room, a Christmas tree from the local mountain forest, and a large Yule log burning in the fireplace. The narrative has a pastoral, sentimental quality typical of turn-of-century French Christmas literature, referencing a pastor's family and the generous Father Jousse who raised the tree for the children.
