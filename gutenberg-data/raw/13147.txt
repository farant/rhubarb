Summary = """
This volume contains two plays by Leonid Andreyev (1871-1919), a major Russian Expressionist playwright and short story writer. "Savva" (1906) tells the story of a revolutionary who plots to destroy a miraculous icon to liberate people from religious superstition, only to face tragic consequences. "The Life of Man" (1907) is an allegorical play depicting the stages of human existence from birth to death, with a mysterious gray figure ("Someone in Gray") observing throughout. Both plays exemplify Andreyev's pessimistic philosophical outlook and his experimental dramatic techniques that influenced Expressionist theater.
