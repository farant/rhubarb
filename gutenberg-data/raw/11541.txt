Notes = """
The year 1832 is the actual publication date of this specific issue. The Mirror was published from 1822-1849. This is a straightforward case where the publication date is clearly stated in the masthead. The content discusses buildings constructed "within the last half century" and references contemporary sources like the Edinburgh Review No. 109, confirming this as the primary source date.
