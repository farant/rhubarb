I need to analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the title, author, year, and other metadata.

From the text provided, I can see:

**Title**: "Мислите в главите" (Thoughts in Heads) - this is shown both in Cyrillic and translated to English
**Author**: Хари Стоянов (Harry Stojan/Harry Stoyanov) - a Bulgarian author
**Copyright year**: 1976, published in Varna (Варна)
**Language**: Bulgarian (в българско/In Bulgarian)
**Genre**: "Гимназиален роман" (High-school Novel/Gymnasium Novel)

This appears to be a Bulgarian young adult or school novel from the Communist era (1976). The title refers to "thoughts in heads" and it's described as a gymnasium (high school) novel, suggesting it deals with teenage/student life. Given the 1976 date and Bulgarian origin during the Communist period, this would not be a Catholic work. The author Хари Стоянов (Harry Stoyanov) appears to be a Bulgarian writer from that era.

Notes = """
Published in 1976 during Bulgaria's Communist period. The work is in Bulgarian and represents Bulgarian youth literature of that era. Not appropriate to tag as 'appropriate-for-children' without reading the full content, and definitely not a Catholic work given the author, time period, and cultural context.
