Summary = """
This is the third volume of George Sand's collected correspondence, covering letters from 1812 to 1876. George Sand (pseudonym of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin, 1804-1876) was one of the most prolific and celebrated French authors of the 19th century. Her correspondence is a treasure trove of literary and social history, documenting her relationships with major figures of French Romanticism including Chopin, Musset, Flaubert, and Balzac. This particular letter from February 1848 is addressed to her son Maurice, discussing family business matters and the Paris Salon jury - written just days before the February Revolution would overthrow the July Monarchy.
"""

Notes = """
Year 1883 chosen as this is when Calmann Lévy published this "Quatrième Édition" (fourth edition) of the collected correspondence. While Sand's letters span decades earlier, this compilation as a published work dates to the early 1880s posthumous editions. The letters themselves are primary historical documents but the work as published is an 1883 editorial compilation.
