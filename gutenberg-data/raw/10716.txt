Summary = """
A scholarly essay examining epic poetry as a species of literature rather than as a subject for sociological or archaeological study. Abercrombie distinguishes his literary approach from the scientific/anthropological approaches of scholars like Gilbert Murray and Andrew Lang. The work analyzes epic poetry's literary qualities and draws on contemporary scholarship including J.W. Mackail's lectures on Greek poetry and H.M. Chadwick's "The Heroic Age." This essay represents early 20th-century Anglo-American formalist literary criticism applied to the epic tradition.
