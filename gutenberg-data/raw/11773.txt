Looking at this text, I can identify this as a Finnish play. The title page clearly shows:

**KULLERVO** - A play in five acts ("Näytelmä viidessä näytöksessä") by **Aleksis Kivi**, with a publication date of 1919 shown.

However, there's important historical context here. Aleksis Kivi (1834-1872) was Finland's national author who wrote this play much earlier. "Kullervo" was written around 1860 and first published in 1864. The 1919 date appears to be a later edition/printing.

The play is based on the tragic Kullervo story from the Kalevala (Finnish national epic). It features characters from Finnish mythology including Väinämöinen, Ilmarinen, and Lemminkäinen, with Kullervo as the tragic protagonist.

Notes = """
While the Gutenberg text shows 1919, this appears to be a later edition. The play was originally written around 1860 and first published in 1864. Using 1864 as the historically significant date for a timeline of literary works. Not marked 'catholic' as this is Finnish mythology-based literature from a Lutheran cultural context.
