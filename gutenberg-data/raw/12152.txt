Summary = """
"Keeping Watch" is a short story that is part of W.W. Jacobs' collection "Night Watches" (1914). W.W. Jacobs (1863-1943) was an English author best known for his humorous short stories about dockside and seafaring life, as well as his famous horror story "The Monkey's Paw." This story features his recurring character of the night-watchman, who serves as a narrator and commentator on human nature. Jacobs' night-watchman stories are characterized by their gentle humor, keen observations of working-class life, and the watchman's philosophical musings on relationships and human behavior. These tales were immensely popular in their time and showcase Jacobs' skill at dialect and character-driven comedy.
