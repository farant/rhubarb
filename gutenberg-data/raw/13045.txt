A collection of essays on British financial policy during World War I, written by Hartley Withers, a prominent British financial journalist and editor of The Economist (1916-1921).

"""

Notes = """
The book was published in 1919, collecting essays written during the war years (1914-1918). I chose 1919 as it represents the publication date of the collected work, which provides the historical context of immediate post-war financial reflection.
