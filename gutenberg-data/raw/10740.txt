"""

Notes = """
James Allen published "The Way of Peace" in 1907, shortly after his most famous work "As a Man Thinketh" (1903). While Allen was influenced by Christian mysticism and uses Christian terminology, his work represents the New Thought movement rather than orthodox Christian theology. The book has a universalist spiritual orientation rather than being specifically Catholic or aligned with Catholic teaching, so it would not receive a nihil obstat or imprimatur. The publication year of 1907 represents when Allen wrote and published this specific work.
