"""

Notes = """
The publication year 1917 is explicitly stated in the text itself. Oppenheim was not a Catholic author, and his works were popular entertainment fiction rather than literature with religious themes, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply. While his novels were widely read, they were adult mystery/thriller fiction and would not typically be considered appropriate for children due to themes of murder and adult situations.
