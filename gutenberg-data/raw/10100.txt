Summary = """
This is a comprehensive biography of George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron (1788-1824), one of the leading figures of the Romantic movement in English poetry. Written by John Nichol, a Scottish scholar and professor of English Literature at Glasgow University, this work was part of the influential "English Men of Letters" series edited by John Morley. The biography traces Byron's life from his ancestry and troubled childhood through his years at Cambridge, his travels across Europe, his scandalous marriage and separation, his self-imposed exile in Italy and Switzerland, and finally his death in Greece while supporting the Greek War of Independence. Nichol provides literary analysis of Byron's major works including "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage," "Don Juan," "Manfred," and "Cain," while examining the tumultuous personal life that both inspired and complicated his literary legacy.

Notes = """
The year 1880 reflects the original publication date of this biography in the "English Men of Letters" series. This was a Victorian-era assessment of Byron, written roughly 56 years after the poet's death, and represents 19th-century scholarly perspective on Byron's controversial life and literary achievements.
