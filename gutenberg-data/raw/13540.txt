Summary = """
Notes and Queries was a weekly periodical founded in London in 1849, still published today. It served as a forum for scholars, antiquaries, literary men, and curious readers to pose questions and share answers on matters of history, literature, language, folklore, heraldry, and genealogy. The format was simple: readers submitted "queries" on obscure topics, and other readers responded with "notes" providing information. This particular issue (No. 53, November 2, 1850) includes discussions on Shakespeare and Marlowe, proposals for a Church-History Society, notes on the historian Burnet, and various minor queries ranging from the etymology of "Cheshire Cat" to questions about Steele's burial place. The motto "When found, make a note of" comes from Captain Cuttle in Dickens's Dombey and Son (1848).
