Looking at this text, I can see it's the front matter from Project Gutenberg ebook 12067, which appears to be a collection of Frank R. Stockton's works. However, this particular listing page is just advertising/catalog material for his various books.

Based on the Gutenberg ID (12067) and the collection advertised, this appears to be **"The Bee-Man of Orn and Other Fanciful Tales"** by Frank R. Stockton, originally published in 1887.

Let me provide the structured output:
