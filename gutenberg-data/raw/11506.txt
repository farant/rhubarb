Summary = """
This is a historical work by Henry C. Watson focused on the American Revolution, particularly centering on Philadelphia in 1776 and the Liberty Bell (referred to as "The Old Bell of Independence"). The book is part of "The Young American's Library" series and contains stories about the patriots and heroes of the War of Independence. Watson structures the narrative around veteran storytellers sharing accounts of the Revolution's chief figures, using the Liberty Bell as a symbolic rallying point. The work aims to instill veneration for the founding fathers and inspire emulation of their example in young Americans. Watson also authored other works about the American Revolution including "The Camp-Fires of the American Revolution" and "The Yankee Tea-Party, or Boston in 1773."
