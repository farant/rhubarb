Notes = """
Published in 1897, though the story itself is set around 1805 during Napoleon's preparations at Boulogne. This is the year of publication for the novel itself, not the historical period it depicts. Conan Doyle was not Catholic (he was raised Catholic but became a Spiritualist later in life), so this work does not receive the 'catholic' tag.
