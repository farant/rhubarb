I recognize this as Adolphe Thiers' famous work on the French Revolution. Let me analyze what we have here:

This is "Histoire de la Révolution française" (History of the French Revolution) by Adolphe Thiers, Volume 6 (Tome Sixième), covering the National Convention period. The text explicitly states it was published in 1824 at the top.

This is a major historical work - Thiers was a French historian and statesman who wrote this comprehensive history of the French Revolution. The work was published in multiple volumes between 1823-1827, with this volume appearing in 1824. This is a historical analysis, not a primary source document from the Revolutionary period itself.

The passage discusses the actions of the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre, Saint-Just, and the executions of various political factions during the Terror. This is serious academic historical writing from the early 19th century perspective.
