Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly magazine published from 1822 to 1849. It was one of the earliest cheap periodicals aimed at the general reading public, priced at just twopence. The magazine contained a miscellany of articles on topics including literature, history, science, the arts, and popular culture. This particular issue (Vol. 12, No. 330) from September 6, 1828 includes an article discussing why the English are not considered a "musical people" despite having royal patronage of music and Italian opera houses in London.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1828 is taken directly from the issue date printed in the periodical header. As a weekly magazine, each issue represents contemporary journalism from its publication date. The magazine was founded by John Limbird and was notable for making reading material accessible to working-class audiences at a time when books and periodicals were expensive.
