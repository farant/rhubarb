Summary = """
'Deadham Hard' is a romance novel by Lucas Malet (pseudonym of Mary St. Leger Harrison, daughter of Charles Kingsley). Published in 1919, the novel is set in the fictional English coastal location of Deadham Hard. The work follows the story of a humanist who becomes a hermit and involves various characters including a young scholar. Malet was known for her psychologically complex novels that often explored themes of identity, social conventions, and human nature. This novel, like much of her work, features careful character development and explores the tensions between past and present, youth and age, as suggested by the Bulgarian proverb epigraph: "Youth has no boundaries, age has the grave."
