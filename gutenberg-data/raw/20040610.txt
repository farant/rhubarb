Notes = """
The date is explicitly stated in the masthead: Saturday, July 4, 1829. This is a specific issue of a periodical rather than a standalone book, so "Various" is appropriate for the author field as these magazines typically featured anonymous or multiple contributors. The magazine cost 2 pence per issue and was transitioning to a new typeface in this volume, as indicated by the editor's introductory remarks about the "new type" beginning their Fourteenth Volume.
