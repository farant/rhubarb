Summary = """
This is a volume in the 'Religions Ancient and Modern' series published by Archibald Constable & Co. The work by J. Allanson Picton (M.A., author of 'The Religion of the Universe') examines pantheism as a philosophical and religious concept, tracing its historical development and exploring its significance across different cultures and time periods. Pantheism is the belief that God and the universe are identical, or that all reality is divine. The series was designed to present salient features of great religions, philosophies, and cultural achievements to a broad public audience. Other volumes in the series covered Greek religion, animism, Chinese religions, Islam, Buddhism, and other topics.
