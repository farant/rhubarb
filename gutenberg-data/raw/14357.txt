This is an expository work by Welsh philosopher Abel J. Jones introducing English-speaking readers to the philosophy of Rudolf Eucken, the German idealist philosopher who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1908. The book aims to provide a clear and accessible summary of Eucken's philosophical and ethical teachings, which emphasized spiritual activism and the importance of an inner life transcending mere naturalism. Eucken was known for his optimistic, religiously-tinged idealism that sought to reconcile scientific modernity with spiritual values.
