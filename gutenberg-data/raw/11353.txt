Summary = """
This is an academic monograph published as part of the Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science series (Ninth Series, Volume X). Written by J.H.T. McPherson, a Ph.D. and Fellow in History at Johns Hopkins University, the work examines the history of Liberia from its origins through the colonization movement. The book covers the American Colonization Society's efforts to establish Liberia as a colony for freed African Americans, the Maryland colony in Liberia, and the establishment of the Republic of Liberia. McPherson analyzes the historical significance of colonization from multiple perspectives: as a Southern movement toward emancipation, as an effort to suppress the slave trade, as an attempt to civilize Africa, as a missionary endeavor, and as a potential refuge for African Americans facing increasing competition in America. This work represents late 19th-century scholarly perspectives on African colonization and its implications.
