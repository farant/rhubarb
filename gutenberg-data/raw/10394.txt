The year 1907 is indicated by the Roman numerals "MCMVII" at the end of the title page. While Howard Pyle wrote many stories throughout his career that were later collected into various volumes, this particular collection was published in 1907. Pyle was not Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag is not included, though his works were generally wholesome and appropriate for children, making them widely acceptable across denominations.
