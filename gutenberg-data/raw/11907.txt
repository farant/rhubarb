Summary = """
This is an issue of Punch, the famous British weekly magazine of humor and satire that was published from 1841 to 1992. Punch was known for its political satire, cartoons, and humorous commentary on Victorian and later British society. This particular issue from July 12, 1890 (Volume 99) includes the recurring feature "Voces Populi" (Voices of the People), which presented humorous sketches of overheard conversations in various public settings. In this case, the scene is set at a Military Exhibition, capturing the dialogue of ordinary Londoners attending the event. Punch was enormously influential in British culture and is credited with coining many phrases and establishing the conventions of political cartooning.

Notes = """
The year 1890 is the publication date of this specific issue. Punch magazine was a periodical, so each issue has its own distinct publication date. "Various" is used for the author since Punch was a collaborative effort with multiple contributors, though specific pieces may have had individual authors (often writing under pseudonyms). The magazine was generally family-friendly for Victorian standards, hence the "appropriate-for-children" tag.
