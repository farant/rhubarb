I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

This is clearly a periodical publication - "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction" from October 24, 1829. This was a popular Victorian-era magazine that published miscellaneous articles, illustrations, and educational content. The text shows Volume XIV, Number 395.

Since this is a periodical rather than a single-authored work, and the specific article shown is about the Royal Exchange contributed anonymously ("From a Correspondent"), I'll provide information about the periodical itself:

Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical published from 1822 to 1849. It featured illustrated articles on history, science, literature, art, and general knowledge, aimed at educating and entertaining middle-class Victorian readers. Each issue contained miscellaneous essays, engravings, poetry, and educational content. This particular issue from October 1829 includes an article on the history of London's Royal Exchange, describing how Sir Thomas Gresham established it in 1566-1571 after his father Sir Richard Gresham's earlier failed attempt in 1534.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1829 reflects the actual publication date of this specific issue (October 24, 1829). As a periodical with multiple contributors, this represents the collective work of various writers rather than a single author. The Mirror was known for making knowledge accessible to general readers during the early Victorian period.
