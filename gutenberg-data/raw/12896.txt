Summary = """
A collection of four essays on aesthetic philosophy and literary criticism by American author and poet George Henry Calvert (1803-1889). The work contains essays examining fundamental questions of aesthetics and poetics: "The Beautiful" explores philosophical concepts of beauty, "What Is Poetry?" investigates the nature and definition of poetry, "Style" discusses literary style and composition, and "Dante and His Latest Translators" provides critical analysis of Dante's work and contemporary translations. Calvert was a scholar of German literature and philosophy, and these essays reflect 19th-century American engagement with European aesthetic thought. The work represents the kind of elevated literary criticism common to educated American literati of the mid-to-late 19th century.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1875 is taken directly from the publication date shown in the text itself. George Henry Calvert was not a Catholic author - he was from a prominent Maryland family but his work here is secular literary and aesthetic criticism rather than religious in nature, so the 'catholic' tag is not applicable.
