Summary = """
'Cap and Gown' is an anthology of college verse compiled by Frederic Lawrence Knowles in 1897. The collection focuses on light, humorous poetry celebrating undergraduate life - themes of youth, joy, and love from a student's perspective. Knowles, who also edited 'The Golden Treasury of American Songs and Lyrics,' dedicated this work to Francis James Child, the renowned Harvard scholar and collector of English and Scottish ballads. The prefatory note makes clear that these verses are not meant to be taken too seriously - they don't aspire to epic or heroic poetry, but rather capture the spirit and experiences of college life in late 19th century America.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1897 is straightforward as it appears on the title page. Francis James Child (1825-1896), to whom this is dedicated, was the distinguished Harvard professor famous for his collection 'The English and Scottish Popular Ballads.' The dedication's past tense ('whom I was once proud to call my friend') suggests Child had recently died when this was published, which aligns with the 1897 publication date.
