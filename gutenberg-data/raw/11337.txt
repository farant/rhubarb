Summary = """
A Western adventure novel set in the Wyoming cattle ranges during the late 19th century era of conflict between established cattlemen and cattle rustlers. Edward S. Ellis (1840-1916) was an extremely prolific American author who wrote hundreds of dime novels and adventure stories, primarily aimed at young readers. He was one of the most popular authors of juvenile fiction in the late 1800s, known for his Western, frontier, and adventure tales. This work follows the typical Ellis formula of action-packed storytelling with moral lessons suitable for young audiences.
