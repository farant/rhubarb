Notes = """
1905 is the original publication year of this work. While Linnankoski was a Lutheran Finn (not Catholic), the novel deals with moral and spiritual themes, though it would not qualify for the 'catholic' tag as specified in your criteria. The work has been adapted multiple times for film and theater in Scandinavia.
