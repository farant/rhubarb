Summary = """
An Essay on the Trial by Jury is a legal and political treatise by American anarchist and abolitionist Lysander Spooner. The work argues extensively for the doctrine of jury nullification - the right and duty of juries to judge not only the facts of a case but also the justice of the law itself. Spooner contends that trial by jury was historically intended as a protection against governmental tyranny and unjust laws. The essay is part of Spooner's broader constitutional philosophy that challenged the legitimacy of governmental authority and defended individual liberty. It became an influential work in libertarian and anarchist thought, as well as in discussions of jury rights and legal philosophy.

Notes = """
First published in 1852. Spooner was not Catholic - he was a religious skeptic and political anarchist, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply. The work is significant in American legal and political philosophy, particularly in libertarian circles.
