A treatise on electoral reform written by two Australian authors - T.R. Ashworth, who was President of the Victorian Division of the Australian Free Trade and Liberal Association, and H.P.C. Ashworth, a civil engineer. The work examines principles of political representation, critiques existing electoral systems, and proposes reforms including proportional representation methods such as the Hare system and preferential voting. Published during a period of significant electoral reform debate in the British Empire and particularly relevant to Australia, which was federated the same year.
