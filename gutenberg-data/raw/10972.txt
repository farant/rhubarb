Summary = """
A firsthand military account by Colonel John Ward, C.B., C.M.G., M.P., of the British military expedition to Siberia during the Russian Civil War (1918-1920). Ward commanded battalions of the Middlesex Regiment (the 'Die-Hards') during the Allied intervention in Siberia following the Russian Revolution. The work documents military operations, political complexities, and the chaotic situation in Russia during this period. Originally written as a personal narrative for his sons in case he did not return, it provides valuable primary source material on the Allied intervention in Russia and the tumultuous post-WWI period in Siberia.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1920 is the publication year stated in the text itself. This is a contemporary account written shortly after the events described (the Siberian intervention of 1918-1920), making it a valuable primary historical source rather than a later historical analysis. The author explicitly notes in his forward that he wrote of events as they occurred and recorded motivations in real-time, which gives the work its documentary value despite what he acknowledges as limitations in historical perspective.
