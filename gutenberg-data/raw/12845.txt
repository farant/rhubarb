Notes = """
The World's Greatest Books series was first published around 1910 and became quite popular in the English-speaking world. While exact publication dates can vary by edition, 1910 is the commonly cited date for the initial publication of this compilation series. This is an editorial anthology rather than an original historical work, and therefore the year reflects when the compilation was published, not the original dates of the individual works it contains.
