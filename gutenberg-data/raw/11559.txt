Author = "John Addington Symonds"
Year = 1877

Tags = ["non-fiction", "art-history", "renaissance-studies"]

Summary = """
This is the third volume of John Addington Symonds' monumental seven-volume work "Renaissance in Italy" (1875-1886), focusing specifically on the fine arts. Rather than providing a comprehensive history of Italian art, Symonds examines how the visual arts relate to the broader cultural movement of the Renaissance. The work analyzes painting, sculpture, and architecture in the context of the intellectual, social, and spiritual transformations that defined the Italian Renaissance period. Symonds was a Victorian scholar and cultural historian known for his groundbreaking work on Renaissance culture and his studies of Greek and Italian literature.
"""

Notes = """
The complete "Renaissance in Italy" series was published between 1875-1886. "The Fine Arts" volume was originally published in 1877. This 1899 edition by Smith, Elder & Co. is a later printing. I've chosen 1877 as the most historically significant date for cataloging purposes, as it represents when this particular volume first appeared and contributed to Renaissance scholarship. The work is not tagged as 'catholic' as Symonds, while deeply learned in Italian culture and sympathetic to Catholic artistic achievements, was not himself Catholic and approached the material from a secular Victorian scholarly perspective.
