Summary = """
Volume Four of Theodore Roosevelt's comprehensive historical work on American westward expansion. This volume covers the critical period from 1791 to 1807, documenting the United States Government's wars against Northwestern Indian tribes, the rise of Western political power in the Union, and the acquisition and exploration of territories beyond the Mississippi River. Roosevelt chronicles General Wayne's campaigns in the north, frontier conflicts in Tennessee and Georgia, the establishment of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio as states, and the creation of Louisiana, Indiana, and Mississippi territories. The work examines how this era of rapid territorial expansion and population growth transformed the American West from frontier to a powerful force in national politics, culminating in the first sustained peace along the border in fifty years.
