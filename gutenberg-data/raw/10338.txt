Summary = """
'With the Turks in Palestine' is a firsthand account by Alexander Aaronsohn of life in Palestine during World War I under Ottoman Turkish rule. Aaronsohn was a Palestinian Jew who witnessed the hardships, military conscription, and German-Turkish military operations in the region. The book provides valuable historical documentation of the conditions faced by the local population during the war, including forced labor, famine, and the oppressive policies of the Ottoman authorities led by Djemal Pasha. The work is part of the broader historical narrative of the collapse of Ottoman rule in the Middle East and the events leading to the British conquest of Palestine. The dedication to his mother 'who lived and fought and died for a regenerated Palestine' hints at the personal tragedy and hope for Jewish national revival that permeates the narrative.

Notes = """
The year 1916 is when this work was originally published, as indicated on the title page. This was during WWI while the events described were still unfolding. Alexander Aaronsohn was the brother of Aaron Aaronsohn, the famous agronomist and leader of the NILI spy network that worked for the British against the Ottomans. The town 'Zicron-Jacob' (Zikhron Ya'akov) was a Jewish agricultural settlement in Palestine founded in 1882.
