Summary = """
This is a section from the Catalog of Copyright Entries published by the United States Copyright Office. Specifically, it covers renewal registrations - the legal filings made to extend copyright protection on works originally registered approximately 28 years earlier (in this case, works from around 1931-1932 being renewed in 1959). The catalog served as the official public record of copyright registrations and renewals in the United States. Entries are organized alphabetically by author or title and include details about both the original registration and the renewal claim. This particular excerpt begins with entries under 'A', including works by authors Abbott and others.
"""

Notes = """
The page reference '1959_h2/A/1623' and the renewal dates (mostly Dec59, Jul59) indicate this volume was published in 1959. The Catalog of Copyright Entries has been published since 1891 and serves as an important historical record for determining copyright status of older works. This is a government publication and was itself in the public domain upon publication.
