Summary = """
This is a scholarly article/monograph by Robert D'Awans, a professor at the Royal Athenaeum of Malines (Mechelen), presented to a learned society on April 26, 1901. The work examines the furnishings and interior of the Hôtel de Pitsembourg (a Commandery) in the middle of the 17th century, based on archival inventories from the State Archives in Antwerp dating from 1656, 1664, 1676, and 1677. The author provides a detailed analysis of the furniture, artwork, and objects that decorated this important historical building in Malines (Mechelen), Belgium. The Commandery of Pitsembourg was a religious-military establishment, and the inventories reveal the lifestyle and material culture of its commanders during the 17th century.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1901 represents the publication date of this scholarly work, which is when it was presented and published. The subject matter concerns 17th-century furnishings, but the work itself is a historical study from the turn of the 20th century. This is a work of historical scholarship rather than a primary historical document, so 1901 is the appropriate date.
