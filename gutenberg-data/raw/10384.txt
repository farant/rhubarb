I recognize this work as "Le Pays de l'Or" (The Land of Gold) by Henri Conscience, a Flemish-Belgian author who wrote extensively in both Dutch and French. This appears to be a novel set during the 1849 California Gold Rush period, as evidenced by the date mentioned in the opening and the reference to finding gold nuggets. Henri Conscience (1812-1883) was one of the most important Flemish authors of the 19th century, though he was not a Catholic author in the sense of writing religious or devotional works, despite being from a Catholic cultural background.

Based on the opening, this is a fictional adventure/historical novel about a young clerk dreaming of fortune during the Gold Rush era. The work was likely published in the mid-to-late 19th century, probably around the 1850s-1860s given the topical nature of the Gold Rush setting.

Notes = """
The novel was likely published around 1862, though exact publication dates for some of Conscience's French-language works can be difficult to pinpoint. The story is set explicitly in May 1849, during the height of Gold Rush fever. While Conscience came from a Catholic Flemish background, his novels were primarily historical and adventure fiction rather than religious works, so this does not receive a 'catholic' tag.
