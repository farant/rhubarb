Summary = """
This is an economic and political history reference work examining the ship subsidy systems of maritime nations worldwide. The book provides a comparative analysis of how different countries (Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, the United States, and others) have used government subsidies to support their merchant marine fleets. Written during a period when maritime trade policy was a significant political issue, it serves as a factual compilation of laws, regulations, and historical development of these systems rather than an advocacy piece.
