Summary = """
Tartarin de Tarascon is a comedic novel by French author Alphonse Daudet, the first in a trilogy featuring the lovable braggart Tartarin. The story satirizes the boastful character of Provençal southerners through its protagonist, a rotund bourgeois from the small town of Tarascon who fancies himself a great hunter and adventurer. Despite never having left his garden, Tartarin sets off on a lion-hunting expedition to Algeria, leading to a series of absurd misadventures. The novel gently mocks both French provincial life and the romanticized notion of exotic adventure that was popular in 19th century literature.
