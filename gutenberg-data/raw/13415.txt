Summary = """
This is volume 3 of Constance Garnett's landmark English translation of Chekhov's short stories. The title story, "The Lady with the Dog" (Дама с собачкой), is considered one of the greatest short stories ever written. It tells of a cynical married man who begins an affair with a young woman at a seaside resort, only to find himself unexpectedly falling into genuine love. The collection also includes other notable late Chekhov stories such as "The Black Monk" (a psychological tale of a scholar haunted by a phantom monk), "Ionitch" (about a doctor's spiritual decline in provincial life), and "An Anonymous Story" (a longer novella about a revolutionary who infiltrates a household as a servant).
