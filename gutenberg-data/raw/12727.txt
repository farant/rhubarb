Summary = """
Le Nabab is a novel by French author Alphonse Daudet, published in 1877. The story follows Bernard Jansoulet, a self-made man who has amassed enormous wealth in Tunisia (hence "le nabab" - the nabob) and returns to Paris seeking social acceptance and political power. The novel is a sharp satire of Second Empire society, depicting the corruption, materialism, and moral decay of Parisian high society. The character of Jansoulet was partly inspired by the real-life figure François Bravay, a wealthy adventurer of the period. The work is considered one of Daudet's major novels and offers a critical portrait of the era's nouveaux riches and the aristocratic circles that both courted and despised them.
