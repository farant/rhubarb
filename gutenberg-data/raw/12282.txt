Summary = """
A work of biblical criticism and theology by R. Heber Newton, an Episcopal clergyman and prominent liberal Protestant theologian of the late 19th century. The book addresses how to properly understand and interpret Scripture in light of modern biblical scholarship and critical methods. Newton was part of the broader movement of liberal Christianity that sought to reconcile traditional faith with historical-critical approaches to the Bible. The work is divided into seven chapters examining both misconceptions about the Bible ('The Unreal Bible') and proper methods for critical, historical, ethical, and spiritual engagement with Scripture.
"""

Notes = """
The copyright date of 1883 is clearly stated in the text, indicating original publication. R. Heber Newton was an Episcopal priest, not a Catholic author, and his liberal Protestant biblical criticism would not have received Catholic imprimatur. The work represents 19th century Protestant modernism's attempt to address challenges posed by biblical criticism while maintaining religious faith.
