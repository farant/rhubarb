Notes = """
The year 1901 is taken from the publication information shown on the title page (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York 1901). This represents the American edition. Quiller-Couch (1863-1944) was a prolific writer and later became a prominent literary critic and professor at Cambridge University. His works are generally appropriate for older children and young adults, featuring adventure and mild supernatural elements rather than explicit content.
