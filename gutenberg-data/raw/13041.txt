Summary = """
Vildanden (The Wild Duck) is one of Henrik Ibsen's most celebrated plays and a masterpiece of Norwegian dramatic literature. The play explores themes of self-deception, the danger of idealism, and the lies families tell themselves to survive. The story centers on the Ekdal family - photographer Hjalmar, his wife Gina, and their daughter Hedvig - whose fragile domestic peace is shattered when Gregers Werle arrives determined to expose long-buried truths. The wild duck of the title is a wounded bird kept in the Ekdal attic, serving as a powerful symbol of damaged lives and the human capacity for adaptation. The play is considered a turning point in Ibsen's work, moving toward a more nuanced, tragicomic view of human nature.
