Notes = """
The original publication date was around 1852, though this appears to be an 1890 edition/printing. Julia Pardoe (1806-1862) wrote this three-volume biography in the mid-19th century as part of her series on French royalty. The year 1852 represents the original publication of this work, which became one of the standard English-language biographies of Marie de' Medici during the Victorian era.
