Summary = """
This is the eighth book in the Camp Fire Girls series by Hildegard G. Frey, officially endorsed by the Camp Fire Girls organization. The Camp Fire Girls was a youth organization founded in 1910 to provide outdoor activities and character development for girls, similar to the Boy Scouts. This particular volume was published during World War I, and the title reflects the patriotic themes of the era - "Do Their Bit" was a common phrase for home front war efforts, while "Over the Top" was military slang for going into battle from the trenches. The Winnebagos are the name of the particular Camp Fire Girls group featured in this series. The book follows the adventures and character development of the girls as they contribute to the war effort on the home front.
"""

Notes = """
The 1919 publication date is clearly stated in the book's copyright page. This was published during the final year of WWI and reflects the patriotic fervor of the era. The Camp Fire Girls organization was a real, non-denominational youth organization, so this does not qualify for the 'catholic' tag despite being wholesome period literature.
