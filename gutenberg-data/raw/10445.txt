This is a collection of essays published by the Boone and Crockett Club, an organization founded by Theodore Roosevelt in 1887 to promote conservation and ethical hunting practices. The book contains contributions from prominent hunters and naturalists of the early 20th century, including Roosevelt himself. Topics include wilderness preservation, the zoology of North American big game, detailed accounts of hunting expeditions in Alaska (particularly bear and moose hunting), and essays on specific species like the Kadiak bear and mountain sheep. The Boone and Crockett Club played a significant role in early American conservation efforts and the establishment of national parks and wildlife refuges.
