Summary = """
This is a collection of poems and biographical sketches of poets from Cecil County, Maryland, compiled and edited by George Johnston, who also authored a history of Cecil County. The anthology was published to honor the memory of David Scott, a late School Commissioner, and was initiated by teachers and pupils from public schools in the northeastern part of Cecil County. It represents a regional literary anthology documenting the poetic output of a specific Maryland county during the 19th century.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1887 is straightforward as this is when the work was published and copyrighted. This is an original compilation by Johnston, not a translation or edition of earlier works. The work reflects the late 19th-century American tradition of regional literary anthologies celebrating local culture and history.
