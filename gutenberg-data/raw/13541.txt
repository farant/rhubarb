Summary = """
This is Volume 1 of the collected works of Ambrose Bierce, the American journalist, short story writer, and satirist known as "Bitter Bierce." This volume contains a mix of satirical fiction and autobiographical essays. "Ashes of the Beacon" is a satirical piece imagining a future historian looking back at the fall of American civilization. "The Land Beyond the Blow" is a Swiftian satirical travelogue with fantastical lands critiquing human society. The "Bits of Autobiography" section contains valuable firsthand accounts of Bierce's experiences as a Union soldier in the American Civil War, including the battles of Shiloh, Chickamauga, and Pickett's Mill, making these historically significant primary sources.
"""

Notes = """
1909 is the original publication year of this collected edition, published by Neale Publishing Company. While some individual pieces were written earlier (the Civil War memoirs describe events from 1861-1865), this collected volume first appeared in 1909. Bierce famously disappeared in Mexico in 1913-1914 and was never seen again.
