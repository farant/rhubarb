Summary = """
"Probable Sons" is a Christian children's novel by Amy Le Feuvre, a British author known for her moralistic fiction with evangelical Protestant themes. The story appears to involve themes of redemption and the influence of children on adults, as suggested by the biblical quotations used as epigraphs: "A little child shall lead them" (Isaiah 11:6) and references to the Prodigal Son parable. Le Feuvre's works typically featured young protagonists who, through their innocent faith and moral example, lead others (often wayward or hardened adults) to Christian conversion and better behavior. Her books were extremely popular in late Victorian and Edwardian England among religious families.

Notes = """
The year 1896 is clearly stated on the title page as the publication date. Amy Le Feuvre was a Protestant (not Catholic) author, so the 'catholic' tag is not applicable despite the Christian religious content.
