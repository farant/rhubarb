Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly magazine published from 1822 to 1849. It was one of the earliest cheap periodicals aimed at a mass audience, featuring a mix of articles on literature, science, history, travel, and current events. This particular issue from March 1831 features content about the Swan River Colony in Western Australia, which had been established in 1829 as Britain's first free settler colony in Australia. The magazine was known for its engravings and accessible style.

Notes = """
Year is the actual publication date of this periodical issue (March 12, 1831), not the founding date of the magazine (1822). Since this is a periodical rather than a standalone work, the issue date is most historically accurate.
