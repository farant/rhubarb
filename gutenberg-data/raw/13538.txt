Summary = """
Punch was a British weekly satirical magazine founded in 1841, renowned for coining the term 'cartoon' in its modern sense. This volume from 1891 contains typical Punch fare: humorous essays, satirical commentary on Victorian society, political cartoons, and light fiction. The excerpt shown is from 'Some Circular Notes,' a travel narrative following the author through Reims, France, written in the observational comic style characteristic of Victorian travel writing. The magazine was influential in British culture and its archives provide valuable insight into Victorian and Edwardian attitudes and humor.

Notes = """
Year is 1891 as this is a periodical published that year. Punch had many contributors over its history; individual articles were often anonymous or pseudonymous. Not marked 'appropriate-for-children' as Victorian satire often contained adult themes and political content, though not inappropriate per se. Not marked 'catholic' as Punch was a secular British publication that sometimes took an anti-Catholic editorial stance typical of 19th century British protestantism.
