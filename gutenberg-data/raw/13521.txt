Summary = """
Notes and Queries was a weekly periodical founded in 1849 by William John Thoms. It served as a correspondence forum for scholars, antiquaries, literary researchers, and curious readers to pose questions and share answers on matters of history, literature, folklore, etymology, genealogy, and general curiosities. The motto "When found, make a note of" comes from Captain Cuttle in Dickens' Dombey and Son. This particular issue (No. 9, December 29, 1849) contains articles on subjects ranging from Sir Edward Dering's household accounts to Gothic architecture, musical works, and various historical queries. The publication continues to this day and remains an important resource for researchers.
