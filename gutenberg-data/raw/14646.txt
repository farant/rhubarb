Summary = """
Christopher and Columbus is a novel by Elizabeth von Arnim (born Mary Annette Beauchamp, also known as "Elizabeth" from her famous earlier work "Elizabeth and Her German Garden"). The story follows twin sisters Anna-Rose and Anna-Felicitas, young women of mixed German-English parentage who are sent to America during World War I as refugees. The title refers to their self-adopted nicknames as they set out to "discover a New World." The novel is a wartime comedy dealing with themes of identity, displacement, and the difficulties faced by those caught between warring nations. Von Arnim herself had complicated national ties - born in Australia, raised in England, married to a German count - which informed this sympathetic portrayal of the sisters' predicament.
