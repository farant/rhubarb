Summary = """
A Christmas-themed story by William J. Locke, an English novelist popular in the early 20th century. Locke was known for romantic and sentimental fiction with a light touch. This work, subtitled "The Story of Three Wise Men," appears to be a Christmas tale that likely plays on the biblical theme of the Three Wise Men visiting the infant Jesus, reimagined in a contemporary or allegorical setting. The epigraph "I cannot tell how the truth may be: I say the tale as 'twas said to me" suggests a storytelling frame that adds mystery and folklore quality to the narrative.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1910 is clearly marked on the title page as the publication date. This appears to be the original publication year for this specific work. William J. Locke was not a Catholic author - he was English but not known as a Catholic writer, so the 'catholic' tag was not applied.
