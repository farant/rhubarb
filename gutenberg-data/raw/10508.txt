Based on the content, this is clearly "The Sorrows of a Show Girl" by Kenneth McGaffey, published in 1908. The text explicitly states it was originally printed in The Morning Telegraph, New York. This appears to be a serialized fiction work about theatrical life in early 20th century New York (the "Great White Way" refers to Broadway's theater district).
