Summary = """
Punch, or The London Charivari, was Britain's preeminent weekly magazine of humor and satire, published from 1841 to 1992. Known for its political cartoons, witty commentary, and social satire, Punch was an influential voice in Victorian and later British culture. This issue from November 22, 1890 (Volume 99) contains typical Punch content: a political cartoon about actor-manager S.B. Bancroft's charitable donation to General Booth's social relief scheme, humorous observations about a storm's "kindness" in depositing injured sailors at Dover Hospital, and satirical snippets about current events. Punch was essential reading for the educated British middle and upper classes, offering sophisticated humor and pointed social commentary on the events and personalities of the day.

Notes = """
This is a periodical issue, not a standalone book. The year 1890 is straightforward as it's printed on the publication itself. Punch's contributors were typically anonymous or used pseudonyms, hence 'Various' as the author.
