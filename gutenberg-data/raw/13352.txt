Summary = """
Punch was a British weekly magazine of humor and satire published from 1841 to 2002. This issue contains "Mr. Punch's Pocket Ibsen," a series of parodies of Henrik Ibsen's plays written in condensed, comedic form. This particular installment parodies "The Wild Duck" (1884), one of Ibsen's most celebrated works. The parodies were a regular feature mocking the vogue for Ibsen's serious, symbolism-laden dramas that were controversial and fashionable in late Victorian England. The humor derives from reducing Ibsen's complex psychological dramas to absurd, rapid-fire theatrical sketches.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1891 is taken directly from the publication date of this specific issue. While Punch ran for over 160 years, each issue is its own discrete publication. The parody series "Mr. Punch's Pocket Ibsen" reflects the cultural moment when Ibsen's plays were being widely performed and debated in London.
