I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

Based on the title page, this is "Miriam Monfort: A Novel" published by D. Appleton and Company in New York in 1873. The author is identified as "the author of 'The Household of Bouverie.'"

From my knowledge, "Miriam Monfort" was written by Emma Dorothy Eliza Nevitte Southworth (often published as E.D.E.N. Southworth), a prolific American novelist of the 19th century. She was one of the most popular American women writers of her era, known for domestic fiction and melodramatic novels. "The Household of Bouverie" was one of her earlier works.

E.D.E.N. Southworth was not Catholic - she was Protestant, so this work would not qualify for the 'catholic' tag.

Summary = """
'Miriam Monfort' is a domestic novel by E.D.E.N. Southworth, one of the most popular American women writers of the 19th century. Southworth was known for her melodramatic fiction that often featured strong female protagonists facing adversity, family intrigue, and gothic elements. Her novels typically explored themes of virtue, perseverance, and justice within domestic settings. The epigraphs from Browning's 'The Ring and the Book' and the dedication suggest this work deals with memory, judgment, and misfortune. The novel was published during the height of Southworth's career when she was a bestselling author of serialized fiction.

Notes = """
The publication year of 1873 is taken directly from the title page and represents the original publication date by D. Appleton and Company. This work is not appropriate for young children given the typical themes in Southworth's novels (gothic elements, family intrigue, dark themes as suggested by the epigraphs).
