I can identify this work based on the text provided. Let me analyze what we have here:

This is clearly from "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction," which was a Victorian periodical. The specific content is a review/supplementary piece about Sir Walter Scott's novel "Anne of Geierstein, or The Maiden of the Mist."

However, I need to clarify what we're actually cataloging here:
- The **periodical itself** (The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Vol. 13, No. 373)
- Or the **novel being reviewed** (Anne of Geierstein by Sir Walter Scott)

Based on your description that this is "a text from project gutenberg," I believe you're asking about the periodical issue itself, not Scott's novel. The Mirror was published from 1822-1849 in London. Vol. 13, No. 373 would be from around 1829, which aligns with the publication date of "Anne of Geierstein" (1829).
