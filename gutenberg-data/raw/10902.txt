Summary = """
A children's story set at a Sioux Indian mission school in Dakota, following the lives and moral development of young Native American girls like Hannah Straight Tree and Cordelia Running Bird as they navigate their duties, education, and Christian teachings at the boarding school. The book reflects the late 19th-century mission school movement aimed at assimilating Native American children into Euro-American Christian culture. Written with a didactic tone typical of the period, it emphasizes themes of duty, cleanliness, hard work, and Christian morality.
"""

Notes = """
Published circa 1899. This work is part of the Indian mission school literature genre popular in the late 1800s. While well-intentioned for its time, modern readers should approach it with awareness of the historical context of forced assimilation policies and cultural suppression that characterized Indian boarding schools. The book provides historical insight into this period but reflects the paternalistic attitudes of the era.
