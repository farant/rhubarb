Salve Fran. Based on the text you've provided, this is clearly J. Benwell's travel narrative about his experiences in America, published in 1857. The work is a first-hand observational account of life in both free and slave states, with particular attention to the "iniquitous system of slavery."

From what I can determine from the text and the historical context, this appears to be the original publication year (1857), as the author discusses his "four years" of residence on the North American continent and is writing in the midst of the pre-Civil War period when slavery was a major topic of British interest.

Summary = """
A first-hand travel narrative by British author J. Benwell documenting his four years of residence and travel throughout the United States in the 1850s. The work chronicles his journey through New York, Ohio, Missouri, and down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, with particular attention to observing and contrasting life in free states versus slave states. Written during the tumultuous pre-Civil War period, the account provides a British perspective on American society, manners, and most significantly, the institution of slavery, which the author describes as "iniquitous." The work represents an important example of mid-19th century travel literature that captured foreign impressions of America during one of its most divisive historical periods.

Notes = """
1857 appears to be the original publication year based on the title page. This work belongs to a genre of British travel narratives about America that were popular in the Victorian era, often critical of American institutions, particularly slavery. The author's stated regret at not being able to visit Caribbean islands to further document slavery conditions reflects the intense British interest in abolition during this period, coming after Britain's own abolition of slavery in its colonies in the 1830s.
