Summary = """
This is the eighth volume of W. Carew Hazlitt's revised and expanded edition of Robert Dodsley's classic collection of old English plays, originally published in 1744. This fourth edition, published 1874-1876, chronologically arranges and annotates Renaissance and early modern English dramatic works. Volume VIII includes five plays: Thomas Nashe's 'Summer's Last Will and Testament' (1600), 'The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntington', 'The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington', 'Contention between Liberality and Prodigality', and 'Grim the Collier of Croydon'. These are important specimens of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, preserving works that might otherwise have been lost to history. Hazlitt's scholarly edition includes comprehensive notes from previous commentators as well as his own annotations.
"""

Notes = """
I chose 1874 as the publication year for this specific volume, which is when Hazlitt's edition began publication (the full series was published 1874-1876). This is a scholarly collection rather than an original creative work, so the date represents when this important editorial project made these historical plays accessible to Victorian readers and scholars. The plays contained within range from the late 16th to early 17th centuries.
