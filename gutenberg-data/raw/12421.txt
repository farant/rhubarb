Summary = """
A pedagogical workbook designed to accompany Adams Sherman Hill's "Foundations of Rhetoric." The book focuses on teaching correct English usage through practical exercises rather than mere error correction. Buehler, a master of English at the Hotchkiss School, argues that language proficiency comes primarily through imitation and habit formation rather than abstract knowledge. The work critiques the common approach of "sentences to be corrected" exercises, proposing instead methods that more effectively build lasting correct habits of expression.
