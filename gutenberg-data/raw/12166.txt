I can help you identify this work. Based on the title page, this is Volume II of "The Works of John Dryden," which is a collected edition of John Dryden's works edited by Walter Scott.

However, this is a **collection/anthology** rather than an original work by Dryden. The actual works by Dryden contained in this volume (The Wild Gallant, The Rival Ladies, The Indian Queen, etc.) were written in the 1660s-1670s, but this specific **edition** was published in 1808 as indicated on the title page.

For your purposes of creating a historical timeline, I need to clarify: do you want me to catalog this as:
1. The 1808 Walter Scott edition (the physical book itself), or
2. Try to assign metadata for each individual play/work contained within it?

Given that this appears to be Project Gutenberg's digitization of Scott's collected edition, I'll treat this as the 1808 edition itself, since that's what the text represents:

Summary = """
This is the second volume of Walter Scott's influential eighteen-volume collected edition of John Dryden's works, first published in 1808. This edition was groundbreaking for its time, featuring extensive historical, critical, and explanatory notes by Scott, along with a biography of Dryden. Volume II contains several of Dryden's early dramatic works from the 1660s-1670s, including 'The Wild Gallant,' 'The Rival Ladies,' 'The Indian Queen,' 'The Indian Emperor,' and 'Secret Love, or the Maiden Queen,' along with Dryden's original prefaces, dedications, and critical essays such as his 'Defence of an Essay of Dramatic Poesy.' John Dryden (1631-1700) was England's first Poet Laureate and one of the most important literary figures of the Restoration period.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1808 represents the publication date of this collected edition, not the original composition dates of Dryden's plays (which range from approximately 1663-1667). This edition by Walter Scott was historically significant in establishing Dryden's literary reputation in the 19th century.
