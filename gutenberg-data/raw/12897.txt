I need to read through this text to identify the work. Let me examine what we have:

This appears to be an issue of "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction" - a periodical publication from 1829. This is specifically Volume XIII, No. 357, dated Saturday, February 21, 1829.

This is not a single authored book, but rather a periodical magazine that was published regularly in the 19th century. The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly magazine that ran from 1822 to 1849, containing articles on various topics including history, literature, art, and general knowledge.

Notes = """
The year 1829 is the publication date of this specific issue. This is a periodical rather than a single authored work, so "Various" is listed as the author. The magazine was priced at 2 pence per issue, making it affordable for middle-class readers. While individual contributors wrote articles, the magazine itself did not typically credit individual authors by name.
