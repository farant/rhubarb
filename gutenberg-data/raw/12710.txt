Summary = """
Rapunzel is one of the most beloved fairy tales collected by the Brothers Grimm, telling the story of a young girl with impossibly long golden hair who is locked in a tower by an enchantress. The tale involves themes of captivity, love, and eventual liberation when a prince discovers her by following her singing voice. The story has roots in older European folk traditions and has become one of the most recognizable fairy tales in Western culture.
"""

Notes = """
1812 is the year of first publication in the Grimms' 'Kinder- und Hausmärchen' (Children's and Household Tales), first edition. The tale underwent revisions in later editions (notably 1857), but 1812 represents the original scholarly collection of this folk narrative.
