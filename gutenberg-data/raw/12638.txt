Summary = """
This is an academic monograph published as part of the Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science series. The work examines the complex history of public land distribution and agrarian legislation in ancient Rome, including the struggles between patricians and plebeians over land reform, the ager publicus (public land), and the various agrarian laws that were passed throughout the Republic's history. It represents late 19th-century American scholarship on Roman history and would have been used primarily in university settings.
