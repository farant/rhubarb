Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical published in the early 19th century (1822-1849). This particular issue from February 14, 1829 (Volume XIII, No. 356) features a detailed architectural illustration and description of the interior of the Colosseum panorama building in Regent's Park, London. The publication was designed to educate and entertain a general audience with illustrated articles on architecture, history, science, literature, and other topics of popular interest. It was an affordable periodical (priced at 2 pence) that helped democratize knowledge and culture in the pre-Victorian era.
"""

Notes = """
This is a single issue of a weekly periodical, so the year 1829 is straightforward - it's the publication date printed on the issue itself (February 14, 1829). The Colosseum mentioned was a famous panorama building in Regent's Park that opened in 1829, making this a contemporary account of a newly opened attraction. The periodical had no single author but was compiled by various contributors and editors.
