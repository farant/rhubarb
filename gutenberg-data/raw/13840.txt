Summary = """
A historical novel set during the Great Plague of London in 1665. The story follows characters living through the devastating epidemic that killed an estimated 100,000 Londoners. The 'red cross' of the title refers to the mark painted on doors of houses where plague victims resided, warning others to stay away. Everett-Green was known for her morally instructive historical fiction aimed at younger readers, and this work combines adventure with a vivid portrayal of 17th century London under the shadow of pestilence.
"""
