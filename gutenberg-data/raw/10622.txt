Summary = """
This is the third volume of a comprehensive biographical dictionary of English and Irish poets, compiled by Theophilus Cibber (son of the famous actor-manager Colley Cibber) and other contributors. The work draws on manuscript notes from the scholar Thomas Coxeter and various other sources to provide biographical sketches of poets from the Restoration period and early 18th century. This volume includes lives of notable figures such as John Dryden, Aphra Behn, John Denham, and George Etherege, among others. It was one of the earliest attempts at a systematic biographical dictionary of English poets and served as an important precursor to Samuel Johnson's more famous 'Lives of the Poets' (1779-1781).
"""

Notes = """
The publication year is clearly marked as MDCCLIII (1753) on the title page. While there were multiple volumes in this series published around the same time, this volume III bears the 1753 date. The work is not classified as 'appropriate-for-children' as it's a scholarly biographical reference work, nor 'catholic' as it's a general literary biographical collection without specific religious orientation.
