Summary = """
"Melmoth Reconciled" (Melmoth réconcilié) is a novella by Honoré de Balzac that serves as a sequel to Charles Maturin's Gothic novel "Melmoth the Wanderer" (1820). The story follows the cursed Melmoth figure as he appears in Paris, exploring themes of damnation, redemption, and the corrupting power of wealth in modern society. Balzac transplants the Gothic horror tradition into the mundane world of Parisian commerce, particularly focusing on the figure of the cashier—a man perpetually tempted by the wealth he handles but does not own. The work is part of Balzac's larger "La Comédie Humaine" series and reflects his Catholic worldview, dealing with sin, temptation, and the possibility of reconciliation with God.
"""

Notes = """
First published in 1835. Balzac was a Catholic author and while his works often dealt with human vices and the corruption of society, they were written from a moral framework informed by Catholic theology. The work explores explicitly Catholic themes of damnation and redemption. The Ellen Marriage translation was part of the comprehensive English translation of Balzac's works published in the late 19th/early 20th century.
