Summary = """
Punch, or The London Charivari was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire established in 1841. It became a British institution, known for its satirical humor, cartoons, and commentary on politics and society. This issue from June 1919 comes from the immediate post-World War I period, making references to President Wilson, the peace negotiations, and cultural trends like the Jazz boom. The magazine ran until 2002, making it one of the longest-running humor publications in history.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1919 is clearly indicated in the text itself (June 18, 1919). Punch was not a single-author work but rather a collaborative periodical with many contributors over its 161-year run.
