Notes = """
Year is approximate based on Len Spencer's active recording period for Edison Records (roughly 1899-1910). The "Cyclone Auto" references and the Edison National Historic Site provenance suggest this is from the early automobile era, likely 1902-1905. Spencer recorded numerous similar rural comedy sketches during this period.
