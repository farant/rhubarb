Summary = """
An educational anthology of short stories compiled and edited by C. Alphonso Smith, who was the Edgar Allan Poe Professor of English at the University of Virginia. The collection was designed as a teaching tool to help students understand the craft of short story writing through the analysis of exemplary works. The introduction outlines Smith's pedagogical approach, emphasizing the three essential elements of short stories: Setting/Background (when and where), Plot/Plan (what happens), and Characters/Character (who the story is about). The anthology includes classic stories such as Dickens's "A Christmas Carol," Hawthorne's "The Great Stone Face," and Stevenson's "Markheim," among others, selected to illustrate various aspects of the short story form.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1916 is straightforward as it's the publication date of this anthology. C. Alphonso Smith (1864-1924) was a prominent American educator and literary scholar who wrote extensively on the American short story form. This is an educational textbook rather than a primary literary work.
