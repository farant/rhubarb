Summary = """
La Niña de Luzmela is a novel by Spanish author Concha Espina, one of the most celebrated Spanish women writers of the early 20th century. The work is set in rural Spain and tells the story of Carmencita, a young girl being raised by her godfather Don Manuel, a troubled man who experiences strange episodes of frenzied joy followed by deep melancholy. The novel explores themes of family, rural Spanish life, and the complexities of guardianship and affection. Espina was known for her realistic portrayals of Spanish provincial life, particularly in her native Cantabria region, and her sympathetic treatment of women's experiences in traditional Spanish society.
"""

Notes = """
1922 is the publication year stated in the text itself. Concha Espina was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature multiple times and was one of the most important Spanish novelists of her generation. While she was Catholic and her works often reflect Catholic Spanish society, this appears to be a secular literary work rather than explicitly Catholic literature, so I have not included the 'catholic' tag.
