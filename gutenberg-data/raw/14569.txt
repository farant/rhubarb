Summary = """
A memoir-like collection of childhood memories by Finnish author Teuvo Pakkala. The work describes the author's youth in Northern Finland, focusing on the experiences of a poor child around seven years old. The excerpt shows vivid depictions of childhood hunger and poverty, but also the carefree joy of playing with other boys. Pakkala was known for his realistic and sympathetic portrayals of working-class Finnish life, particularly childhood.
"""

Notes = """
The 1921 date comes directly from the publication information in the text (Otava, Helsinki, 1921). Pakkala wrote several works about childhood memories and experiences in the late 19th/early 20th century. This appears to be a later edition or collection of his reminiscences.
