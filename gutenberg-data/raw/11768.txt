I'll analyze this text from Project Gutenberg to identify the work, author, and publication details.

Based on the content, this is clearly a collection of miscellaneous works by Samuel Johnson (Dr. Johnson), published in 1825 as part of a nine-volume collected works edition. The volume contains various pieces including his famous works on the English dictionary, Shakespeare, and the Harleian library.

Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) was one of the most important figures in 18th-century English literature. However, this particular volume is a posthumous collection published in 1825, well after his death.

For the year, I need to consider: this is a compilation published in 1825 (as shown by "MDCCCXXV"), but the individual works were written much earlier - primarily in the 1750s-1760s. The most famous pieces here (the Dictionary prefaces and Shakespeare preface) date from 1755 and 1765 respectively. Since this is a collected edition rather than original publications, and the use case is for a historical timeline, I'll use 1825 as it represents when this particular compilation was published, though I'll note the original composition dates.

Notes = """
Year chosen is 1825, the publication date of this collected edition (indicated by "MDCCCXXV"). The individual works were originally composed much earlier: the Dictionary materials date from 1747-1773, the Shakespeare preface from 1765, and the Harleian library pieces from the 1740s-1750s. Since this is a posthumous collected edition rather than original publications, 1825 represents when this particular compilation was made available to readers.
