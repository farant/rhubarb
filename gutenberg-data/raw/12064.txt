I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

From the text, I can see this is "Notes of an Overland Journey Through France and Egypt to Bombay" by Emma Roberts, published in 1841. Emma Roberts was a British travel writer and poet who traveled extensively in India and wrote about her experiences. This particular work documents her journey from England to India via the overland route through France and Egypt, which was a popular route before the Suez Canal.

Emma Roberts (1794-1840) was known for her vivid travel writing and contributions to periodicals. She died in India in 1840, which is why this work is noted as being "by the late Miss Emma Roberts" and was published posthumously in 1841 with a memoir.
