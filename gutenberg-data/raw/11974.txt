I need to analyze this text to identify the work and provide the requested information in TOML format.

This is clearly from "Dialstone Lane" by W.W. Jacobs, as stated in the header. W.W. Jacobs (William Wymark Jacobs) was a popular English humorist and short story writer, best known for "The Monkey's Paw." This appears to be Part IV, Chapter XIV of the novel.

Let me provide the structured information:
