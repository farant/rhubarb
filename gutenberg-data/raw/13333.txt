Title = "Correspondence & Conversations of Alexis de Tocqueville with Nassau William Senior from 1834 to 1859, Volume II"
Author = "Nassau William Senior, Alexis de Tocqueville"
Year = 1872

Tags = ["non-fiction", "historical-document"]

Summary = """
This is the second volume of collected correspondence and recorded conversations between two prominent 19th-century intellectuals: Alexis de Tocqueville, the famous French political thinker and author of "Democracy in America," and Nassau William Senior, a British economist and Poor Law reformer. The work documents their discussions spanning 25 years (1834-1859), covering major political events in France including the 1848 revolution, Louis Napoleon's coup d'état of 1851, and the establishment of the Second Empire. The conversations provide firsthand observations on French politics, socialism, Bonapartism, and European affairs from two keen political observers. M.C.M. Simpson edited the work for publication after both men had died.
"""

Notes = """
Year 1872 chosen as this is when the correspondence was first compiled and published. The conversations themselves span 1834-1859, but they were private exchanges not intended for publication during the participants' lifetimes. Tocqueville died in 1859 and Senior in 1864. The editorial work by Simpson to bring these materials to public light in 1872 represents the historically significant publication event.
