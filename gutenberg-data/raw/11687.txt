Notes = """
The year 1859 is taken directly from the publication date shown in the magazine header. As a periodical, this represents a collection of articles by various authors rather than a single-author work. The Atlantic Monthly was an important cultural institution in 19th-century America, featuring contributions from writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. This issue would have been published monthly as part of Volume III of the magazine's run.
