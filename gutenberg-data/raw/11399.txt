Summary = """
This work by Colonel John Biddulph examines the early history of English trade and presence in India, focusing particularly on the period before the mid-eighteenth century wars with France. The book details the significant dangers and hardships faced by early English traders in India, including piracy (particularly from the Malabar coast), treacherous sea voyages, hostile environments, and the general challenges of establishing and maintaining commercial operations in India during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The work also includes an account of an Englishwoman's experiences in India two hundred years prior to publication. Biddulph aims to give proper recognition to these early traders and adventurers whose efforts established the foundation for British presence in India, arguing that their contributions have been underappreciated in historical accounts that typically focus on later military conflicts.
