Summary = """
Baccara is a novel by Hector Malot, the prolific French novelist best known for "Sans Famille" (Nobody's Boy). The novel is set in Elbeuf, a textile manufacturing town in Normandy along the Seine, and the opening passage beautifully describes the industrial history of the town centered around the small Puchot river. Malot was known for his realistic depictions of French society, particularly the lives of working people and provincial life. This work continues his tradition of social realism, examining the textile industry and the people whose lives revolve around it.

Notes = """
The year 1886 appears directly in the text header, which corresponds to the original French publication date. Hector Malot (1830-1907) was a prolific French author who wrote over 70 novels. While he was likely nominally Catholic as most French of his era, his works are secular realist fiction rather than Catholic literature, hence the omission of that tag.
