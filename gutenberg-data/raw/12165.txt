Summary = """
A collection of seven lectures on theosophy and spiritual development by Finnish theosophist Pekka Ervast. The lectures were delivered in 1913 (six in Helsinki in autumn, one at the Theosophical Society's annual meeting in summer) and published in 1914. The work covers practical esoteric psychology and spiritual development, including topics such as preparation for initiation, the nature of God, moral and intellectual purification, supersensible life, rebirth in Christ, and independent practice of yoga. Ervast emphasizes that "secret science" (salatiede) is practical psychology dealing with humanity's deepest spiritual and religious experiences, not to be confused with "secret sciences" (salaiset tieteet).
