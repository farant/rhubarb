Summary = """
A concise history of New York City written for general readers, particularly young people. Charles Hemstreet (1866-1938) was an American author who specialized in accessible histories of New York. This book traces Manhattan's development from its earliest days through the turn of the 20th century, using a narrative storytelling approach rather than dry academic prose. The book was illustrated with historical prints and engravings, and included a table of events for easy reference. Hemstreet deliberately minimized dates in the main text to keep the narrative flowing smoothly.
