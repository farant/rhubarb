Summary = """
The Malefactor is a novel by E. Phillips Oppenheim, a prolific British author known as the "Prince of Storytellers" who specialized in thriller and espionage fiction. This novel follows themes typical of Oppenheim's work - intrigue, society scandals, and moral complexity. The story involves a man returning to society after some disgrace or criminal past (suggested by the title "The Malefactor" and chapter titles like "Outside the Pale" and "Hast Thou Found Me, O Mine Enemy?"). The narrative appears to span from England to America, dealing with themes of redemption, revenge, and romantic entanglement among the upper classes.
