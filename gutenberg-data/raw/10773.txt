I'll help you identify this text and extract the relevant information. Let me analyze what you've provided.

Based on the text, this is clearly "Ancient and Modern Physics" by Thomas E. Willson. This appears to be an early 20th-century work that attempts to reconcile Eastern metaphysical concepts (particularly Theosophical teachings) with Western physics. The work was originally published in serial form in *The Theosophical Forum* around 1900-1901, as evidenced by the preface noting Willson's death in March 1901 while the final chapter was being prepared for the April 1901 issue.

The book represents an attempt to bridge ancient esoteric knowledge with modern scientific understanding, a common theme in Theosophical literature of that era. Thomas E. Willson was an American Theosophist who contributed regularly to Theosophical publications.
