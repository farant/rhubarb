Notes = """
H. Irving Hancock (1868-1922) was a prolific American author of juvenile adventure fiction. The "Young Engineers" series was published in the 1910s, with this Mexico volume appearing around 1913. This was during a turbulent period in Mexican history (the Mexican Revolution), though such books typically featured romanticized adventure rather than historical accuracy. The year 1913 is based on the typical publication timeline of Hancock's series works and the Project Gutenberg book number (12778) which correlates with works from this era.
