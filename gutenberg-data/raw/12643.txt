The collection gathers verses from her earlier works 'I Pose' and 'This is the End' (both published by Macmillan), as well as poems that appeared in periodicals including the Athenaeum, Everyman, and the Pall Mall Gazette. Benson notes in her preface that the title has no reference to her age. Stella Benson was a modernist writer known for her experimental fiction and poetry, and this collection represents her early poetic work during the World War I era.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1918 is clearly stated on the title page and represents the original publication date of this collection. Stella Benson was actually 26 years old at the time of publication, hence her clarification that the title 'Twenty' does not refer to her age - it may refer to the number of poems or simply be an artistic choice.
