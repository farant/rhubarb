Summary = """
Mimmi Paavaliina is a four-act comedy play by Finnish author Maiju Lassila, the pen name of Algot Untola. The play centers on the character Mimmi Paavaliina, an unmarried woman (neitsyt/maiden) who nonetheless has six children of various ages. This comedic premise drives the rural Finnish humor typical of Lassila's work. The play features a cast of colorful village characters including farmers, a dean (rovasti), a parish clerk (lukkari), and young people, set in a Finnish peasant household. Lassila was known for his humorous depictions of Finnish rural life and common people.
