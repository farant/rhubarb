Summary = """
This is an anti-slavery tract (No. 18 in a series) published by the American Anti-Slavery Society documenting the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 and its effects. The law, authored primarily by Senator James Mason of Virginia and signed by President Millard Fillmore, required citizens to assist in the capture of escaped slaves and denied fugitives the right to a jury trial. The tract provides a synopsis of the law's provisions and likely catalogs cases of individuals affected by its enforcement. It was part of the abolitionist movement's effort to expose the law's injustices and galvanize opposition to slavery in the years leading up to the Civil War.
"""

Notes = """
