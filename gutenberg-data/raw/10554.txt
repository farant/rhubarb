Summary = """
Right Ho, Jeeves is one of P.G. Wodehouse's most beloved comic novels featuring the inimitable gentleman's gentleman Jeeves and his hapless employer Bertie Wooster. The plot involves Bertie's well-intentioned but disastrous attempts to sort out the romantic entanglements of his friends without Jeeves's guidance, including the love affairs of Gussie Fink-Nottle (a newt-fancying acquaintance) and Madeline Bassett, as well as complications involving Tuppy Glossop and Angela Travers. The novel showcases Wodehouse's mastery of comic plotting, memorable characters, and his distinctive prose style full of literary allusions and inventive metaphors. It is widely considered one of the finest examples of English comic writing and represents Wodehouse at the peak of his creative powers.
