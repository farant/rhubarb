Notes = """
The 1872 date shown is a later edition. The book was first published in 1857. Oliver Optic was the pen name of William Taylor Adams (1822-1897), a Boston schoolteacher who became enormously popular writing adventure stories for boys. The dedication to Charles Henry Pope and the moralizing preface are typical of his style.
