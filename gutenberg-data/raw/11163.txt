Summary = """
Potterism is a satirical novel by Rose Macaulay, a prominent English novelist and essayist. The book is a social satire that coined the term "Potterism" to describe a particular kind of intellectual laziness, sentimentality, and muddled thinking that Macaulay saw as prevalent in post-World War I British society. The story follows the Potter family, whose patriarch runs a sensationalist newspaper empire, and explores themes of journalism ethics, truth versus comfortable illusion, and the tension between clear thinking and popular sentiment. It was well-received as a sharp critique of British middle-class values and media culture of the era.
