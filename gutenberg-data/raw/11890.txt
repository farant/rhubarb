Summary = """
A boys' adventure novel from the early 20th century, part of the juvenile fiction series published under the Frank V. Webster pseudonym by the Stratemeyer Syndicate. The book follows young protagonists on adventures in the American West, likely involving frontier life, cowboys, and the kind of wholesome adventure stories that were popular for young male readers in the Progressive Era. The title references the "Rough Riders," invoking the romanticized image of Theodore Roosevelt's volunteer cavalry unit from the Spanish-American War, which had captured American imagination in this period.
