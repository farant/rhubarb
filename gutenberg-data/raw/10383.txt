Dr. Thomas Bull, a physician specializing in midwifery and diseases of women and children, provides practical advice on managing children's health and treating common childhood ailments. The book was part of the domestic medical advice literature that emerged in the 19th century as physicians sought to educate mothers on proper childcare practices.
