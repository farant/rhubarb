I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

Looking at the text, this is clearly "The Vigil of Venus and Other Poems" by "Q" (the pen name of Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch), published in 1912. The book includes his translation/adaptation of the "Pervigilium Veneris" (an ancient Latin poem) along with other original poems and a drama.

The "Pervigilium Veneris" itself is an anonymous late Roman poem (likely 2nd-4th century CE), but this 1912 publication is Q's literary work featuring his English version alongside other original compositions. Since this is presented as Q's collection rather than simply a translation, 1912 is the appropriate year.

Summary = """
This collection by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (writing as "Q") features his English rendition of the Pervigilium Veneris (The Vigil of Venus), a celebrated late Roman Latin poem of unknown authorship celebrating the festival of Venus. The original Pervigilium Veneris, likely composed between the 2nd-4th century CE, is a lyrical celebration of spring, love, and renewal with the famous refrain about singing and loving. Q's 1912 volume also includes his original works: a one-act drama titled "The Regent" and various poems including Exmoor Verses and folk songs. Quiller-Couch was a prominent English writer, literary critic, and professor at Cambridge University, known for his literary taste and editorial work on the Oxford Book of English Verse.
"""

Notes = """
While the Pervigilium Veneris dates to late antiquity (2nd-4th century CE), the year 1912 reflects this specific publication as Q's literary work. This is appropriate since the volume is presented as a collection "by Q" rather than merely a translation, and includes substantial original material alongside the Vigil of Venus adaptation.
