Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly magazine published from 1822 to 1849. It was one of the earliest cheap periodicals aimed at a mass audience, featuring miscellaneous articles on literature, history, travel, science, and current events. This particular issue (Vol. XIV, No. 387) from August 29, 1829 features an article about Constantinople with an engraving, discussing the city's geography, architecture, and strategic importance during a period when the Russo-Turkish War and potential "expulsion of the Turks from Europe" were current topics.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1829 is taken directly from the publication date shown in the text. This is a periodical rather than a single-author work, hence "Various" for the author. The magazine was founded by John Limbird and was notable for being sold at the low price of 2 pence, making literature and knowledge accessible to the working class.
