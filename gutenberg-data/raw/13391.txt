Summary = """
Punch was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire established in 1841. It was one of the most influential and celebrated satirical publications in history, running until 1992 (with a brief revival 1996-2002). The magazine featured cartoons, humorous articles, parodies, and social commentary. This issue from June 1891 includes "Voces Populi" (Voices of the People), a recurring feature presenting comedic sketches of everyday Victorian life. The excerpt shown depicts a hapless curate being pressed into service to narrate a magic lantern show of "Valentine and Orson" at a children's party - a classic Punch scenario of social awkwardness among the English middle class.
"""

Notes = """
Punch was published weekly, so 1891 is the precise publication year. The magazine had no single author - it employed many writers and illustrators over its 150+ year run. Famous contributors included John Tenniel (Alice in Wonderland illustrator), Douglas Jerrold, and later A.A. Milne. "Charivari" refers to a French satirical magazine that inspired Punch's founding.
