I recognize this work from the title page and author information provided. Let me analyze what I can determine:

This is "Essays in Rebellion" by Henry W. Nevinson (full name: Henry Woodd Nevinson), a British journalist, war correspondent, and social activist. Based on the list of his other works mentioned (particularly "The New Spirit in India" from 1907-1908 and "Essays in Freedom" which preceded this), and my knowledge of his publishing history, "Essays in Rebellion" was published in 1913.

Nevinson was known for his progressive political writings, campaigning against slavery (as evidenced by "A Modern Slavery"), and his coverage of various revolutionary movements. This collection of essays would have dealt with themes of social justice, liberty, and reform from a progressive but not explicitly Catholic perspective.
