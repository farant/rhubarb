Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly magazine published from 1822 to 1849. It was one of the first cheap periodicals aimed at a mass audience, costing only twopence. The magazine featured a diverse mix of content including essays, biographical sketches, historical narratives, poetry, extracts from new books, scientific discoveries, and domestic advice. Volume 20 would have been published in 1832-1833. The periodical was founded by John Limbird and was notable for making literature and knowledge accessible to working-class readers during the early Victorian era.
"""

Notes = """
The Mirror of Literature ran from 1822-1849. Volume 20 corresponds to the year 1832 based on the publication schedule of roughly one volume per year. This is a periodical compilation rather than a single-author work, hence "Various" for the author field.
