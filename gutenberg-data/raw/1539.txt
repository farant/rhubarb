Summary = """
The Winter's Tale is one of Shakespeare's late romances, blending tragedy and comedy. The play tells the story of King Leontes of Sicilia, who becomes consumed by irrational jealousy, convinced his wife Hermione is having an affair with his childhood friend Polixenes, King of Bohemia. His paranoid accusations lead to the apparent death of Hermione, the actual death of their young son Mamillius, and the abandonment of their infant daughter Perdita. The second half of the play jumps forward sixteen years to a pastoral setting in Bohemia, where Perdita has been raised by shepherds and falls in love with Polixenes' son Florizel. The play concludes with reconciliation, forgiveness, and one of Shakespeare's most famous theatrical moments: the apparent resurrection of Hermione from a statue.
