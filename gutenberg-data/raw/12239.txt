Summary = """
'Dead Men's Money' is a mystery novel by J.S. Fletcher, one of the most popular British detective fiction writers of the early 20th century. Fletcher was known for his intricate plots and was particularly admired by President Woodrow Wilson. This novel follows the classic mystery structure of the era, involving murder, investigation, and the pursuit of hidden wealth or inheritance. The chapter titles suggest a story involving a mysterious death (possibly of someone named John Phillips), an investigation with various clues (brass-bound chest, parish registers, salmon gaff, ice ax), and multiple witnesses and suspects. Fletcher's work bridges the gap between the Victorian sensation novel and the Golden Age of Detective Fiction.

Notes = """
1920 is the original publication year. J.S. Fletcher (Joseph Smith Fletcher, 1863-1935) was extraordinarily prolific, writing over 230 books. He was particularly influential in the development of British detective fiction, though he is less remembered today than some of his contemporaries like Agatha Christie. The novel is appropriate for children in the sense that it follows the conventions of detective fiction of its era, which typically avoided graphic violence or adult content.
