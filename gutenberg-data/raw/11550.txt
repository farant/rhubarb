Notes = """
The publication date of March 1968 is stated in the text itself. This is a straightforward instructional sports manual rather than a literary or historical work. Not included 'appropriate-for-children' tag as it's a technical sports manual aimed at players of the sport, though it contains no inappropriate content.
