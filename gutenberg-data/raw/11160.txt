Based on the title page, this is clearly **"A Cotswold Village"** by **J. Arthur Gibbs**. This is a well-known work of English rural literature from the late Victorian period. The book is a collection of observations and essays about country life in the Cotswolds region of Gloucestershire, England. It was originally published in **1898**.

The work is non-fiction, describing rural English life, hunting, farming, and the social world of a Cotswold village at the end of the 19th century. It's written in an accessible, anecdotal style. J. Arthur Gibbs was himself a country gentleman who lived in the Cotswolds, and the book reflects his personal experiences and observations. Sadly, Gibbs died young in 1899, shortly after the book's publication, which has added to its poignancy and historical value as a snapshot of a vanishing way of life.
