Summary = """
"A Man and His Money" is an early 20th-century novel by Frederic S. Isham, an American author known for popular romantic adventure fiction. Isham wrote several novels in the early 1900s including "Under the Rose" and "Half a Chance." This work appears to be a story that begins in a run-down music shop and likely follows themes common to Isham's work: adventure, romance, and characters navigating social circumstances. The novel was illustrated by Max J. Spero and represents the kind of popular fiction that was widely read in the pre-World War I era.
