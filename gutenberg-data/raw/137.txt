Summary = """
Sara Crewe is a children's novella by Frances Hodgson Burnett, first published in 1888. It tells the story of Sara Crewe, a wealthy young girl sent from India to a London boarding school run by the stern Miss Minchin. When her father dies and leaves her penniless, Sara goes from being a pampered pupil to a servant in the school's attic. The story follows her resilience, kindness, and imagination through hardship. This novella was later expanded into the full-length novel "A Little Princess" (1905), which is the more widely known version today.
"""

Notes = """
The original novella was published in 1888 in St. Nicholas Magazine and then as a book. Burnett later expanded it significantly into "A Little Princess" in 1905. The year 1888 reflects the original publication of this specific shorter work.
