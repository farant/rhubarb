Po-no-kah is a historical fiction tale by Mary Mapes Dodge set during the pioneer era of American westward expansion.

The narrative explores the trials and dangers faced by early American settlers in the Western territories during the 18th century, including the constant threat of Indian attacks and the challenges of carving out a home in the wilderness. Dodge, best known for her classic "Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates," was a prominent children's author and the founding editor of St. Nicholas Magazine.
