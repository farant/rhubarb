Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical published in London during the early 19th century (1822-1849). It featured illustrated articles on a wide variety of topics including literature, history, biography, natural history, architecture, and general knowledge. This issue from August 8, 1829 includes an article about Voltaire's Chateau at Ferney, discussing the famous French philosopher's residence near Geneva where he lived for twenty years until his death in 1778. The magazine was known for its wood engravings and accessible writing style, making knowledge and culture available to a broader middle-class readership.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1829 is straightforward as this is the actual publication date of this specific issue. "The Mirror" was a weekly publication, and while individual issues had various contributors, they were typically published anonymously or pseudonymously, hence "Various" for the author field. The periodical was edited by John Timbs and others during its run.
