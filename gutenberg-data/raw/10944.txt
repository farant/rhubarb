Summary = """
A collection of short stories by American journalist and author Samuel Hopkins Adams, set in a New York City neighborhood referred to as "Our Square." The stories are character sketches and vignettes depicting the lives of ordinary people in an urban community, told from the perspective of an observer on a park bench. Adams was known for his muckraking journalism and popular fiction, and this work represents his more gentle, humanistic storytelling about everyday American life in the early 20th century.
