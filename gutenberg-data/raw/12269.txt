Summary = """
'Wee Macgreegor Enlists' is a novel by Scottish author J.J. Bell, part of his popular series about the character Wee Macgreegor (MacGregor), a Glasgow boy whose adventures were told in Scottish dialect. This installment, published during World War I, follows MacGregor as he enlists in the military. The book captures the home front experience and the transition from civilian to military life during the Great War, written with Bell's characteristic humor and warmth. The series was extremely popular in Scotland and gave readers a glimpse into working-class Glasgow life through dialect fiction. The chapter titles suggest a romantic subplot alongside the military storyline.
"""

Notes = """
1916 is the clear publication year for this edition. J.J. Bell's Wee Macgreegor series began earlier (the first book was published in 1902), but this specific war-time installment was published in 1916 during World War I, making it both a work of fiction and a period piece reflecting contemporary events.
