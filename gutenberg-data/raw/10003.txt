Summary = """
This is a memoir by Mary King Waddington, an American woman who married French statesman William Henry Waddington. The book chronicles her experiences as the wife of a prominent French politician during the crucial early years of the Third French Republic (1876-1879). During this period, her husband served as Minister of Public Instruction, Foreign Minister, and briefly as Prime Minister of France. The memoir provides valuable first-hand accounts of French political life, the Berlin Congress of 1878, the Paris Exposition of 1878, and the social circles surrounding the French government during a pivotal period of republican consolidation after the fall of the Second Empire. It offers unique insights into Franco-American relations and the role of women in diplomatic society during the Belle Époque era.

Notes = """
The year 1914 is the publication date of this memoir, which is clearly stated on the title page. While the events described take place between 1876-1879, the work itself is a retrospective account written and published in 1914. Since this is the author's own memoir rather than a historical work about earlier events, 1914 is the appropriate date. Mary King Waddington (1833-1923) was born in New York and became a notable figure in French diplomatic circles through her marriage.
