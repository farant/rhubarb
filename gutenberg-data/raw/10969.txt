Summary = """
'Ski-Running' is an instructional manual on skiing technique written by \
Katharine Furse, a prominent British public servant who held the honors \
of Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (G.B.E.) and the \
Royal Red Cross (R.R.C.). Published in 1924, the book aims to fill a \
niche between existing comprehensive skiing manuals by authors like \
Vivien Caulfeild and Arnold Lunn. Furse's work is particularly aimed at \
beginners and intermediate skiers, drawing on her extensive experience \
coaching novices. The book contains practical advice on skiing technique, \
with illustrations from photographs and a map. Writing from the perspective \
of someone who learned the sport later in life, Furse offers accessible \
instruction while acknowledging the physical challenges that age presents \
to mastering advanced techniques like the Christiania turn in difficult \
conditions.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1924 is clearly stated on the title page and represents the \
original publication date of this work. This was during the early period \
of recreational skiing's popularization in Britain and represents an \
important historical document in the development of skiing instruction \
literature in English.
