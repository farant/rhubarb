Summary = """
The Lair of the White Worm is a horror novel by Bram Stoker, published in 1911 near the end of his life. It tells the story of Adam Salton, who is invited by his grand-uncle to visit England. There he becomes entangled with Lady Arabella March, who is revealed to be an ancient supernatural creature - a monstrous white worm that dwells in a subterranean lair. The novel combines elements of folklore, Victorian Gothic horror, and psychological thriller as Adam and his allies attempt to destroy the creature. This was Stoker's final novel, published a year before his death, and is considered one of his more eccentric and experimental works, less polished than Dracula but still displaying his fascination with ancient evil and supernatural horror.
"""

Notes = """
The text clearly indicates this was transcribed from the 1911 W. Foulsham & Co. Ltd. edition, which matches the original publication year. This is one of Bram Stoker's lesser-known works compared to Dracula (1897), but historically significant as his last completed novel before his death in 1912. Not tagged as appropriate-for-children due to horror themes. Not tagged as catholic - while Stoker was born into a Protestant Irish family, this is Gothic horror fiction rather than explicitly religious literature.
