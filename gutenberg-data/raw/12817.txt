Summary = """
This is a biography of the Victorian poet Robert Browning written by Edward Dowden, Professor of English Literature at the University of Dublin. The work is part of "The Temple Biographies" series edited by Dugald Macfadyen. Dowden focuses on what he calls "a biography of the mind" (borrowing Gladstone's phrase), examining Browning's intellectual and spiritual development through his poetry rather than simply recounting external events. The biography associates Browning's poems with their dates and origins to illuminate his inward development. Browning (1812-1889) was one of the most important Victorian poets, known for his dramatic monologues and philosophical optimism. This biography appeared in 1904, fifteen years after Browning's death, during a period of growing scholarly interest in his work.
"""

Notes = """
The publication year of 1904 is clearly stated on the title page. This is a critical biography written after Browning's death in 1889, part of the scholarly apparatus that established Browning as a major Victorian literary figure. The work emphasizes Browning's role as an "authoritative interpreter of the spiritual factors in human life" and his "tonic optimism," reflecting the Edwardian era's view of Victorian poetry.
