Summary = """
Dew Drops was a weekly Christian children's magazine published by David C. Cook Publishing Company of Elgin, Illinois. It contained short stories, poems, and moral lessons aimed at young readers. This particular issue from April 19, 1914 includes the story "A Syrup-Can Mother" by Mary Gilbert, about children Dorothy and Laurence Deane receiving a surprise in their father's dinner pail. David C. Cook Publishing was (and still is) a Christian publisher, making this a religious children's periodical typical of early 20th century Sunday school literature.
"""

Notes = """
This is a periodical rather than a standalone book. The year 1914 is the publication date of this specific issue. David C. Cook Publishing Company was founded in 1875 and specialized in Sunday school materials. While clearly Christian in orientation, I would not mark it 'catholic' as David C. Cook was a Protestant (Methodist) publisher focused on evangelical Sunday school literature.
