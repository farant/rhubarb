"The Claim Jumpers" is an adventure romance novel by American author Stewart Edward White, set in the American West during the mining frontier era. The story follows Bennington, a young man from the East who travels west and becomes involved in the rough-and-tumble world of mining claims, encountering both danger and romance.
