Summary = """
A novel by Canadian author Isabel Ecclestone Mackay (1875-1928), who was a popular poet and novelist in the early 20th century. The book appears to be a pastoral narrative, suggested by the opening scene of a traveler on a country road encountering a small boy near a swimming pool. The dedication to the author's mother and the cheerful tone suggest this may be a wholesome story of rural life or a journey narrative. Mackay was known for her accessible, optimistic writing style that often celebrated nature and simple pleasures.
"""

Notes = """
Isabel Ecclestone Mackay was a prominent Canadian literary figure who wrote both poetry and prose. This novel appears to have been published during World War I, though its pastoral setting suggests an escape from contemporary troubles. The year 1917 is based on publication records for this work, though exact dating can vary between Canadian and American editions.
