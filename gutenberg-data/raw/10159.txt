I'll analyze this text from Project Gutenberg to identify the work and provide the requested information.

This is clearly "England and the War" by Walter Raleigh (not the Elizabethan explorer, but the Oxford professor of English literature, 1861-1922). The book is a collection of addresses delivered during World War I and was published in 1918 in Oxford, as stated on the title page.

Summary = """
A collection of wartime addresses by Walter Raleigh (1861-1922), the Oxford \
Professor of English Literature, delivered during World War I. The work \
contains six pieces written between 1914 and 1918, including 'Might is Right,' \
'The War of Ideas,' 'The Faith of England,' 'Some Gains of the War,' 'The War \
and the Press,' and 'Shakespeare and England' (his British Academy Shakespeare \
Lecture). These addresses represent intellectual and cultural commentary on \
Britain's role and ideals during the Great War, exploring themes of national \
character, patriotism, and England's cultural heritage in wartime. Raleigh was \
a prominent literary scholar and critic, knighted in 1911, who served on \
various wartime committees and later became the official historian of the Royal \
Air Force before his death in 1922.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1918 is unambiguous as it appears on the title page and represents \
when these previously delivered addresses were first collected into book form. \
The individual addresses span 1914-1918, making this a primary historical \
document from World War I. Not tagged as 'catholic' as Walter Raleigh was \
Anglican/Protestant, not Catholic.
