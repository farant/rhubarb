"""

Notes = """
The publication date of August 11, 1832 is clearly stated in the masthead. This is a periodical publication with multiple contributors rather than a single author, hence 'Various' as the author. The Mirror was one of several popular illustrated periodicals of the era that made literature and learning accessible to middle-class Victorian readers.
