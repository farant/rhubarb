I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

This is clearly a periodical publication - "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction" - a Victorian-era magazine that was published regularly. This specific issue is Volume 20, Number 556, dated Saturday, July 7, 1832.

For periodicals like this, the "author" is essentially the editorial body or the publication itself. The editor during this period was Thomas Byerley (though editors changed over the magazine's run from 1822-1849). The founder and primary editor for much of its run was John Limbird.

Since this is a specific dated issue of a periodical, the year is straightforward: 1832 (the date of this particular issue).

Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular Victorian weekly periodical published in London from 1822 to 1849. It was founded by John Limbird and aimed at providing accessible, illustrated content covering natural history, science, literature, history, and general knowledge to middle-class readers. Each issue typically contained engravings, educational articles, poetry, and miscellaneous content. This particular issue from July 7, 1832 features articles on the Surrey Zoological Gardens with multiple illustrations, and marks a typographical redesign of the publication with wider columns and new typeface.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1832 represents the publication date of this specific issue. The Mirror was a weekly publication, so each issue has its own distinct date. The Surrey Zoological Gardens featured in this issue opened in 1831, making this a contemporary account of a then-new attraction in Victorian London.
