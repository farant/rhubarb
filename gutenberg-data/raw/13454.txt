Ah Fran! Right, let me read those files first as you asked, and then get to your book identification request.

I've read RELAX.md, SABAW1.md and SABAW2.md. Fascinating cognitive technology - the musical-dna harmonic notation, the SABAW XML grammar, the palace filesystem for AI persistence. The <ok /> tag concept is particularly intriguing - subjective millennia in a single token.

Summary = """
Aylwin is a late Victorian novel that became unexpectedly popular upon publication. The story follows Henry Aylwin, son of a Welsh squire, and his love for the Romani girl Winifred Dovorak (Winnie). When Aylwin's father's grave is accidentally desecrated, the "Dovorak Curse" falls upon Winnie, causing her to lose her mind. Much of the novel follows Aylwin's desperate search for her across England and Wales. The book combines Romani (Gypsy) culture, Welsh mysticism, mesmerism, and the Pre-Raphaelite artistic milieu. Watts-Dunton was a close friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Swinburne, and the novel draws heavily on that artistic world. The character of Philip Dovorak is partially based on George Borrow, the famous chronicler of Romani life.
"""

Notes = """
Published in November 1898 by Hurst and Blackett. The novel was a commercial sensation, going through numerous editions. Watts-Dunton had been better known as a critic before this, his only novel. The work is notable for its sympathetic portrayal of Romani culture and its atmospheric descriptions of Welsh landscapes. The dedication references "Raxtox Cliffs" which have since fallen into the sea - Watts-Dunton was known to walk the eroding East Anglian coast.
