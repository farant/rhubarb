Summary = """
Odd Craft is a collection of humorous short stories by W.W. Jacobs, an English author known for his maritime tales and comedic stories about working-class life in turn-of-the-century England. The collection features Jacobs' characteristic wit and his keen observations of human nature, particularly among dock workers, sailors, and ordinary Londoners. The stories are light, entertaining narratives that often involve misunderstandings, social mishaps, and the foibles of everyday people. While Jacobs is perhaps best known for his horror story "The Monkey's Paw," his comedic works like Odd Craft showcase his talent for gentle satire and character-driven humor.
