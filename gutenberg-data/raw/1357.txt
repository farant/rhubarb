Summary = """
Madame Firmiani is a short story (nouvelle) by Honoré de Balzac, part of his massive interconnected work La Comédie humaine. The story explores Parisian society through the figure of Madame Firmiani, a woman whose reputation is variously interpreted by different social circles. Balzac uses this device to examine how gossip, prejudice, and social position shape perception. The narrative centers on a young man, Octave de Camps, and his relationship with the mysterious widow. It is considered one of Balzac's "Scènes de la vie parisienne" (Scenes of Parisian Life) and demonstrates his characteristic interest in the interplay between social appearances and inner moral reality.
"""

Notes = """
First published in 1832 in the Revue de Paris. The dedication to Alexandre de Berny references the son of Laure de Berny, who was Balzac's older lover and mentor. This is a relatively brief work within Balzac's oeuvre but exemplifies his technique of presenting a character through multiple perspectives and social lenses.
