Notes = """
Year chosen is 1922, which is the recording date mentioned in the metadata. While the song may have been published/composed slightly earlier, the 1922 recording date represents the historical artifact that Project Gutenberg is actually preserving. This is an audio recording (MP3 format) rather than a traditional text, making it an unusual Project Gutenberg entry.
