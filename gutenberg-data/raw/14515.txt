A medical treatise on childhood nervousness and behavioral issues by Dr. Hector Charles Cameron, a physician at Guy's Hospital in London. The book addresses the psychological and physical aspects of nervous conditions in children, offering guidance to parents and caregivers. Cameron was a respected pediatrician of his era, and this work reflects early 20th century understanding of child psychology and development. The Emerson epigraph about respecting the child's solitude suggests a relatively progressive approach for its time.
