Summary = """
This is a Dutch scholarly monograph examining Hugo Grotius (Hugo de Groot, 1583-1645) and his legal philosophy. Grotius was one of the most important Dutch scholars of the Golden Age, known primarily for his groundbreaking work "De Jure Belli ac Pacis" (On the Law of War and Peace), which laid the foundations for international law. Dr. H. Bertens' study, dedicated to Dr. G.W.J.M. van Zinnicq Bergmann, explores Grotius' contributions to jurisprudence and philosophy. The introduction mentions Grotius' fame in the Netherlands, recounting the famous story of his escape from Loevestein Castle in a book chest with the help of his wife Maria van Reigersberg and their servant Elsje van Houweninghe. Bertens emphasizes that while Grotius was accomplished in theology, philosophy, history, and statesmanship, his immortal fame rests on his legal and philosophical work, particularly "De Jure Belli et Pacis."

Notes = """
The year 1907 is clearly stated as the publication date of this edition in Tilburg. This work was published in the context of renewed Dutch interest in their Golden Age heritage during the early 20th century. The book appears to have been published by a Catholic publisher, and given the author's doctorate and the formal dedication, this represents serious academic scholarship on Grotius' legal philosophy.
