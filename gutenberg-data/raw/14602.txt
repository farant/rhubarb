Summary = """
War Brides is a one-act anti-war play that became famous during World War I. The play depicts women who refuse to bear children destined to become soldiers, presenting a powerful pacifist and feminist message. It was notably performed by the acclaimed actress Alla Nazimova, and was later adapted into a 1916 silent film also starring Nazimova. The play was controversial for its time, addressing themes of women's bodily autonomy and resistance to war through the refusal of motherhood as a form of protest.
