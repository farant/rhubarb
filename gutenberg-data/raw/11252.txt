Summary = """
Martin Hewitt, Investigator is a collection of detective short stories featuring the private investigator Martin Hewitt. Arthur Morrison created Hewitt as a deliberate contrast to Sherlock Holmes - where Holmes was eccentric and bohemian, Hewitt is described as ordinary-looking and methodical. The stories follow the classic Victorian detective fiction format, with Hewitt solving various mysteries including robberies, disappearances, and cases involving valuable objects. The collection was originally published in The Strand Magazine, the same publication that serialized the Sherlock Holmes stories, and represents one of the most successful attempts to create a rival detective character during the golden age of detective fiction.
