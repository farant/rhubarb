Summary = """
"Bataille de Dames" (Battle of Ladies) is a popular French comedy of manners written collaboratively by Eugène Scribe and Ernest Legouvé. The play exemplifies the comédie-vaudeville style that Scribe helped develop and popularize during the 19th century. This particular edition was prepared as an educational text for English-speaking students learning French, complete with introduction, notes, and vocabulary by Professor Benjamin W. Wells. The play represents the lighter dramatic tradition of French theater, focusing on wit, intrigue, and social comedy rather than heavy moral instruction. Scribe was one of the most prolific and commercially successful French playwrights of his era, and this collaboration with Legouvé became a standard text in French language instruction.
