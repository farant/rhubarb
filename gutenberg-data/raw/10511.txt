Summary = """
'A Rogue by Compulsion' is an early 20th-century British adventure thriller by Victor Bridges.

Set against the backdrop of secret service operations, the story involves espionage, escape, and intrigue typical of pre-WWI British adventure fiction.

Notes = """
The publication year of 1915 is clearly stated on the title page. This was published during World War I, when spy fiction and secret service stories were particularly popular in Britain. The book includes illustrations by John H. Cassel and was dedicated to Hughes Massie, who was likely Bridges' literary agent.
