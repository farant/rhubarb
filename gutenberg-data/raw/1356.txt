Author = "Frank T. Bullen"
Year = 1898

Tags = ["non-fiction", "adventure", "maritime"]

Summary = """
A first-hand account of life aboard a South Sea whaling vessel, written from the perspective of a common seaman rather than a ship's officer or scientist. Bullen served as first mate on whaling voyages and provides a vivid description of the methods, dangers, and daily experiences of sperm whale hunting. The book was notable for being one of the first accessible accounts of whaling life aimed at general readers, as opposed to the scientific treatises that preceded it. It became quite popular and helped establish Bullen's literary career as a writer of sea stories.
