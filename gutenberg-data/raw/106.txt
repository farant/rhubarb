'Jungle Tales of Tarzan' is a collection of twelve short stories featuring Tarzan in his youth, before he left the jungle and encountered civilization. Published in 1919, these tales explore Tarzan's formative years among the great apes, his first romantic feelings, encounters with witch doctors, battles with jungle predators, and his developing understanding of the world around him.
