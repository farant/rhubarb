I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

This is clearly "The Twilight of the Gods and Other Tales" by Richard Garnett. Richard Garnett (1835-1906) was a British author, librarian, and scholar who worked at the British Museum. This collection of satirical and fantastical tales was first published in 1888, with an expanded edition in 1903 (as indicated by the MDCCCCIII - Roman numerals for 1903 - on the title page).

The work is a collection of ironic, mythological tales that often critique religious and philosophical themes through fantasy and allegory. Garnett was known for his wit and erudition, and these stories blend classical mythology, Eastern folklore, and medieval legend with Victorian skepticism.

Summary = """
A collection of satirical and fantastical tales by Richard Garnett, British author and librarian at the British Museum. The stories blend classical mythology, Eastern folklore, and medieval legends with Victorian wit and irony. Tales include mythological figures like Ananda, philosophical allegories, and reimagined legends such as Duke Virgil and Alexander the Ratcatcher. Garnett's work is characterized by erudite humor, skepticism toward religious dogma, and creative reinterpretations of traditional narratives. The collection showcases his vast knowledge of world literature and mythology while employing a sophisticated, often subversive narrative style.

Notes = """
This appears to be the 1903 expanded edition (indicated by MDCCCCIII on the title page). The work was originally published in 1888, but the 1903 edition is the more complete version and is the one being used here. Garnett's work, while learned and mythologically sophisticated, often takes an ironic or skeptical stance toward religious themes, so this would not be considered Catholic literature despite dealing with religious subjects.
