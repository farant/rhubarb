Summary = """
A verse novel written in classical hexameters, telling the story of Claude, a young English intellectual traveling in Italy during the Roman Republic uprising of 1849. The poem explores themes of doubt, indecision, romantic hesitation, and the difficulty of authentic action in the modern world. Claude encounters the Trevellyn family and develops feelings for Mary, but his over-analytical nature and constant self-questioning prevent him from acting decisively. The work is notable for its psychological depth, its epistolary structure (letters home), and its wry, ironic treatment of the educated Victorian's paralysis before both love and political engagement. Often considered a precursor to modernist interior monologue.
