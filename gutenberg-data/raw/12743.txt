Summary = """
'The Author's Craft' is a critical essay by Arnold Bennett on the art and technique of fiction writing. Bennett, a prolific English novelist and critic, explores the methods, principles, and challenges of literary composition in this work. Drawing on his own extensive experience as a novelist, he discusses topics such as narrative technique, character development, plot construction, and the relationship between author and reader. The book serves as both a reflection on the creative process and a practical guide for aspiring writers, offering insights into Bennett's own approach to crafting fiction.
"""

Notes = """
First published in 1914. This is a work of literary criticism and craft rather than fiction. Arnold Bennett was not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply. While Bennett was a significant figure in English literature and wrote accessible prose, this is a technical/critical work aimed at writers and serious readers rather than children.
