Summary = """
This is Robert Knox's famous account of his nearly twenty years of captivity on the island of Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka). Knox, an English sea captain, was captured along with his father and other crew members in 1660 when their ship, the Anne, was forced to seek repairs on the island. They were detained by the Kandyan king Rajasinghe II. Knox's father died in captivity, but Robert eventually escaped in 1679 and made his way to the Dutch-controlled coast. His detailed account provides one of the most comprehensive European descriptions of 17th-century Sinhalese society, including its geography, customs, religion, agriculture, and political structure. The work was highly influential and was later used by Daniel Defoe as a source for Robinson Crusoe.
