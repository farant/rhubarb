Summary = """
A Victorian novel by Scottish author James Maclaren Cobban (1849-1903). The work appears to be a psychological or supernatural thriller involving mysterious cases and a physician character. The dedication to Z. Mennell, described as representing "the most humane and most exacting of all professions," suggests the medical profession plays a central role. The chapter titles hint at elements of mystery, the supernatural ("An Apparition And a Confession"), and romance ("Contains a Love Interlude"). Cobban was known for his psychological fiction and this novel explores themes of human will and destiny, as suggested by the title.
