"""

Notes = """
The year 1910 is indicated by the Roman numerals "MCMX" on the title page. This is an anthology/reference work rather than an original creative work, so the year reflects when this collection was published, not when the individual works it discusses were written. The works summarized within span from the 18th century (Defoe, Day) through the 19th century (Dickens, Daudet).
