Summary = """
Punch was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire established in 1841. It became a British institution, famous for its wit, social commentary, and iconic cartoons. This issue from Volume 100 contains the regular feature "Voces Populi" (Voices of the People), a satirical sketch depicting scenes from everyday British life - in this case, the conversations and behaviors of patrons at a London music hall. The piece gently mocks the middle-class audience members who attend such entertainment venues more for social purposes than for the show itself.
