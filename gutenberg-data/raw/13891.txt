This is a volume from James D. Richardson's monumental compilation of presidential documents, specifically covering Theodore Roosevelt's administration.

This particular volume covers Roosevelt's presidency beginning September 14, 1901 (when he assumed office after McKinley's assassination) through the end of the Fifty-seventh Congress's First Session. The work became a standard reference for American political history and presidential communications.
