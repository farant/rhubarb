Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical published in the 19th century (1822-1849). It featured illustrated articles on architecture, literature, history, science, and general knowledge aimed at middle-class Victorian readers. This particular issue from April 7, 1832 includes an article describing the newly completed Lowther Arcade in London's Strand, a covered shopping arcade designed in the Grecian Corinthian style by builder Mr. Herbert. The magazine served as an accessible source of education and entertainment for a broad readership during the Victorian era.

Notes = """
The year 1832 is taken directly from the publication date shown in the header. This is a periodical rather than a single-author work, so 'Various' is appropriate for the author field. The Mirror was known for its engravings and accessible writing style, making it suitable for family readership including older children, though it was primarily aimed at adults.
