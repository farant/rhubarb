Summary = """
A satirical pamphlet written as a mock defense by prostitutes and procuresses against an earlier publication called "The Fifteen Comforts of Whoring." Part of the tradition of early 18th century English satirical and bawdy literature, these pamphlets used irony and humor to comment on sexual mores of the period. The work purports to be written from the perspective of "Ladies of Pleasure" defending their profession against attacks.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1706 is taken directly from the title page ("Printed in the Year, 1706"). The author is anonymous, as was common for publications of this nature at the time. This is NOT appropriate for children and would definitely not receive any Catholic imprimatur - it's bawdy satirical literature from Augustan-era England.
