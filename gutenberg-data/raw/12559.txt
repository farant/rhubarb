Summary = """
'The Automobile Girls at Washington' is part of the popular 'Automobile Girls' series written by Laura Dent Crane in the early 1910s. This installment follows a group of young women who travel to Washington D.C., where they become entangled in a mystery involving foreign spies and international intrigue. The series was part of the early automobile adventure genre that capitalized on the novelty and excitement of motor car travel in the early 20th century. These books combined travel adventure with mystery elements and were marketed primarily to young female readers, offering them adventurous heroines at a time when such representations were relatively uncommon in children's literature. The Washington setting allows for encounters at notable locations including the White House and the Chinese Embassy, as suggested by the chapter titles.
