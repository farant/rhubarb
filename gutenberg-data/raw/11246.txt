The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical published in the early 19th century. It contained a variety of content including essays on architecture, art, literature, science, history, and general knowledge, often accompanied by engravings. This particular issue from October 1829 features an article about Lord Grosvenor's Picture Gallery in Park Lane, London, describing the architectural features of the gallery designed by Mr. Cundy in the Corinthian order, and noting the Earl's patronage of fine arts.

The year 1829 is taken directly from the masthead of this specific issue (Vol. 14, No. 394, Saturday, October 17, 1829). The Mirror was published from 1822 to 1849, making it a significant source for understanding Victorian-era cultural interests and knowledge dissemination.
