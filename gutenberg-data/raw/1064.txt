Summary = """
A classic Gothic horror short story by Edgar Allan Poe, first published in Graham's Magazine in 1842. The tale follows Prince Prospero who attempts to escape a devastating plague called the "Red Death" by sheltering himself and a thousand nobles in his secluded abbey. They indulge in elaborate festivities, including a masquerade ball in seven colored rooms, believing themselves safe from the disease ravaging the world outside. The story is renowned for its vivid imagery, allegorical symbolism (often interpreted as representing the inevitability of death), and its exploration of themes including mortality, hubris, and the futility of trying to escape fate. It is one of Poe's most famous works and a cornerstone of American Gothic literature.

Notes = """
Year chosen is 1842, when the story was first published in Graham's Magazine (May 1842 issue). The story is not appropriate for young children due to its dark themes and graphic descriptions of plague and death, though it is commonly read by teenagers in literature courses. Not tagged as 'appropriate-for-children' or 'catholic' - Poe was not Catholic and the work contains no specifically Catholic themes.
