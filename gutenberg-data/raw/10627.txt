"Beacon Lights of History" is a multi-volume series by John Lord (1810-1894), an American historian and popular lecturer.

The series examines influential leaders, thinkers, and cultural movements, presenting them as pivotal points ("beacon lights") in the development of civilization.

"""

Notes = """
The "Beacon Lights of History" series was published in multiple volumes beginning in the 1880s. Volume VIII was first published around 1883-1884 as part of the complete series. Lord was a prominent American lecturer during the 19th century who delivered his historical lectures across the United States before compiling them into book form. The work reflects Victorian-era historical writing with its focus on "great men" as drivers of historical progress.
