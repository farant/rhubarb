Summary = """
"Contes d'Amérique" (Tales of America) is a collection of short stories by French author Louis Mullem, published in Paris in 1890. The work is dedicated to Alphonse Daudet, the renowned French novelist. According to the author's note, these stories are meant to be considered as "chimeras susceptible of becoming real or of having been so" - suggesting imaginative tales that blur the line between fiction and reality. The collection includes various narratives set in or relating to America, written in French. The opening story "Une Nouvelle École" (A New School) appears to involve characters discussing a meeting at someone's residence, with dialogue suggesting a social or literary gathering.
"""

Notes = """
The publication date of 1890 is clearly stated in Roman numerals (M DCCC XC) on the title page. Louis Mullem appears to be a relatively obscure French author, and this work represents French literary perspectives on America during the late 19th century. The dedication to Alphonse Daudet suggests Mullem moved in French literary circles of the period.
