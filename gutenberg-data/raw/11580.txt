Hmm, it seems like the file might just have the header content that was shown to me. Let me analyze what was provided in the prompt:

Based on the text excerpt provided, I can analyze this work:

**"The Teaching of Jesus"** by Rev. George Jackson, B.A., published in **1903**.

The preface reveals this is based on Sunday evening sermons to working-class congregations. Jackson references multiple theological works including Wendt's "Teaching of Jesus," Beyschlag's "New Testament Theology," and Stevens' "Theology of the New Testament," indicating this is a work of Christian theology/biblical scholarship.

The dedication is to his children (Dora, Kenneth, Basil, Arnold), and the epigraph is from 2 John IX. The work appears to be a Protestant (likely Methodist or similar evangelical denomination) exposition of Christ's teachings.

Given that this is a theological/biblical scholarly work about Jesus's teachings written by a Protestant minister in 1903, it would not be considered "Catholic" in the sense you've defined (requiring nihil obstat/imprimatur). While it's about Christ, it's written from a Protestant perspective.
