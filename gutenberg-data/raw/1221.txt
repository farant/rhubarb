Summary = """
A botanical monograph by John Merle Coulter (1851-1928), an American botanist who was a prominent figure in American botany during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This work is a taxonomic study of cacti native to North America, with particular focus on the genera Anhalonium and Lophophora (the latter being the genus containing peyote). Coulter was known for his systematic work on plant taxonomy and served as president of several universities. This monograph would have been part of the scientific effort to catalog and classify the flora of North America during a period of intense botanical exploration.
