Summary = """
Paul et Virginie (Paul and Virginia) is a romantic novel by French author Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, first published in 1788. The story is set on the island of Mauritius (then called Île de France) and tells the tale of two childhood friends, Paul and Virginia, who grow up together in an idyllic natural paradise raised by their mothers who had fled France. The novel explores themes of innocence, natural virtue, the corrupting influence of civilization, and tragic love. When Virginia is sent to France for education and to claim an inheritance, the separation leads to tragedy. The work became enormously popular in the Romantic era and influenced the development of the pastoral novel. It reflects Rousseau's ideas about the nobility of natural life versus the artificiality of civilized society.
