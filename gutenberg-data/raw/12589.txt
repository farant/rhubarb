Summary = """
Notes and Queries was a Victorian-era scholarly periodical founded in 1849 by William John Thoms that served as "A Medium of Inter-Communication for Literary Men, Artists, Antiquaries, Genealogists, Etc." The journal featured scholarly notes, queries (questions posed by readers), and replies on topics ranging from folklore and literary history to genealogy and antiquarian studies. This issue (Number 31, June 1, 1850) contains articles on parish registers, Hudibrastic verse, folk lore, Jeremy Taylor's works, and various scholarly queries and replies typical of the publication. The motto "When found, make a note of" comes from Charles Dickens's Captain Cuttle character.
