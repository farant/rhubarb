I can see this is from "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction," which was a weekly British periodical publication. Based on the header information, this is Volume 20, No. 564, from Saturday, September 1, 1832.

This appears to be a single article about Belvoir Castle from that periodical issue, not a complete standalone book. The Project Gutenberg number 11865 corresponds to this specific issue of the periodical.

Notes = """
The year 1832 is taken from the publication date shown in the header. This is an issue of a periodical rather than a standalone book. The Mirror was published weekly and was priced at 2 pence per issue, making it accessible to a broad readership during the early Victorian era.
