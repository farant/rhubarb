Summary = """
Punch was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire established in 1841 and published until 1992 (with a brief revival 1996-2002). It was highly influential in British culture and coined the term "cartoon" in its modern sense. This issue from June 1919 contains typical Punch content: witty observations on current events, political satire, and social commentary. The references to the trans-Atlantic flight (Alcock and Brown's historic crossing completed June 15, 1919), post-WWI Joy Loans, American prohibition, and Irish Sinn Fein situate it firmly in the immediate post-war period.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1919 is explicit in the masthead. Punch was a weekly periodical so this represents the original publication date. The "Charivari" in the title references Le Charivari, the French satirical magazine that inspired Punch's founding.
