Summary = """
"Les Portes de l'Enfer" (The Gates of Hell) is a collection of short stories by French author Maurice Level (1875-1926), who was known for his horror and suspense tales. Level was a master of the "conte cruel" (cruel tale) genre, writing compact, often macabre stories with twist endings. This collection, like much of his work, explores dark psychological themes - the excerpt shown deals with grief and loss after a wife's departure. Level was popular in his time and influenced later horror writers; his work was frequently adapted for the Grand Guignol theater in Paris.
