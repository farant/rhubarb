Summary = """
This is a collection of three historical plays by Finnish author Eino Leino, one of Finland's most celebrated poets and playwrights. The three plays dramatize key figures from Finnish medieval history:

1. "Lalli" - About the legendary Finnish peasant who, according to tradition, killed Bishop Henry (Henrik Pyhä), the apostle of Finland, in 1158. This is one of Finland's foundational national legends.

2. "Tuomas piispa" (Bishop Thomas) - About Thomas, Bishop of Finland in the 13th century.

3. "Maunu Tavast" - About Magnus Tavast, Bishop of Turku in the 15th century, an important figure in Finnish ecclesiastical history.

These plays are part of Leino's "Naamioita" (Masks) series, which explored Finnish historical and mythological themes through drama.
"""

Notes = """
The plays were published across 1907-1909 as indicated in the text. I chose 1907 as the year since that's when the first play (Lalli) was published as part of "Naamioita II". Eino Leino (1878-1926) was a central figure in Finnish literature during the National Romantic period. Bishop Henry's martyrdom by Lalli is a semi-legendary event traditionally dated to 1158, and forms part of Finland's Christian origin story, though the historical accuracy is debated.
