Summary = """
A collection of lyric poetry by American poet Elizabeth Stoddard (1823-1902), published in 1895. The poems explore themes of nature, the seasons, marriage, domesticity, youth, memory, and psychological introspection. Stoddard was known for her realistic and often unconventional treatment of women's inner lives and marital relationships.

Her work is characterized by directness, psychological depth, and a somewhat melancholic sensibility that was distinctive in 19th-century American poetry.

Notes = """
The year 1895 represents the publication date of this specific collection. While Stoddard had been writing poetry throughout her career (starting in the 1850s), this appears to be a compiled collection published late in her life. Not marked as appropriate-for-children due to mature psychological themes and adult perspectives on marriage and relationships. Not tagged as Catholic as Stoddard was not a Catholic writer.
