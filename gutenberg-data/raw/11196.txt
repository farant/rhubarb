I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information in TOML format.

This appears to be an article titled "Thomas Paine's Second Appearance in the United States" published in The Atlantic Monthly, Volume IV, July 1859, Issue XXI. This is a magazine article/essay, not a standalone book. The author is not explicitly stated in this excerpt, but Atlantic Monthly articles from this era were often published anonymously or would have the author's name elsewhere in the full article.

Summary = """
This is an essay from The Atlantic Monthly magazine published in July 1859, 
examining Thomas Paine's return to the United States and the partisan political 
atmosphere of the early American republic. The article discusses the intense 
party divisions between Federalists and Anti-Federalists in the years following 
the adoption of the Constitution, providing historical context for understanding 
the reception of controversial figures like Paine. The author reflects on how 
the political violence and bitterness of that era exceeded even the sectional 
tensions of 1859 (on the eve of the Civil War). This is a piece of historical 
analysis and political commentary characteristic of Atlantic Monthly's literary 
and intellectual content in the mid-19th century.
"""

Notes = """
Year chosen: 1859 - the publication date in The Atlantic Monthly. This is a 
magazine article, not a standalone work, so the publication year is the most 
historically accurate date. This is NOT a work by Thomas Paine himself, but 
rather a 19th-century essay about Paine's historical impact.
