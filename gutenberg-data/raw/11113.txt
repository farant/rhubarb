I'll help you identify this text. Based on the preface, this is clearly a biography of Principal John Cairns, written by someone also named Cairns (likely a relative). Let me analyze what I can determine:

**Title**: "Principal Cairns" by John Cairns (referring to a biography about John Cairns, D.D., LL.D.)

**Author**: The author is writing about Principal John Cairns and references their uncle William Cairns and father David Cairns. The author mentions "my brother the Rev. D.S. Cairns" - this would be David S. Cairns. Given the family connections and the references to the MacEwen biography, this is likely written by **John Cairns** (the nephew, not the subject).

**Year**: The text references Professor MacEwen's "Life and Letters of John Cairns, D.D. LL.D." as already published. That work was published in 1895. This biography appears to be part of the "Famous Scots Series" and would have been published after MacEwen's work, likely around **1907** (when the Famous Scots Series was active).

**Principal John Cairns** (the subject) was a prominent Scottish United Presbyterian Church leader and theologian (1818-1892).

Year estimated as 1907 based on the Famous Scots Series publication period and the fact it post-dates MacEwen's 1895 biography which it references extensively.
