north. Roy J. Snell was a prolific American author who wrote numerous \

Notes = """
The year 1920 is clearly stated in the original publication information \
and represents the actual publication date of this work. This appears to \
be the original edition published by Reilly & Lee Company as part of \
their juvenile adventure series. Roy J. Snell (1878-1959) was writing \
during the immediate post-WWI era when aviation stories were extremely \
popular with young readers, and he capitalized on this interest with \
stories featuring recently discharged aviators having adventures.\
