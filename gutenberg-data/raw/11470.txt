Summary = """
"His Big Opportunity" is a children's novel by Amy Le Feuvre, a prolific British author known for her evangelical Christian fiction for young readers. Le Feuvre wrote numerous popular children's books in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, often featuring moral lessons and Christian themes woven into engaging stories about children's adventures and character development. Her works, including "Teddy's Button" and "Probable Sons," were widely read in both Britain and America and emphasized values of faith, courage, and doing good deeds. "His Big Opportunity" follows this pattern, likely telling the story of a young protagonist who encounters a significant chance to demonstrate character and faith.
