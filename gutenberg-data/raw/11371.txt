Based on the opening, this is clearly "The Moorland Cottage" by Elizabeth Gaskell (the author of "Mary Barton" as stated in the text). The work was first published in 1850, though this particular edition shows 1851 (likely a reprint).

Summary = """
The Moorland Cottage is a novella by Elizabeth Gaskell, first published in December 1850. It tells the story of Mrs. Browne, a widow living in a secluded cottage on the moorlands with her two children, Maggie and Edward, and their faithful servant Nancy. The tale explores themes of maternal favoritism, moral education, and the consequences of character formation. Mrs. Browne unwisely favors her son Edward over her daughter Maggie, leading to Edward's moral weakness and Maggie's quiet strength. The story is set in rural England and is characteristic of Gaskell's attention to domestic life and moral development. It's a shorter work compared to her major novels like Mary Barton or North and South, but demonstrates her skill in portraying family dynamics and social commentary within a compact narrative.
"""

Notes = """
The text states "NEW YORK: 1851" but this appears to be an American reprint. The work was first published in England in December 1850, so I've used 1850 as the original publication year, which is more historically accurate for timeline purposes. Elizabeth Gaskell was a Unitarian rather than Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag is not applicable despite her deeply moral and Christian themes.
