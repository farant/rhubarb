Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly magazine published from 1822 to 1849. It was one of the earliest cheap periodicals aimed at a general readership, predating the penny dreadfuls and helping to democratize access to literature and knowledge. Each issue contained a mix of illustrated articles on architecture, history, literature, science, and miscellaneous curiosities. This particular issue (Vol. XIX, No. 530) from January 21, 1832 features an article about the Law Institution building in Chancery Lane, London, with an engraved illustration of its Ionic portico.
"""

Notes = """
Year is 1832 as printed on the issue itself. The magazine as a whole ran 1822-1849, but for timeline purposes the publication date of this specific issue is most appropriate. The periodical was published by John Limbird and was notable for bringing illustrated content to a mass audience at the low price of 2 pence.
