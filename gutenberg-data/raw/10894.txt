Summary = """
This is a volume from James D. Richardson's monumental compilation of presidential messages and papers, focusing on John Adams's presidency from March 4, 1797 to March 4, 1801. Richardson's compilation was a comprehensive collection of official presidential documents, proclamations, messages to Congress, and other papers from the presidents of the United States. This particular volume includes biographical information about John Adams and his presidential communications. The compilation was commissioned by Congress and became the standard reference work for presidential documents of the era.
"""

Notes = """
The complete compilation by Richardson was published in multiple volumes starting in 1896-1899 by order of Congress. While John Adams's presidency occurred 1797-1801, this compilation itself was published nearly a century later. I chose 1896 as the year because this is Richardson's editorial work and compilation, not Adams's original writings. The historical value lies both in the primary source documents and in Richardson's role as compiler and editor of this important reference work.
