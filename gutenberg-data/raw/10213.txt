"""

Notes = """
Jackson Gregory published "The Everlasting Whisper" in 1922. Gregory (1882-1943) was a contemporary of Zane Grey and wrote numerous popular Western novels and adventure stories during the early-to-mid 20th century. The book was published by Charles Scribner's Sons, as indicated by the dedication to Maxwell E. Perkins, who was a famous editor at Scribner's and worked with many notable American authors. This is clearly adventure/Western fiction appropriate for general audiences, not a Catholic work despite Gregory's Irish-American background.
