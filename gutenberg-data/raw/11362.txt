[Summary]
description = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical published in the early 19th century. This particular issue (Vol. 12, No. 322) from July 12, 1828, features an illustrated article about Clarence Terrace in Regent's Park, London. The publication was known for combining educational content with entertainment, featuring essays, architectural descriptions, poetry, and engravings. This issue showcases the architectural features of Clarence Terrace, which was named in honor of the Lord High Admiral of England and exemplifies Grecian architectural style with Corinthian and Ionic elements. The Mirror was designed to be accessible and informative for a general middle-class Victorian readership.

[Notes]
year_context = """
The year 1828 is taken from the actual publication date shown on this specific issue (Saturday, July 12, 1828). This is a periodical rather than a single authored work, so the most historically accurate date is the issue's publication date rather than trying to identify an "original" composition date.
