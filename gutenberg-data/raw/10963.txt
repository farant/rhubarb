Summary = """
'The Grip of Desire' (French: 'L'Étreinte du Désir') is a controversial novel by Hector France subtitled 'The Story of a Parish-Priest'. The novel deals with the struggles of a Catholic priest with celibacy and sexual desire. France was a French journalist and author known for his anti-clerical works in the late 19th/early 20th century. This work was considered scandalous at the time of publication for its frank treatment of priestly sexuality and its critique of Catholic clerical celibacy requirements.
"""

Notes = """
The original French edition was published around 1903. Hector France (1837-1908) was a controversial French author known for his anti-clerical and libertine works. This novel is explicitly anti-clerical in nature and would definitely NOT be considered appropriate for children or receive a nihil obstat or imprimatur from Catholic authorities, despite dealing with Catholic clergy as subject matter. The work was translated into English by Alfred Allinson, who translated many of France's works.
