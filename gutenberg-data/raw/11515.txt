Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British \
weekly periodical published in the 19th century. This particular issue is \
from Volume XIX, Number 532, dated Saturday, February 4, 1832, and sold \
for 2 pence. The magazine featured a mix of literary content, news, \
illustrations, cultural commentary, and educational material aimed at a \
general educated audience. This issue appears to focus on "Robert the Devil" \
(Robert le Diable), discussing the French opera and its popularity in Paris \
and anticipated adaptations in London theaters. The publication was designed \
to provide accessible entertainment and instruction to middle-class Victorian \
readers.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1832 is straightforward here as this is a periodical with a specific \
publication date clearly stated in the title: Saturday, February 4, 1832. \
This is not a timeless literary work but a dated magazine issue, so the \
original publication date is the relevant historical date.
