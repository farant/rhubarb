Published in 1850, shortly after the 1848 Revolution that established the Second Republic in France. The work reflects the complex political situation of the Bonaparte family during this period, including the law of April 10, 1832 that banished the family from France. Pierre-Napoléon Bonaparte (1815-1881) was a controversial figure in French history, and this work represents his personal perspective on his military aspirations and experiences in North Africa.
