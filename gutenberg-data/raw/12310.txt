Summary = """
"Walking" is one of Henry David Thoreau's most celebrated essays, originally published in The Atlantic Monthly in June 1862, shortly after his death. The essay is a philosophical meditation on the spiritual and physical act of walking in nature. Thoreau advocates for absolute freedom and wildness, arguing that humans should see themselves as part of nature rather than merely members of civil society. He explores the concept of "sauntering" - walking with purpose and reverence - and emphasizes the importance of wildness and the preservation of nature. The essay reflects Thoreau's transcendentalist philosophy and his belief in the restorative and enlightening power of communion with the natural world. It remains a foundational text in American nature writing and environmental thought.

Notes = """
This essay was published posthumously in June 1862 in The Atlantic Monthly, though Thoreau had delivered versions of it as lectures in the 1850s. The year 1862 represents its first publication in written form and is the most historically appropriate date for this work. Thoreau died in May 1862, making this one of his final published works.
