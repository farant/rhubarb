Notes = """
The year 1916 is clearly stated on the title page as the publication date. "Clair W. Hayes" was likely a pseudonym used by the Burt Company publishers for this series. The Boy Allies series was part of a broader genre of juvenile war fiction popular during WWI, designed to build support for the war effort among young readers while providing exciting adventure stories.
