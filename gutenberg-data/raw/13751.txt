Title = "Characters from the Histories & Memoirs of the Seventeenth Century"
Author = "David Nichol Smith"
Year = 1918

Tags = ["non-fiction", "historical-document", "anthology"]

Summary = """
This is an anthology compiled and edited by David Nichol Smith, a Scottish literary scholar and professor at Oxford. The work collects character sketches—a popular literary form in the 17th century—drawn from various historical memoirs and histories of that era. It prominently features character portraits by Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, from his famous "History of the Rebellion." The book includes an introductory essay on the character as a literary genre, tracing its origins and development. The subjects include James I, the Duke of Buckingham, and various English nobles of the period.
"""

Notes = """
1918 is the publication date of this edited anthology. The individual character sketches within were written during the 17th century by their respective authors (Arthur Wilson, Sir Anthony Weldon, Clarendon, etc.). Since this is primarily Smith's editorial work with substantial introductory essay and historical notes, the anthology publication date is most appropriate for a timeline.
