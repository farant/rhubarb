A collection of poetry by William Douw Lighthall, a Canadian lawyer, author, and poet from Montreal. Lighthall was a significant figure in early Canadian literature and was involved in promoting Canadian national identity through literature.

"""

Notes = """
The publication year 1887 is clearly stated on the title page ("Witness" Printing House, Montreal). Lighthall (1857-1954) was a notable Montreal advocate and literary figure who later edited the influential anthology "Songs of the Great Dominion" (1889). The "W.D." stands for William Douw.
