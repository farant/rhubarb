Notes = """
The year 1828 is the specific publication date of this issue (Vol. XII, No. 336, dated October 18, 1828). This is a periodical rather than a single authored work, so 'Various' is listed for the author field. The Mirror was known for its high-quality engravings and its mission to make knowledge accessible to ordinary people during the Victorian era.
