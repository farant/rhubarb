Summary = """
'Monarch, The Big Bear of Tallac' is one of Ernest Thompson Seton's animal biography stories, published in 1919 with 100 illustrations by the author. Seton was a pioneering naturalist and wildlife artist who created a popular genre of realistic animal stories that combined natural history observation with narrative storytelling. This book tells the epic tale of a grizzly bear in the Tallac region (likely referring to Mount Tallac in the Lake Tahoe area of California). The story was reportedly told to Seton by rough mountain men around a campfire, and he transformed their fragmented accounts into a cohesive narrative. Like his other works such as 'Wild Animals I Have Known' and 'Biography of a Grizzly', this book aims to portray the life and personality of an individual wild animal with both scientific accuracy and dramatic storytelling.
