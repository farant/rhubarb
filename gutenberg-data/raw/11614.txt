Summary = """
'The Second Generation' is a novel by David Graham Phillips, an American \
journalist and novelist who was part of the muckraking movement. Phillips was \
known for his social realist fiction that criticized American society, \
particularly the wealthy class and political corruption. This novel explores \
themes common to Phillips' work: the inheritance of wealth, the moral decay of \
the upper classes, and the challenges faced by those who inherit rather than \
earn their fortunes. The chapter titles suggest a narrative about family \
legacy, wills, legal matters, and romantic entanglements within the context of \
generational wealth transfer. Phillips' work often examined how second-generation \
wealth affected character and society.\
"""

Notes = """
The year 1906 is clearly indicated on the title page. This was during Phillips' \
most productive period as a novelist. He was not a Catholic author - he was a \
secular progressive reformer and muckraker who was critical of many American \
institutions. The work would not be considered suitable for an imprimatur. \
Phillips was assassinated in 1911 by a man who believed one of his novels \
defamed his family.\
