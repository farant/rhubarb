Notes = """
The publication year 1921 is clearly stated in the text itself. Max Brand (Frederick Faust, 1892-1944) was not Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag is not included. While his Westerns contain action and violence typical of the genre, they were generally considered appropriate for younger readers during their era, being adventure stories without explicit content.
