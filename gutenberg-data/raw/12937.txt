Summary = """
This is a boys' adventure novel from the early 20th century, part of the "Boy Hunters" series. The story follows young protagonists on an outdoor expedition combining hunting and the then-novel hobby of photography. The narrative includes encounters with various wild animals (deer, wildcats, bears, a lion, and a chimpanzee - likely escaped from a circus based on the chapter titles), river adventures through rapids, and conflicts with antagonists ("the Spink Crowd"). It's representative of the popular juvenile adventure fiction of the era that emphasized outdoor skills, self-reliance, and wholesome excitement.
