Summary = """
This is the eighth book in the Rover Boys series, a popular juvenile adventure series written under the pseudonym "Arthur M. Winfield" by Edward Stratemeyer. The series follows the adventures of three brothers—Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover—as they attend boarding school and have various adventures. The Rover Boys series was one of the earliest and most successful of Stratemeyer's many series aimed at young readers, predating his more famous Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys franchises. The books were formulaic adventure stories designed to appeal to boys, featuring mysteries, outdoor adventures, and wholesome values typical of early 20th century juvenile fiction.
