Summary = """
This is a famous essay by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, first published in The Atlantic Monthly in April 1862. It offers practical advice and encouragement to aspiring writers who submit manuscripts to magazines. Higginson addresses common misconceptions about editors and the publishing process, explaining that editors and writers share the same interests, and that there is no prejudice against new contributors. The essay became influential in American literary history, particularly because it prompted Emily Dickinson to begin her correspondence with Higginson, asking him to be her "preceptor." The piece is both pragmatic and encouraging, balancing honesty about the challenges of getting published with genuine support for new writers.
