Summary = """
Notes and Queries was a British weekly literary magazine founded in 1849 by William John Thoms. It served as a forum for scholars, antiquaries, and literary enthusiasts to pose questions and share knowledge on matters of history, literature, etymology, folklore, and genealogy. The publication became famous for its collaborative approach to scholarship, allowing readers to submit queries which other readers would then attempt to answer. The magazine's motto, "When found, make a note of," comes from Captain Cuttle in Dickens's Dombey and Son. This particular issue (No. 40) from August 3, 1850 contains typical content including notes on Milton and Juvenal, folklore items, etymological queries, and various literary discussions.
