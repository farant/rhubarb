Notes = """
The year 1921 reflects the first publication date of this collection by J. M. Dent. While individual essays were written and published earlier (as indicated by dates like 1905 and 1898 in the contents), the collection as a unified work appeared in 1921, making this the most appropriate date for historical timeline purposes.
