"""

Notes = """
Mrs. Lawrence Turnbull (née Francese Hubbard Litchfield) was an American author. The 1900 date appears on the title page as the original publication year. While the setting is 16th century Venice, this is a work of historical fiction written in the late Victorian era, not a primary historical document.
