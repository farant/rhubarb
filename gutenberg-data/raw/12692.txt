Summary = """
This is part of H. Irving Hancock's "High School Boys Series," a popular early 20th-century series of juvenile sports fiction. The book follows Dick Prescott and his companions as they navigate high school athletics, particularly football. The series was typical of the wholesome, character-building sports fiction popular in the Progressive Era, emphasizing teamwork, leadership, fair play, and moral rectitude. These books were designed to inspire young readers with tales of athletic achievement combined with good citizenship and clean living. The "Dick & Co." books were part of a larger trend of boys' series fiction that dominated American juvenile literature in the early 1900s.
