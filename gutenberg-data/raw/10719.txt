I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

This appears to be an issue of "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction," a British periodical magazine rather than a single-author book. Let me provide the structured information:

Title = "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Vol. 12, No. 349"
Author = "Various"
Year = 1828

Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical magazine published in the early to mid-19th century. It featured a wide variety of content including articles on architecture, art, poetry, historical subjects, scientific topics, and general knowledge. The magazine was known for its engravings and illustrations, making cultural and educational content accessible to a broad middle-class readership. This particular issue from December 6, 1828, includes an article about the Arch of Constantine in Rome, along with references to fine arts and a supplement containing poetry from various annuals and a Turner engraving.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1828 is taken directly from the masthead of this issue (Vol. 12, No. 349, Saturday, December 6, 1828). This is a periodical publication rather than a standalone book, so the date represents when this specific issue was published. The Mirror ran from approximately 1822 to 1849 under various titles.
