I'll analyze this text from Project Gutenberg to identify the work and provide the requested information.

This is clearly a periodical publication - "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction" from 1831. This was a Victorian-era magazine that published various articles, engravings, and pieces of general interest. The specific text shown is an article about Mocha (the Arabian port city famous for coffee exports) from Volume 17, Number 485, dated Saturday, April 16, 1831.

Since this is a periodical rather than a single-author work, and the article appears to be editorial content drawing from Lord Valentia's travel writings, I'll structure the information accordingly:

Title = "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Vol. 17, No. 485"
