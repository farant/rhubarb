Notes = """
The year 1831 is taken from the publication date printed on this specific issue. "The Mirror" was a Victorian-era magazine that ran from 1822 to 1849, and this represents one issue from its mid-period run. The author is listed as "Various" because these periodicals were typically compilations of contributions from multiple writers and editors, often anonymous or pseudonymous.
