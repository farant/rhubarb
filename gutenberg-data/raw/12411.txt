Summary = """
'The Long White Cloud' (Ao Tea Roa in Māori) is a comprehensive historical account of New Zealand written by William Pember Reeves, who served as Agent-General in London for New Zealand. The book chronicles New Zealand's history from Māori settlement through European colonization to the late 19th century. Reeves was a prominent New Zealand politician, poet, and historian who played a significant role in the country's labour reforms. The work is considered one of the most important early histories of New Zealand and provides detailed accounts of Māori culture, European settlement, colonial conflicts (including the New Zealand Wars), and the development of New Zealand's political and economic institutions. The title 'Ao Tea Roa' (more commonly spelled 'Aotearoa') is the Māori name for New Zealand, often translated as 'Land of the Long White Cloud.'
"""

Notes = """
The year 1899 is straightforward as this appears to be the first edition published while Reeves was serving as Agent-General in London. This is the original publication date of the work itself, not a translation or later edition. The book was written for a British audience to educate them about New Zealand's history and development as a self-governing colony.
