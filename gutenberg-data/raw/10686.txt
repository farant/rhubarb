I need to analyze this text from Project Gutenberg to identify the title, author, year, and other relevant information.

From the text, I can see:
- The title is clearly "Tine"
- The author is "Herman Bang"
- The publication year stated is 1889 (published October 18-24, 1889)
- This is a Danish novel

Herman Bang was a Danish author and journalist (1857-1912), one of the most prominent Danish realist writers. "Tine" is one of his major works, a historical novel set during the Second Schleswig War (1864). The work deals with themes of loss, suffering, and the impact of war on ordinary people, particularly women.

The text shows this is the original Danish publication with dedication "Til Erindring om min Moder" (To the Memory of My Mother), which is a touching personal dedication from Bang to his mother.
