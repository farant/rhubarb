Summary = """
'The Folk-Lore of Plants' is a systematic survey of plant folklore compiled by T. F. Thiselton-Dyer, a British botanist and writer. The work examines the various folk beliefs, superstitions, and cultural traditions that have developed around plants throughout history. The book covers topics including plant worship, the role of plants in witchcraft and demonology, lightning plants, fairy-lore associated with plants, and primitive and savage notions about plant life. Written in the Victorian era when folklore studies were gaining considerable popularity in Britain and on the Continent, this work serves as a comprehensive handbook synthesizing existing research on botanical folklore into a concise, systematic format. The author's goal was to provide readers with an accessible overview of how human culture has interpreted and mythologized the vegetable kingdom across different societies and time periods."""
