I can see this is the beginning of Project Gutenberg ebook #11177, but the text you've provided consists only of advertisements from what appears to be the front matter of a 19th century publication. These advertisements (for a printing house, publisher seeking agents, and cod-liver oil) don't reveal the actual title, author, or content of the work itself.

To properly identify the title, author, year, and provide accurate metadata, I would need to see more of the text - specifically:
- The actual title page
- The main content of the work
- Any preface, introduction, or body text

Could you provide more of the text beyond these initial advertisements? Usually Project Gutenberg books have the title and author information shortly after the initial header and any front matter.

Alternatively, if you have the Project Gutenberg ebook number (11177), I could potentially search for information about it, though I'd prefer to base my analysis on the actual text content you're working with to ensure accuracy for your timeline project.
