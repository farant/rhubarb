Summary = """
A collection of poems by Marietta Holley, an American humorist and poet best known for her "Samantha" series written under the pen name "Josiah Allen's Wife." While Holley was famous for her satirical prose advocating for women's suffrage and temperance, this collection represents her more sentimental poetic work. The poems cover themes of nature, love, loss, memory, and romantic narratives, dedicated touchingly to the memory of her mother.
