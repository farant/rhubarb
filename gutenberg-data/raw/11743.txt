Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly magazine published from 1822 to 1849. It was one of the first cheap literary magazines in England, aimed at making literature and information accessible to the general public at an affordable price (2 pence). The magazine contained a mix of articles on history, architecture, biography, poetry, and general interest topics. This particular issue from May 1832 features an article about the newly completed Staines Bridge over the River Thames, which was opened by King William IV and Queen Adelaide. The publication was founded by John Limbird and was notable for its illustrated content and encyclopedic approach to popular education.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1832 is taken directly from the publication date shown in the issue header (May 26, 1832). This is a periodical rather than a standalone book, so the relevant date is the issue's publication date. The magazine ran for 27 years and was an important part of the early Victorian effort to bring affordable literature to the masses.
