Summary = """
"Missing" is a World War I novel by Mary Augusta Ward (Mrs. Humphry Ward), a popular and prolific English novelist of the late Victorian and Edwardian era. The novel deals with the emotional trauma of war, particularly focusing on wives and families left behind when soldiers are reported as "wounded and missing" - a devastating category that left loved ones in agonizing uncertainty. Ward was known for her socially conscious fiction and was one of the bestselling authors of her time, though her reputation has faded considerably since. The frontispiece depicting the telegram notification of a husband being "wounded and missing" immediately establishes the central dramatic tension of the work.

She was notably anti-suffrage despite her literary prominence. "Missing" was part of her later output responding to the Great War.
