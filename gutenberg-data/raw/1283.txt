Summary = """
This is one of the books in the Tom Swift series, a popular early 20th-century American juvenile science fiction series. The Tom Swift books follow the adventures of a young inventor and his friends as they create various technological marvels and travel the world having adventures. In this particular installment, Tom Swift invents a "wizard camera" for taking moving pictures and travels to exotic locations including India to film exciting events like elephant stampedes, lion fights, avalanches, volcanic eruptions, and native battles. The series was hugely influential in shaping American attitudes toward technology and invention, and inspired many future scientists and engineers. "Victor Appleton" was a house pseudonym used by the Stratemeyer Syndicate, with various ghostwriters producing the books.
