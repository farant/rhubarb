Summary = """
A spiritual fantasy novel by A.C. Benson, a prolific English essayist and academic who was Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge. The book is a visionary work exploring themes of the afterlife, spiritual growth, and the soul's journey. Benson was known for his contemplative, introspective writing style. He was the son of Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, and brother to E.F. Benson and R.H. Benson (the latter a Catholic priest and novelist). Despite his Anglican background, Benson's spiritual writings tend toward a broad, mystical Christianity rather than strict denominational boundaries.
