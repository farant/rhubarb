Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British periodical published weekly in the early 19th century. It contained a mixture of articles on architecture, literature, history, science, and general knowledge, often illustrated with engravings. This particular issue (Vol. 13, No. 351, dated January 10, 1829) features an article about Macclesfield Bridge in Regent's Park, London, describing its architectural features in detail. The publication was designed to provide accessible educational content and entertainment to middle-class Victorian readers, covering topics ranging from engineering and architecture to literature and current events.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1829 is taken directly from the publication date shown on the document itself (Saturday, January 10, 1829). This is a periodical rather than a single-author work, so "Various" is appropriate for the author field. The Mirror was published weekly and featured contributions from multiple writers. This type of publication was common in the early 19th century as a way to disseminate knowledge and culture to an expanding literate middle class.
