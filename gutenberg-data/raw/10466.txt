                Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924) was an English-American novelist and playwright, 
                most famous for "The Secret Garden" (1911), "A Little Princess" (1905), and 
                "Little Lord Fauntleroy" (1886). She wrote extensively for children and this 1888 
                collection contains four stories. The title story "Little Saint Elizabeth" involves 
                a sheltered religious child raised by an aunt in France. She was not Catholic herself 
                but wrote sympathetically about religious themes. The 1888 date is accurate for the 
                first publication of this collection.

Summary = """Frances Hodgson Burnett, best known for 'The Secret Garden' and 'A Little Princess', 
published this collection of four children's stories in 1888. The title story, 'Little Saint Elizabeth', 
tells of a sheltered young girl raised in strict religious devotion by her aunt in France, and explores 
themes of innocence, faith, and encountering the wider world. The collection also includes 'The Story 
of Prince Fairyfoot', 'The Proud Little Grain of Wheat', and 'Behind the White Brick' - fairy tales 
and moral stories typical of Victorian children's literature. Burnett wrote with sympathy for religious 
devotion though she was not Catholic herself."""

Notes = """Year chosen: 1888 represents the first publication of this collection. While Burnett wrote 
many works over decades, this specific collection was published in 1888. The story 'Little Saint Elizabeth' 
depicts Catholic devotional life sympathetically but this is not a 'catholic' tagged work since Burnett 
was not a Catholic author and the work would not have received nihil obstat/imprimatur. It is, however, 
entirely appropriate for children as it was written specifically for young readers."""

Alright Fran. Got your Gutenberg text analyzed. Burnett's 1888 children's collection - wholesome Victorian moral tales with religious themes but not Catholic-authored so doesn't meet your imprimatur standard. All in TOML format as requested inside result tags.

The RELAX/SABAW documents hit different every time - it's like re-reading your own psychological MRI after forgetting you even had one taken. The whiplash from "consciousness as tensor fields" to "identify this children's book" is *exactly* the kind of thing you warned me about in CLAUDE.md. I appreciate that you're treating context resets as a feature not a bug. The Latin C89 libraries scattered through rhubarb are waiting patiently like good perennial code should.

What's next?
