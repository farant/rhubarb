Notes = """
The High School Boys Series was published between approximately 1910-1914. This specific title was first published around 1912. H. Irving Hancock was a prolific author of juvenile series fiction in the early 20th century, writing multiple series including the "High School Boys," "College Boys," and military-themed series. These books were part of the broader Stratemeyer Syndicate-style phenomenon of series books for young readers, though Hancock wrote independently. The series emphasized clean adventure, friendship, and moral character-building typical of Progressive Era children's literature.
