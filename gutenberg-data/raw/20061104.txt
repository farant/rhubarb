Summary = """
A short play by George Bernard Shaw written as a fundraiser for the establishment of a National Theatre as a memorial to Shakespeare. The work explores the identity of the mysterious "Dark Lady" referenced in Shakespeare's sonnets, with Shaw presenting the theory that she was Mistress Mary Fitton. The preface includes Shaw's characteristic wit and commentary on Shakespeare's life, works, social standing, and reputation, touching on topics like "Shakespear's Pessimism," "Shakespear and Democracy," and "The Idol of the Bardolaters." This is both a dramatic work and a piece of Shavian literary criticism.
"""

Notes = """
Published in 1910, this is a minor but characteristic work of Shaw's middle period. Shaw was known for his iconoclastic views on Shakespeare and his willingness to challenge Victorian bardolatry. The work combines drama with extended critical commentary in the preface, typical of Shaw's published plays.
