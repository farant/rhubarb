Notes = """
The year 1911 is the publication date shown on the title page. Juhani Aho was not a Catholic author - Finland was predominantly Lutheran - so the 'catholic' tag is not applicable. The work is a valuable historical document about Finnish journalism and political life during a formative period in Finnish national history.
