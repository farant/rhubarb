Summary = """
The Tatler was a pioneering British periodical published from April 1709 to January 1711, founded by Richard Steele under the pseudonym Isaac Bickerstaff. Joseph Addison became a major contributor. The publication appeared three times weekly and covered topics including politics, literature, manners, morals, and social commentary. It was enormously influential in shaping English prose style and the emerging genre of the periodical essay. The Tatler, along with its successor The Spectator, helped establish the coffeehouse culture of literary discourse and is considered foundational to English journalism and the essay form.

Notes = """
Year 1709 chosen as the year the original Tatler began publication (April 12, 1709). The Gutenberg text is the 1899 Aitken scholarly edition, but the work itself dates to 1709-1711. The primary author is Richard Steele, with significant contributions from Joseph Addison; other minor contributors existed but these two are the principal figures.
