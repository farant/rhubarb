Summary = """
This volume contains two works by George Sand (pseudonym of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin, Baroness Dudevant), the prolific French novelist and memoirist of the Romantic era. "Francia" is a novel first published in 1872, and "Un bienfait n'est jamais perdu" (A good deed is never lost) is a shorter work included in this collection. George Sand was one of the most popular writers in Europe during her lifetime, known for her novels exploring themes of love, social reform, and rural French life. She was also famous for her unconventional lifestyle, including wearing men's clothing and her relationships with notable figures like Frédéric Chopin and Alfred de Musset.
"""

Notes = """
George Sand published "Francia" in 1872. While Sand was baptized Catholic and lived in a Catholic culture, her works generally don't carry the religious imprimatur character - she was known for progressive and sometimes anti-clerical views, so the 'catholic' tag is not applied.
