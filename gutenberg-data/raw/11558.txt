Summary = """
A collection of poems by Samuel Griswold Goodrich (1793-1860), better known by his pseudonym 'Peter Parley.' Goodrich was a highly influential American author and publisher who pioneered children's literature in the United States during the 19th century. This 1851 collection includes nature-themed poetry and illustrated verses about fairies, Native Americans, and the American landscape. The work reflects the Romantic sensibilities of mid-19th century American literature, with themes of nature, imagination, and moral instruction typical of children's poetry of the era.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1851 is taken directly from the title page as this appears to be an original publication rather than a reprint or translation. Goodrich's 'Peter Parley' books were enormously popular and sold millions of copies, making him one of the most widely-read American authors of his time. The illustrations by artists including Billings and Croome, engraved by Lossing & Barrett and others, were characteristic of the high-quality children's book production of Putnam publishing house in this period.
