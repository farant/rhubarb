Summary = """
The Golf Course Mystery is a detective novel published under the house pseudonym "Chester K. Steele," which was used by the Stratemeyer Syndicate (the same literary syndicate behind Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys). The actual ghostwriter was likely W. Bert Foster. The story is a murder mystery set at a golf club, following the investigation of a death that occurs on the course. It features typical early 20th century mystery conventions with amateur sleuthing and period social settings among the upper-middle class golfing community.
