Summary = """
'Rakkautta' (Love) is described as a "traagillinen lemmen tarina" (tragic love story) by Finnish author Maiju Lassila, published in 1912. Maiju Lassila was the pseudonym of Algoth Untola (also known as Algoth Tietäväinen and Irmari Rantamala), a prolific Finnish writer known for his satirical and humorous works. The story appears to be a comedic narrative written in a colloquial, humorous Finnish style typical of Lassila's work, involving social interactions and romantic entanglements. Despite the subtitle claiming it to be "tragic," Lassila's works are generally characterized by their humor and social satire rather than genuine tragedy.
