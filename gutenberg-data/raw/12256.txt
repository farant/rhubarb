I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

Based on the title page, this is "Mistress Penwick" by Dutton Payne. This appears to be a historical romance novel, likely set in 17th or 18th century England based on the chapter titles referencing lords, castles, monasteries, and formal social events like balls.

Dutton Payne was an American author who wrote romantic fiction in the late 19th/early 20th century. "Mistress Penwick" was published in 1897. The novel tells a romantic story involving a young woman (presumably Katherine Penwick) who leaves an Ursuline convent school and becomes involved with the Lord of Crandlemar, with various dramatic events unfolding at balls, castles, and monasteries.

This is not a Catholic work in the sense you've defined (though it mentions Ursulines, a Catholic order), but rather popular romantic fiction by an author writing during the Victorian/Edwardian era.
