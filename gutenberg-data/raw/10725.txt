Title = "The Centralia Conspiracy"
Author = "Ralph Chaplin"
Year = 1920

Tags = ["non-fiction", "historical-document"]

Summary = """
The Centralia Conspiracy is a pamphlet documenting the events surrounding the Centralia Massacre (also called the Armistice Day Tragedy) that occurred on November 11, 1919, in Centralia, Washington. During an Armistice Day parade, violence erupted between members of the American Legion and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), resulting in the deaths of four Legionnaires and one IWW member (Wesley Everest, who was later lynched). Ralph Chaplin, a prominent IWW member, writer, and artist (best known for writing the labor anthem "Solidarity Forever"), wrote this pamphlet to present the IWW's perspective that their members acted in self-defense against an planned attack on their union hall. The work is a primary source document of early 20th century American labor conflict and provides crucial context for understanding the violence between labor organizations and their opponents during the post-WWI Red Scare period.
"""

Notes = """
The pamphlet was published in 1920, shortly after the events it describes. Ralph Chaplin wrote it while the subsequent trial of IWW members was ongoing or recently concluded. The work is highly partisan, presenting the IWW's defense narrative, but remains an important historical document of the labor struggles of the era. This is decidedly not appropriate for children given the violent content and complex political context.
