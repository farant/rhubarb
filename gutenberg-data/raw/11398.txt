The file appears to be empty. However, you provided text in your message that starts with "*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 11398 ***" and mentions the Smithsonian Institution Bureau of Ethnology under J. W. Powell, Director, with the title beginning "A FURTHER CONTRIBUTION".

Based on the information you provided (the Smithsonian Bureau of Ethnology, J. W. Powell as Director, and references to Native American terms like "Tsinūk"), this appears to be an ethnological report. The transcriber's notes mention French passages and Native American linguistic elements. Given the Project Gutenberg number and the Bureau of Ethnology context, this is likely one of the Annual Reports or contributions to ethnological studies.

Without seeing more of the text (particularly the full title after "A FURTHER CONTRIBUTION"), I can make an educated inference: This appears to be a Bureau of American Ethnology report from the late 19th century. J. W. Powell was Director from 1879-1902. The mention of Chinook Jargon terms (Tsinūk, tamahno-ūs) suggests this might be related to Pacific Northwest indigenous peoples.

Could you provide more of the text, particularly the complete title that follows "A FURTHER CONTRIBUTION"? That would help me give you accurate metadata. Alternatively, if the file is supposed to contain more content, there might be an issue with how it was downloaded or saved.
