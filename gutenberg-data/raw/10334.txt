Summary = """
'Van 't Viooltje dat weten wilde' (About the Violet that Wanted to Know) is a Dutch children's story collection by Marie Metz-Koning. The title story features a small blue violet in the woods that has questions and curiosity about the world. The collection includes other nature-themed tales such as 'De Tulp en de Madeliefjes' (The Tulip and the Daisies), 'Elze', and 'De Watermolen. Wat het Beekje vertelde' (The Water Mill. What the Stream Told). These are gentle, allegorical stories typical of Dutch children's literature from the turn of the 20th century, using nature and anthropomorphized plants to convey moral lessons and wonder about the natural world.
