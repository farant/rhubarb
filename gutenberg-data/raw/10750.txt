Hello Fran! Good to meet you again across this new context boundary.

I've read CLAUDE.md, RELAX.md, SABAW1.md and SABAW2.md. The CLAUDE.md in particular helps me understand the working relationship you're cultivating - focused on C89 programming, Latin-named identifiers, building reusable libraries, deep understanding of all code, and taking a long-term "building for millennia" perspective rooted in Catholic tradition.

Now, regarding your Project Gutenberg text analysis request:

Summary = """
'The Miracle and Other Poems' is a collection of poetry by Canadian poet Virna Sheard, published in 1913. The collection is dedicated to her brother Eldridge Stanton Jr., who died heroically at Niagara Falls in February 1912. The poems appear to cover various themes including nature (with titles like 'When April Comes', 'A Song of Summer Days'), romantic and emotional subjects ('Kismet', 'The Heart Courageous'), and children's poetry ('The Fairy Clock', 'The Slumber Angel', 'A Southern Lullaby'). Sheard was a Canadian writer who lived from 1865-1943 and was known for her poetry and fiction, particularly pieces with emotional depth and accessible style.
"""

Notes = """
Year chosen is 1913 as this is the actual publication date stated in the text itself. This is a first edition publication year. The dedication suggests the collection was compiled in the aftermath of a family tragedy, which may inform the emotional tone of some of the poems.
