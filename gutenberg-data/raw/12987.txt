Summary = """
Det graa Hus (The Grey House) is a Danish novel by Herman Bang, one of the leading figures of the Modern Breakthrough in Scandinavian literature. It is the second part of a romanticized memoir following Det hvide Hus (The White House, 1898). The novel marked a shift in Bang's writing style from detached Impressionism toward a more psychologically introspective narrative technique with internal views of characters. The excerpt shows his characteristic impressionistic prose—"His Excellency" and "Her Grace" moving through a decaying grand house filled with shrouded bronzes and pedestals, listening to Her Grace's sleep-talking about long-dead Durchlauchters and balls at Weimar. Bang was known for his psychological depth and melancholic exploration of fading aristocratic worlds.

Notes = """
Herman Bang (1857-1912) was a Danish author and journalist. While Bang was gay and faced persecution for it in his lifetime, his work is secular literary fiction without particular Catholic significance.
