Summary = """
Robinson Crusoe is considered one of the first English novels and a foundational work of Western literature. It tells the story of a shipwrecked mariner who survives alone on a deserted island for 28 years. The narrative explores themes of self-reliance, providence, redemption, and the human capacity for survival. Defoe drew partial inspiration from the real-life story of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway. The novel was enormously influential and essentially created the "castaway" and "desert island" genres that persist to this day.
"""

Notes = """
While this particular edition is from 1801, the original work was first published on April 25, 1719. I chose 1719 as the year since this is clearly Defoe's original novel rather than a substantially annotated or transformed work - the 1801 edition is simply a later printing of the classic text.
