Notes = """
The exact publication year is estimated to be around 1883 based on the style and content of Victorian travel literature. The work represents the genre of travel writing popular in the late 19th century when the Pyrenees became an increasingly fashionable destination for British tourists seeking health, scenery, and Continental culture. The book's focus on Pau reflects the town's status as a popular British winter and spring resort during this period.
