The year 2000 is chosen based on the explicit copyright notice '(c) 2000 by John Moncure Wetterau' in the text itself. The Library of Congress registration number (00-193498) also confirms this as a work registered in 2000. While the Project Gutenberg copyright notice shows 2003, this refers to the digitization date, not the original publication date of the work.
