Notes = """
1922 is the original publication year clearly stated in the text. This is volume 7 of a series, indicating Strömberg was a popular and prolific author at the time. The work is humorous fiction rather than suitable for young children, and while Strömberg may have been culturally Christian as a Swede of that era, this is secular humor rather than Catholic literature.
