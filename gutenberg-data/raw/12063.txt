Summary = """

Notes = """
The year 1829 is taken directly from the publication date shown in the header. This is a periodical publication rather than a single authored work. The Mirror was edited by various editors throughout its run, and contributors were often anonymous or signed with pseudonyms. The publication represents Victorian popular education and the democratization of knowledge in the early 19th century.
