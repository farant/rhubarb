Summary = """
This is the second volume of Robert Kerr's comprehensive compilation and systematic arrangement of voyages and travels throughout history. Kerr (F.R.S. & F.A.S. Edinburgh - Fellow of the Royal Society and Fellow of the Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh) created a multi-volume work that organized accounts of navigation, discovery, and commerce from the earliest ages through the early 19th century. Volume II includes accounts of early pilgrimages from England to the Holy Land (1097-1107), the discovery of Madeira, and the discovery and conquest of the Canary Islands. This work was significant as it made previously scattered historical voyage accounts accessible in a systematic, organized format, serving as an important reference for understanding the history of exploration and maritime commerce.
"""

Notes = """
Published in Edinburgh by William Blackwood and in London by T. Cadell in 1824. This is a compilation/editorial work rather than original exploration accounts. The year 1824 represents when this particular volume was published. Kerr's multi-volume series was an important scholarly work of the early 19th century that organized and preserved historical accounts of voyages and travels. Not tagged as 'appropriate-for-children' as it is a scholarly reference work intended for adult readers and researchers.
