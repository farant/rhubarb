Notes = """
Published in 1915, the same year as its copyright, this book was contemporary war fiction written while WWI was ongoing. "Clair W. Hayes" was likely a house pseudonym used by the Stratemeyer Syndicate or similar publisher for producing series books. The Battle of the Marne (September 1914) was a crucial early WWI battle that halted the German advance on Paris.
