Summary = """
Dew Drops was a weekly Sunday school paper published by David C. Cook Publishing Company, aimed at young children. This issue from February 15, 1914 includes "How Arthur Made Valentines" by May G. Mooar, a charming story about a boy who decides to hand-paint his Valentine's Day cards rather than buy them. The David C. Cook company was (and still is) a major publisher of Christian educational materials. These periodicals typically contained moral lessons wrapped in age-appropriate stories, poems, and activities.

Notes = """
The year 1914 is explicit in the document (February 15, 1914). Dew Drops ran for many decades; this is Volume 37, suggesting the publication began around 1877-1878. While a periodical rather than a book, it represents the popular genre of Sunday school literature that was ubiquitous in American Protestant homes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I marked it 'christian' rather than 'catholic' as David C. Cook was a Protestant/evangelical publisher.
