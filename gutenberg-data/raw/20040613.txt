Notes = """
Willard Bonte was an American illustrator and author active in the early 1900s. This work appears to be from around 1910 based on the style and Bonte's active period. The exact publication date is difficult to confirm, but the aesthetic and publishing conventions place it firmly in the Edwardian era of children's book illustration.
