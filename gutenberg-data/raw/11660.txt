I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

This is clearly a children's fiction book from the early 20th century. Based on the title "Ethel Morton's Enterprise" by Mabell S.C. Smith, this appears to be part of the Ethel Morton series of children's books. Mabell Shippie Clarke Smith was an American author who wrote several series of children's books in the early 1900s. The Ethel Morton series was published around 1915-1920.

From the chapter titles and opening content, this is a wholesome children's story about gardening, community service, and adventure. The writing style, themes (gardening, flower festivals, community involvement), and the innocent nature of the narrative are characteristic of early 20th century children's literature.
