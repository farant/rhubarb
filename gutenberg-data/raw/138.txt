Summary = """
This is a biographical and literary study of the French novelist George Sand (pen name of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin, 1804-1876), one of the most prolific and controversial writers of 19th century France. René Doumic, a French literary critic and member of the Académie française, examines various periods and aspects of Sand's life: her childhood as Aurore Dupin, her unhappy marriage as Baronne Dudevant, her feminist views, her romantic relationships (including the famous affair with Alfred de Musset), her humanitarian ideals, her involvement in the 1848 Revolution, and her later years as the beloved 'Bonne Dame de Nohant.' The work provides both biographical narrative and analysis of her literary genius and influence.
