Summary = """
This is the Finnish translation of Leo Tolstoy's novel "Resurrection" (Ylösnousemus in Finnish), translated by Arvid Järnefelt with the author's permission. The novel tells the story of Dmitri Nehljudov, a Russian nobleman who seeks redemption after recognizing a woman on trial as Katyusha Maslova, someone he had wronged in his youth. The work follows his moral awakening and his attempts to right past wrongs, including following Maslova to Siberia when she is sentenced to hard labor. The novel is considered one of Tolstoy's major works and deals with themes of moral regeneration, social justice, and Christian redemption.
"""

Notes = """
I've chosen 1899 as the publication year, which matches the date shown in the Finnish translation. The novel was originally published in Russian in 1899, and this Finnish translation appears to be from the same year with the author's permission. While Tolstoy (1828-1910) had a complicated relationship with institutional religion and was eventually excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church, this particular work deals extensively with Christian themes of redemption and is appropriate for a historical timeline. I have not included "appropriate-for-children" as the novel deals with mature themes including sexual exploitation and moral degradation. The "catholic" tag is not included as Tolstoy was Russian Orthodox (later excommunicated) rather than Catholic, despite the Christian themes.
