Summary = """
"Aus dem Durchschnitt" (From the Average/From the Ordinary) is a novel by Gustav Falke, a German writer and poet known for his naturalistic and impressionistic style. The work is dedicated to his brother Albert. The opening scene depicts a tragic accident in a Hamburg suburb where a carriage horse falls on icy streets and breaks both front legs, setting a tone of everyday hardship and resignation. Falke was known for his depictions of ordinary life and the struggles of common people in late 19th/early 20th century Germany.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1900 is clearly stated on the title page as the publication date in Hamburg. Gustav Falke (1853-1916) was not a Catholic author - he was part of the German naturalist literary movement. The work depicts everyday life and social realism rather than religious themes.
