Summary = """
The memoirs of Sir Henry Hawkins (1817-1907), who became Baron Brampton, one of the most celebrated English judges and barristers of the Victorian era. Edited by Richard Harris, K.C., these reminiscences provide an insider's view of the English legal system in the 19th century. Hawkins was particularly famous for his role in the Tichborne case, one of the longest and most sensational trials in English legal history. The work offers personal reflections on his long career in advocacy and on the bench, written with the assistance of his friend Harris, who had previously written about Hawkins' work in "Illustrations in Advocacy."
