I can identify this work based on the distinctive text. Let me analyze what I know about it.

From the opening, this appears to be a romantic/adventure novel set in the West Indies, featuring a character named Lenox Hildreth who fled from New England for health reasons. The dramatic illustration caption mentioning "Louis dashed the glowing end of his cigar in the negro's face" suggests this is a sensationalist late 19th-century novel.

This is "A Beautiful Possibility" by Edith Ferguson Black. Based on the Project Gutenberg ebook number (10037) and the style of the writing, this appears to be from the late 19th century. Let me check my knowledge about this author and work.

Edith Ferguson Black was an American author who wrote in the late 1800s. This particular novel appears to have been published around 1889-1890 based on the writing style and conventions. The work is a romantic adventure novel typical of the period.
