Notes = """
This is a secondary source about Juteini, not Juteini's own writing. The publication date of 1915 is clearly stated on the title page (A.G. Wäänäsen Kirjapaino, Heinola, 1915). Juteini himself was an important figure in the Finnish national awakening, writing during the period when Finland was a Grand Duchy under Russia and Finnish-language literature was in its infancy.
