Summary = """
'Récits d'un soldat' (Stories of a Soldier) is a memoir by French author Amédée Achard documenting his experiences as a volunteer soldier during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. The work is divided into parts, including 'Une armée prisonnière' (A Captive Army) and 'Une campagne devant Paris' (A Campaign Before Paris). Achard presents firsthand accounts of the French military disasters, writing from the perspective of an ordinary soldier rather than offering strategic analysis. The preface explains these are notes from a volunteer's notebook, focusing on what he saw, did, and felt amid the collapsing French armies. This is a primary historical source documenting one of France's most devastating military defeats, which led to the fall of the Second Empire and the establishment of the Third Republic.
