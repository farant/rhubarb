Summary = """
A firsthand account by British surgeon Henry Sessions Souttar of his three months serving as Surgeon-in-Chief of the Belgian Field Hospital during the early months of World War I in 1914. The book describes the experiences, atmosphere, and events surrounding the medical work during the German invasion of Belgium, including the fall of Antwerp. Souttar provides a personal narrative of wartime surgery and the challenges faced by medical personnel treating wounded soldiers during one of the most dramatic periods of the Great War.
"""

Notes = """
Published in 1915, shortly after the events described (which took place in late 1914). This is a contemporary war memoir rather than a retrospective history. The work documents the early months of WWI from a medical perspective and provides valuable historical testimony about the Belgian experience during the German invasion.
