Notes = """
Published in 1911. The novel is divided into four books tracing Remington's life from childhood through his political career and eventual scandal. Wells drew heavily on his own experiences in the Fabian Society and his relationships, making this one of his most personal works. The title references Niccolò Machiavelli's political philosophy, which the protagonist attempts to apply to modern British politics.
