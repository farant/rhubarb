I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work, author, and provide the requested information in TOML format.

Based on the text, this is clearly "Les Chasseurs de Chevelures" (The Scalp Hunters) by Captain Mayne Reid, translated into French by Allyre Bureau. Mayne Reid was an Irish-American novelist who wrote adventure novels, and "The Scalp Hunters" was one of his most famous works, originally published in English in 1851. This appears to be a French translation of that work.

The work is an adventure novel set in the American West, dealing with frontier themes. While Mayne Reid was adventurous and wrote exciting tales, his works often contain period-typical attitudes about indigenous peoples and violence that would not be appropriate for children by modern standards.
