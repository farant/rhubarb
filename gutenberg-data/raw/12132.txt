Summary = """
"Three at Table" is a short story by W.W. Jacobs from his 1902 collection "The Lady of the Barge and Others." Jacobs (1863-1943) was an English author primarily known for his humorous maritime tales and supernatural fiction. While he is most famous for "The Monkey's Paw," his body of work includes numerous short stories that blend humor with the macabre. "Three at Table" appears to be a ghost story, as indicated by the opening which describes a conversation in a coffee-room about ghosts and apparitions. Jacobs had a particular talent for combining everyday settings with supernatural elements, and his stories often featured working-class characters and settings along the Thames docklands.
