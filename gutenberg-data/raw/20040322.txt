Summary = """
A reflective essay by Norman Angell, author of the influential 'The Great Illusion,' written in response to the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912. Angell examines his own theories about the futility of war in light of this conflict, which erupted despite diplomatic efforts and economic incentives for peace. The work grapples with the reality that war can emerge from peoples' understanding of their history and perceived duties rather than from ignorance or manipulation by press or financial interests. It represents an important moment of intellectual honesty as Angell confronts the limitations of purely economic arguments against war when faced with nationalist passions and historical grievances in the Balkans.
