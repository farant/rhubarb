Summary = """
This is the second volume of Dawson Turner's detailed account of his tour through Normandy, France. Written as a series of letters addressed to Rev. James Layton, the work documents Turner's investigation of the architectural antiquities of the Norman duchy, with particular focus on medieval churches, abbeys, and castles. Turner examines sites including the Abbey of Jumièges, Château Gaillard, the Cathedral of Evreux, and numerous other architectural landmarks. The work combines architectural analysis with historical observations about the region and its inhabitants, and was originally published with numerous engravings. Turner was part of the early 19th-century antiquarian movement that sought to document and preserve knowledge of medieval architecture before it was lost to time and neglect.
"""

Notes = """
The full work was published in two volumes in 1820. This represents an important early example of architectural tourism and antiquarian scholarship, predating the Victorian Gothic Revival movement. Turner's systematic documentation of Norman architecture was influential in preserving knowledge of medieval buildings, some of which have since been damaged or destroyed.
