Summary = """
'Boy Scouts in Northern Wilds' is an early 20th-century adventure novel written during the initial boom of Boy Scouts literature in America. Part of a series by Major Archibald Lee Fletcher, the story follows Boy Scouts on an expedition in the northern wilderness (likely northern United States or Canada, given references to Moose River). The plot involves wilderness survival, mystery elements (including a "little brass god"), encounters with trappers and a half-breed character, dangerous wildlife (bears), and the use of Boy Scout skills including signaling techniques. These novels were designed to promote Boy Scout values of outdoor skills, resourcefulness, and moral character while providing exciting adventure stories for young readers. Fletcher was a prolific author of Boy Scout fiction during this era, writing numerous titles in similar wilderness adventure settings.

Notes = """
The publication year of 1913 is explicitly stated in the text. This places the work just three years after the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (1910), during the organization's early explosive growth period. These adventure novels served both as entertainment and as promotion for the Boy Scouts movement.
