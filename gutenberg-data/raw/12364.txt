Summary = """
This is a prophetic interpretation work by Uriah Smith, a prominent Seventh-day Adventist theologian and editor. The book presents an interpretation of Revelation 13:11-17, arguing that the United States plays a significant role in biblical end-times prophecy. Smith was one of the most influential Adventist writers of the 19th century and served as editor of the Review and Herald. This work represents a key text in Adventist prophetic interpretation, specifically the doctrine identifying America as the "beast from the earth" in Revelation 13. The book reflects the eschatological concerns of post-Civil War America and the Adventist movement's distinctive approach to biblical prophecy.
"""

Notes = """
Year chosen is 1874 as indicated on the title page. This appears to be the original publication date. Uriah Smith (1832-1903) was not Catholic but rather a leading figure in Seventh-day Adventism, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply. The work represents a specific Protestant millennial interpretation that would be at odds with Catholic eschatology. Not tagged as appropriate for children due to complex theological content.
