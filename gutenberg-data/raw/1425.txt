Summary = """
El Verdugo (The Executioner) is a short story by Honoré de Balzac, set during the Napoleonic Wars in Spain. The tale concerns a French officer and a Spanish noble family during the Peninsular War. It is one of Balzac's earlier works and was later included in his vast literary project "La Comédie humaine" under the section "Études philosophiques." The story explores themes of honor, duty, family loyalty, and the brutal moral dilemmas created by war. The title refers to the grim role one character must assume. It is a dark and tragic tale characteristic of Balzac's philosophical studies.
