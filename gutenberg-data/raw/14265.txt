Summary = """
This is Volume IX of a landmark 55-volume documentary collection covering the history of the Philippine Islands from pre-colonial contact through the end of Spanish rule. The series compiles and translates primary sources including Spanish colonial records, missionary accounts, official correspondence, and other contemporaneous documents. This particular volume covers the years 1593-1597 and includes diplomatic correspondence regarding embassies to Japan and Cambodia, reports on Catholic missions and hospitals, military assessments, and administrative records from the governorship of Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas and his son Luis. The collection was published between 1903-1909 and remains an essential resource for Philippine historiography.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1904 is chosen as Volume IX was published in that year as part of the series (1903-1909). While the documents within date to 1593-1597, the scholarly compilation and annotation by Blair and Robertson constitutes a significant editorial work in its own right. Edward Gaylord Bourne contributed the historical introduction and additional notes. The Catholic tag is appropriate given the extensive coverage of missionary activities and the sympathetic treatment of Spanish Catholic missions throughout the series.
