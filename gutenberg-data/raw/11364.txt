Summary = """
Clarissa Harlowe is one of the longest novels in the English language and is considered Samuel Richardson's masterwork. Written as a series of letters (epistolary novel), it tells the tragic story of Clarissa Harlowe, a virtuous young woman from a wealthy family who is pursued by the rake Robert Lovelace. The novel explores themes of virtue, morality, family duty, and the consequences of seduction in 18th-century English society. Clarissa's family pressures her to marry a wealthy but odious suitor, leading her to fall under the influence of the charming but manipulative Lovelace. The work was enormously influential in its time and remains a landmark of English literature, known for its psychological depth and moral seriousness.
