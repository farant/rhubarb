I'll read through this text to identify the work and provide the structured information you requested.

Based on the text, this is clearly "The Dozen from Lakerim" by Rupert Hughes, published in 1899. This appears to be a boys' adventure story set at a preparatory school/academy. Rupert Hughes was an American author, and this is a sequel to "The Lakerim Athletic Club" mentioned in the author attribution.

Let me provide the structured output in TOML format:

Summary = """
'The Dozen from Lakerim' is a boys' adventure novel by American author Rupert Hughes, \
serving as a sequel to 'The Lakerim Athletic Club'. The story follows a group of boys \
at a preparatory school/academy, focusing primarily on their athletic pursuits, games, \
and social adventures rather than academic studies. The book was originally serialized \
in 'St. Nicholas' magazine (a popular children's periodical of the era), with \
approximately half appearing there before the complete version was published in book \
form. It exemplifies the late 19th-century genre of wholesome boys' fiction that \
emphasized sportsmanship, camaraderie, and character development through athletic \
competition and school life.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1899 is taken directly from the title page. Rupert Hughes (1872-1956) was an \
American novelist, film director, and composer—not a Catholic author. While the book \
would be considered generally wholesome and appropriate for children of the era, it \
does not qualify for the 'catholic' tag as it is secular boys' fiction without \
religious content or a Catholic author perspective.
