Summary = """
A collection of five essays on political economy written by John Stuart Mill in 1829-1830 but not published until 1844. The essays address theoretical questions in economics, particularly issues related to international trade, value theory, and the principles underlying free trade. The preface indicates that only the fifth essay had been previously printed, while the other four remained in manuscript form until controversies over Colonel Torrens' Budget renewed public interest in abstract economic science. The first essay specifically addresses points of contention between Colonel Torrens and his critics regarding trade theory, defending principles Mill had held for over fifteen years that supported free trade while allowing for certain revenue duties that don't function as protectionist measures.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1844 represents the first book publication of this collection, though the essays themselves were written 1829-1830. This publication date is the most historically significant as it marks when Mill's economic theories on these "unsettled questions" became publicly available and influential. Mill is considered one of the most important philosophers and economists of the 19th century, contributing significantly to classical liberal thought.
