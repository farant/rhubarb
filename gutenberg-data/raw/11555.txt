Summary = """
A popular Victorian-era practical guide to small-scale farming and household economy. The book recounts the author's personal experience establishing and running a profitable four-acre farm, covering topics such as dairy management, butter-making, and the financial aspects of small agricultural ventures. It became a bestseller in England, reaching at least twelve editions, and was later published in America with an introduction by Peter B. Mead, editor of The Horticulturist. The work exemplifies the mid-19th century interest in rural self-sufficiency and practical domestic economy.
