Summary = """
The Beggars' Bush is a Jacobean comedy written primarily by John Fletcher with contributions from Francis Beaumont (and possibly Philip Massinger). The play tells the story of Gerrard, the rightful Earl of Flanders, who has been usurped by Wolfort. Gerrard disguises himself as Clause, the King of the Beggars, while his son-in-law Florez poses as Goswin, a rich merchant of Bruges. The play follows their efforts to reclaim the earldom through elaborate disguises and schemes involving a colorful cast of beggars and courtiers. The "beggars' bush" refers to a meeting place for beggars, and the play is notable for its sympathetic portrayal of beggar life and its exploration of themes of disguise, identity, and rightful authority. It was a popular play in its time and remained in the theatrical repertoire for many years.

Notes = """
The play was written circa 1622, though it was not published until 1647 in the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio. The authorship is primarily attributed to Fletcher, with Beaumont having a lesser role (he died in 1616), and some scholars also credit Philip Massinger with portions of the work. I chose 1622 as the date because it represents the approximate date of composition, which is most historically significant for a theatrical work.
