Author = "George Grote"

Tags = ["non-fiction", "philosophy"]

Summary = """
This is a review essay by George Grote, the distinguished historian of ancient Greece and Plato scholar, examining John Stuart Mill's philosophical critique of Sir William Hamilton. Originally published in the Westminster Review in January 1866, the work analyzes the debate between two major figures in 19th-century British philosophy. Hamilton was an influential Scottish philosopher who taught at Edinburgh and shaped a generation of students through his lectures on Logic and Metaphysics. Mill's "Examination" (1865) challenged Hamilton's philosophical positions, and Grote's review discusses this major intellectual confrontation between contrasting approaches to philosophy in Victorian Britain.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1866 reflects the original publication date in the Westminster Review, as noted in the subtitle. While the physical reprint by John Childs and Son is dated 1868, the intellectual and historical significance of the piece is tied to its 1866 appearance, when it contributed to the contemporary philosophical debate following Mill's 1865 publication of his Examination of Hamilton's philosophy. Grote (1794-1871) was well-positioned to evaluate this debate as a prominent philosopher and historian in his own right.
