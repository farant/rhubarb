Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical published in the early-to-mid 19th century. It featured illustrated articles on topics including travel, history, science, literature, and general knowledge, aimed at educating and entertaining middle-class Victorian readers. This particular issue from September 8, 1832 includes an extract from J.S. Buckingham's travel writings describing the luxurious Persian baths of Kermanshah, with detailed architectural descriptions. The magazine was known for its engravings and accessible writing style, making knowledge available to a broad audience during a period of increasing literacy in Britain.
"""

Notes = """
Year chosen is 1832 as this is the publication date of this specific issue. While the magazine ran for many years, each issue should be dated to its actual publication. The extract within (from Buckingham's Travels) was originally published in 1829, but the magazine issue itself is from 1832.
