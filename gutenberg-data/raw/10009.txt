Summary = """
Wild Northern Scenes is a sporting adventure narrative by Samuel H. Hammond describing hunting and fishing expeditions in the wilderness of upstate New York, specifically the region between the St. Lawrence River and Lake Champlain (the Adirondacks). The book chronicles Hammond's experiences with rifle and rod in the untamed forests and lakes of the North Woods during the mid-19th century. It represents an early example of American outdoor literature and wilderness sporting narratives, capturing a period when these northern forests were still relatively pristine and wild. The work is dedicated to John H. Reynolds, Esq., described as a fellow sportsman who shared Hammond's love of nature and outdoor pursuits.
