**Title**: "Christine" 
**Author**: Alice Cholmondeley (also known as Elizabeth von Arnim)
**Year**: 1917 (clearly stated in the header and introduction)

This is an epistolary novel consisting of letters from the author's daughter Christine, who died in Stuttgart in August 1914. The book presents these letters as authentic correspondence, though Alice Cholmondeley was better known by her pen name Elizabeth von Arnim, and this appears to be a semi-fictional or fictionalized account written during WWI.

Summary = """
'Christine' is an epistolary novel published in 1917 by Alice Cholmondeley (pen name Elizabeth von Arnim). The book is framed as a collection of letters written by the author's daughter Christine, who allegedly died in Stuttgart, Germany on August 8, 1914, at the outbreak of World War I. The letters depict the state of mind of German society immediately before the war, as seen through the eyes of an English visitor who initially went to Germany with enthusiasm and good will. The work serves as both a personal memorial and a commentary on the German mindset leading up to WWI, reflecting the growing disillusionment with Germany that developed in Britain during the war years.
"""

Notes = """
The publication year of 1917 is certain from the text itself. Elizabeth von Arnim was a popular novelist of the early 20th century. While presented as authentic letters, the work is generally considered fiction or fictionalized memoir. The framing device of a mother publishing her deceased daughter's letters was a common literary convention of the period.
