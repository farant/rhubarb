Summary = """
A progressive work on human sexuality and relationships written in the early 20th century by A. Maude Royden, a pioneering Anglican preacher and suffragist. The book addresses the "sex problem" from a moral and social perspective, arguing that sexuality is a noble rather than shameful aspect of human nature. Royden advocates for open, honest discussion of sex and relationships, moving beyond the "furtive whispers" and taboos of Victorian-era attitudes. The work reflects the post-World War I era's questioning of traditional sexual mores and seeks to establish a framework for understanding normal human sexuality within an ethical context."""

Notes = """
The preface indicates this is an American edition published after her time as Assistant Preacher at the City Temple, London (1918-1920), suggesting a publication date of 1921. A. Maude Royden (1876-1956) was a prominent Anglican lay preacher, suffragist, and social reformer. While she was Christian and progressive in her theological views, this work is not specifically Catholic and would not have received a nihil obstat or imprimatur, so the 'catholic' tag is not included."""
