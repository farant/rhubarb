Summary = """
Ship's Company is a collection of humorous short stories by W.W. Jacobs, the English author best known for "The Monkey's Paw." This collection features Jacobs' characteristic style of comedic tales often set in maritime or rural English settings, focusing on the everyday adventures and misadventures of sailors, villagers, and other working-class characters. The stories are known for their wit, clever plot twists, and gentle social satire. "Watch-Dogs," the story excerpted here, appears to be a typical Jacobs tale featuring an "oldest inhabitant" narrator telling a humorous story about a well-meaning but misguided gentleman from London and the chaos that ensues from his excessive kindness to animals.
