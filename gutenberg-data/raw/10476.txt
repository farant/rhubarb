Notes = """
The year 1911 is clearly stated on the title page of the Gutenberg text. R. Austin Freeman (1862-1943) was a British writer of detective stories, primarily featuring Dr. Thorndyke. This work was originally published as "The Eye of Osiris" in the UK and as "The Vanishing Man" in the US, both in 1911. Freeman was himself a qualified physician and used his medical knowledge extensively in his detective fiction, essentially creating the medical-legal detective genre.
