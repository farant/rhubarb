Notes = """
The 'Beacon Lights of History' series was published in the 1880s-1890s, with various volumes appearing at different times. Volume II was likely first published around 1884. This is a Protestant American perspective on biblical history rather than a Catholic work, so it does not receive the 'catholic' tag. While it deals with religious subjects, it is a historical-biographical work rather than devotional literature. Not tagged as appropriate for children due to its academic lecture format and complexity.
