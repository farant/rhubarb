Summary = """
"Wild Apples" is an essay by Henry David Thoreau exploring the natural and cultural history of apple trees, particularly wild and uncultivated varieties. The essay traces the apple's connection to human civilization from ancient times through various cultures (Germanic, Greek, Roman, Scandinavian), examines its mythological and symbolic significance, and celebrates the wild apple as superior to cultivated varieties. This work represents Thoreau's characteristic blend of natural history, cultural observation, and philosophical reflection on humanity's relationship with the natural world.

Notes = """
Published posthumously in The Atlantic Monthly in November 1862, several months after Thoreau's death in May 1862. While the publication year is 1862, this represents when it was made public rather than when it was written. However, 1862 is the appropriate year for historical timeline purposes as it marks when the work entered public consciousness and became part of the literary canon.
