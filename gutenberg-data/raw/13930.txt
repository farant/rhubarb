Summary = """
A collection of speeches and addresses delivered by Theodore Roosevelt during his journey from Africa through Europe in 1910, following his famous African safari expedition. The volume includes his Romanes Lecture at Oxford, an address at the Sorbonne in Paris, a speech at the University of Berlin, and his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in Christiania (now Oslo). The Nobel Prize had been awarded to Roosevelt in 1906 for his role in negotiating the Treaty of Portsmouth, which ended the Russo-Japanese War. This collection documents Roosevelt's engagement with European intellectual and political institutions during a significant transition period between his presidency and his later political activities.
"""

Notes = """
1910 is the year of both the delivery of these addresses and their publication. Roosevelt had left the presidency in March 1909, embarked on his African safari immediately after, and this European tour was his return journey to the United States. The introduction is by Lawrence F. Abbott, who was editor of The Outlook, a magazine with which Roosevelt was closely associated.
