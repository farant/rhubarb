Notes = """
"Ship's Company" was published in 1922. W.W. Jacobs (1863-1943) was a prolific writer of short stories, primarily known for his humorous tales of dockside and maritime life, though he also wrote supernatural fiction. While Jacobs was writing during a period when England was still predominantly Christian, his works are secular comedies of manners and social situations rather than religious literature, so this does not receive a 'catholic' tag.
