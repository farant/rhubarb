Oliver Onions (1873-1961) was a British novelist and short story writer. While he wrote in various genres, he is primarily remembered today for his supernatural fiction. "The Beckoning Fair One" from this collection has been anthologized extensively and influenced later horror writers. The work is not appropriate for young children due to its mature psychological horror themes.
