Summary = """

Notes = """
Year is straightforward as this was delivered and published in 1900. James A.H. Murray (1837-1915) was the primary editor of the Oxford English Dictionary and one of the most important lexicographers in history. The Romanes Lecture is a prestigious annual lecture series established at Oxford in 1892. This is an academic lecture, not appropriate for children due to its specialized scholarly nature. Not tagged as 'catholic' as Murray was Scottish Presbyterian, though he was a deeply learned and principled scholar.
