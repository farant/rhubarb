Summary = """
This is a biographical work about James Oglethorpe (1696-1785), the British soldier, philanthropist, and founder of the colony of Georgia in 1733. Written by Thaddeus Mason Harris, a distinguished scholar and member of multiple historical societies, this book documents Oglethorpe's life and his role in establishing Georgia as both a humanitarian refuge for debtors and a strategic buffer colony between British Carolina and Spanish Florida. The work was dedicated to the Georgia Historical Society and reflects 19th-century American interest in documenting the lives of colonial founders.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1841 is taken directly from the title page (shown in Roman numerals as MDCCCXLI). This is a 19th-century biographical treatment of an 18th-century historical figure, not a primary source document from Oglethorpe's own time. Harris was a well-credentialed historian, as evidenced by his membership in numerous academic societies including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and multiple historical societies.
