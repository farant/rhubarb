Summary = """
"At Sunwich Port" is a novel by W. W. Jacobs, an English author known for his humorous short stories and novels about working-class life, particularly involving sailors and dockside communities. This work is set in the fictional English coastal town of Sunwich Port and follows the romantic and social complications of various characters in this maritime community. Jacobs was a master of gentle comedy and character-driven narratives, and this novel exemplifies his skill at depicting small-town English life with warmth and wit. The story typically involves romantic entanglements, misunderstandings, and the social dynamics of a port town in the early 20th century.
