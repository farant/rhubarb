Summary = """
Notes and Queries was a weekly British periodical founded in 1849 by William John Thoms. It served as a correspondence forum for scholars, antiquaries, literary researchers, and historians to pose questions, share discoveries, and exchange information on matters of literary, historical, and genealogical interest. The publication featured a distinctive format of notes (brief scholarly observations), queries (questions seeking answers from readers), and replies (answers to previously published queries). This issue (No. 25) from April 20, 1850 includes discussions on Roger Bacon, Pope's revision of Spence, folk lore including Easter eggs and toothache charms, and the Duke of Monmouth's pocket-book. The journal's motto "When found, make a note of" comes from Captain Cuttle in Dickens's Dombey and Son.
