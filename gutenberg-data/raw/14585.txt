Summary = """
This is a case study document produced by ERPANET (Electronic Resource Preservation and Access Network), a European Union-funded project that ran from 2001-2004. The document analyzes Project Gutenberg as a case study in digital preservation practices. It covers topics such as awareness of digital preservation issues, preservation activities, compliance monitoring, costs, and future outlook for digital text archives. This is essentially a meta-document: a study about digital preservation that happens to be preserved on the very platform it studies.
