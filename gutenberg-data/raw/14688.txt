Summary = """
Un Hiver à Majorque (A Winter in Majorca) is a travel memoir by the French novelist George Sand (Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin, 1804-1876). The book recounts her stay on the Spanish island of Majorca during the winter of 1838-1839 with her two children and her lover, the Polish composer Frédéric Chopin, who was suffering from tuberculosis. The work is both a travelogue describing Majorcan landscape, customs, and people, and an intimate account of their difficult sojourn—marked by Chopin's illness, the hostility of local inhabitants, and their eventual retreat to the abandoned Carthusian monastery of Valldemossa. Sand's observations are characteristically sharp, sometimes critical of Majorcan society, and the book remains a classic of 19th-century travel literature.
