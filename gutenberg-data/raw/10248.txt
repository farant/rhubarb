Notes = """
"Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gives to Me" was composed by Charles McCarron (lyrics) and Carey Morgan (music) and published in 1919. This recording by Raderman's Jazz Orchestra would have been made in approximately the same period, during the early years of jazz recordings. The date 1919 reflects the original composition and likely recording period, though exact recording dates from Edison's laboratory can sometimes vary. This is an audio artifact rather than a text, so traditional fields like "appropriate-for-children" or "fiction/non-fiction" don't apply in the usual sense - it's a historical audio document of early jazz music.
