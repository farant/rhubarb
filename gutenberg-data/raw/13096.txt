Summary = """
This is a biographical tribute to Charles-Michel de Salaberry (1778-1829), the French-Canadian military officer who commanded the Canadian Voltigeurs at the Battle of Châteauguay on October 26, 1813. In that battle, Salaberry led a force of approximately 300 Canadian militiamen and Indigenous warriors to repel an American invasion force of several thousand troops during the War of 1812. The work, written by Laurent-Olivier David, is a patriotic celebration of Salaberry as a symbol of French-Canadian military valor, comparing him favorably to legendary French knights and warriors like Bayard, Du Guesclin, and the crusaders. David was a prominent Quebec journalist, politician, and historian who wrote extensively on French-Canadian national figures.
