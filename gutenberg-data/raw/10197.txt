Summary = """
This is an audio recording of the traditional gospel hymn "He Was Nailed to the Cross for Me" performed by Ernest V. Stoneman, a pioneering country and gospel musician from Virginia. Stoneman was one of the earliest country music recording artists, and this recording was made for Edison Records. The song is a devotional piece reflecting on Christ's crucifixion.
"""

Notes = """
Ernest Stoneman recorded prolifically for Edison Records in the late 1920s. The spelling "Earnest" in the Gutenberg metadata appears to be an error; the artist's name was Ernest V. Stoneman (1893-1968). The year 1927 is chosen as this aligns with Stoneman's peak recording period for Edison. This is an audio file rather than a text, preserved from the Edison National Historic Site collection.
