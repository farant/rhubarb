Summary = """
'The Understudy' is a short story by W.W. Jacobs, part of his 1914 collection 'Night Watches.' Jacobs was a popular English author known for his humorous tales of dockside and seafaring life.

Jacobs' work is characterized by its gentle humor, working-class characters, and vivid depictions of life around the London docks and English waterways. While he's best remembered today for his horror story 'The Monkey's Paw,' the bulk of his work consisted of these lighthearted maritime tales.
