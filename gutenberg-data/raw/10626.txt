Summary = """
A literary essay published in The Atlantic Monthly examining the tradition of the laurel crown (laureateship) in English poetry from Geoffrey Chaucer through Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The piece traces the historical and mythological significance of the laurel as a symbol of poetic achievement, exploring how this classical tradition was adopted and transformed in English literary culture.

Notes = """
This is a periodical article from the early years of The Atlantic Monthly (founded 1857). The year 1858 reflects the publication date, which is the appropriate date for this work since it is an original essay rather than a republication. Many articles in mid-19th century literary magazines were published anonymously, which was common practice at the time.
