This is clearly not a single authored literary work, but rather an issue of a periodical magazine called "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction" from October 27, 1827. It appears to be a Victorian-era magazine that published miscellaneous content, including this article about Elsinore (spelled "Elsineur" in the text) and its connection to Shakespeare's Hamlet.
