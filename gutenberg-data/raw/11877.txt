Summary = """
A collection of illustrated children's stories edited by Palmer Cox, a prominent Canadian-American illustrator and author of the late 19th century. Cox was best known for creating "The Brownies" series of illustrated books and magazines. This collection features stories written in verse, including the titular story "Monkey Jack" about a brave boy who climbs a tree to retrieve a little girl's ball.

Notes = """
The exact publication year is estimated at 1895 based on Palmer Cox's most active publishing period and the Project Gutenberg cataloging. Cox's works were primarily published between 1880-1910, with the bulk of his collections appearing in the 1890s. The note in the text references HTML versions with "original illustrations," which was typical of Cox's heavily illustrated children's books. This is not a Catholic work - Cox was of Protestant background and his works were secular children's literature.
