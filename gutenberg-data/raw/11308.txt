Based on the text you provided from Project Gutenberg #11308, I can analyze this work:

The title page clearly states "THE BOOK OF ENTERPRISE & ADVENTURE; BEING AN EXCITEMENT TO READING. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE." This appears to be an anthology/collection published in London in 1851, illustrated by Absalon. The preface indicates this is a collection of selected pieces meant to inspire young readers with "heroic enthusiasm" and teach them to "despise danger."

This type of Victorian-era youth anthology was common in the mid-19th century. Without seeing the full table of contents or the complete work, I cannot identify a single author - these were typically compiled by an editor (often anonymous) who selected exciting adventure stories, historical accounts, and morally uplifting tales from various sources.

Notes = """
Year chosen is 1851 as stated on the title page - this appears to be a "new and condensed edition" suggesting there may have been earlier editions. These Victorian anthologies typically compiled stories from multiple sources and authors, edited for young audiences.
