It seems the file has issues. Let me check what you provided in your message - you included the text directly. Based on what you've shown me, I can identify this work:

This is **"La Espuma"** by **Armando Palacio Valdés**, a Spanish novelist. The text clearly states it's from his complete works (Obras Completas) and indicates this is from Tomo VII (Volume 7), published in 1922 (as noted in the header).

"La Espuma" (which translates to "The Foam" or "The Froth") was originally published in **1890-1891**. It's a realist novel that satirizes the superficial high society of Madrid during the Restoration period. The 1922 date shown is likely a later edition of his complete works, but the original publication is what matters for your historical timeline.

Armando Palacio Valdés (1853-1938) was a Spanish realist novelist and critic, though not specifically a Catholic author in the sense you've defined (writing works with nihil obstat/imprimatur).

Summary = """
La Espuma (The Foam/The Froth) is a realist novel by Spanish author Armando Palacio Valdés that satirizes the superficial, materialistic high society of Madrid during the Spanish Restoration period. The novel depicts the aristocracy and upper bourgeoisie as empty and frivolous - like foam or froth - lacking substance beneath their elegant appearances. It's considered one of Palacio Valdés's major works and exemplifies Spanish literary realism of the late 19th century.

Notes = """
The text shows this is from a 1922 edition of the author's complete works (Obras Completas, Tomo VII), but the novel was originally published in 1890-1891. I've used 1891 as the primary publication year for historical timeline purposes, as this represents when the work first appeared and had its cultural impact.
