Summary = """
Punch was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire established in 1841, running until 1992 (with a brief revival 1996-2002). It was enormously influential in Victorian and Edwardian Britain, coining terms like "cartoon" in its modern sense. This issue is from Volume 101, published November 14th, 1891. The excerpt shows "Letters to Abstractions No. VI - To Vanity," a satirical piece written as a letter addressing the personified concept of Vanity, in the style of moral commentary popular in the period. Punch was known for its wit, political cartoons, and social commentary, often poking fun at Victorian society's pretensions.
"""

Notes = """
Punch is a periodical rather than a single-authored work. The specific contributors to individual pieces were often anonymous or used pseudonyms. The year 1891 is the publication date of this specific issue.
