I recognize this as "The Moon Rock" by Arthur J. Rees. This is a mystery/detective novel published in 1922, which appears to be a first edition given the copyright notice at the beginning of the text. Arthur J. Rees was a British-Australian crime fiction writer who collaborated with John R. Watson on several mystery novels and also wrote independently. This particular work is a standalone mystery novel set in Cornwall, England, featuring detective elements and Gothic atmosphere characteristic of early 20th-century British mystery fiction.
