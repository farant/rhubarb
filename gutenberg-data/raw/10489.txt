I'll analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the work and provide the requested information.

This is clearly an anthology/collection rather than a single authored work. The text is "An English Garner: Critical Essays and Literary Fragments" edited with an introduction by J. Churton Collins, published in 1903. This is a republication/rearrangement of Professor Edward Arber's original 8-volume "English Garner" series (1877-1890).

The collection contains critical essays and literary fragments from various authors spanning from 1554 to 1807, including works by Thomas Wilson, Sir Philip Sidney, Francis Meres, John Dryden, Sir Robert Howard, Thomas Ellwood, Bishop Copleston, and others (the Bickerstaff/Partridge tracts, Gay, Tickell, and Steele).

Summary = """
This is a collected anthology of English critical essays and literary fragments, spanning from the 16th to early 19th centuries. Originally compiled by Professor Edward Arber in 8 volumes (1877-1890), this 1903 edition was rearranged and reclassified under the editorial supervision of Thomas Seccombe with new introductions by J. Churton Collins. The volume includes significant works of literary criticism and commentary, including Thomas Wilson's Art of Rhetoric (1554), Sir Philip Sidney's letter to his brother (1580), John Dryden's influential Essay of Dramatic Poesy (1668), and various other critical works. The collection represents an important compilation of English literary criticism and provides insight into the development of critical thought across several centuries.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1903 is chosen as this represents the publication date of this particular edition with new introductions by J. Churton Collins. While the original Arber series was published 1877-1890, this rearranged and enhanced edition represents a distinct scholarly work. The contents themselves span 1554-1807, but as an anthology, the relevant publication date is when this collection was assembled and published.
