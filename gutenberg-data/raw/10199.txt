This appears to be an audio recording rather than a text document - it's an MP3 file from the Edison National Historic Site, not a traditional book. "Down in a Georgia Jail" is a folk song/ballad that was recorded in the early 20th century. Based on the Edison connection and the nature of early phonograph recordings, this would likely be from around 1900-1920.

However, this is a tricky case because:
1. It's an audio recording, not a written work
2. The song itself (as folk material) predates any specific recording
3. Posey Rorer was a musician who recorded for Edison Records

Given that this is an audio artifact rather than a literary work, and folk songs don't have clear publication dates, I'll provide my best assessment:

<result>
Title = "Down in a Georgia Jail"
Author = "Posey Rorer (performer)"
Year = 1924

Summary = """
This is an audio recording of the American folk song "Down in a Georgia Jail" performed by Posey Rorer, preserved at the Edison National Historic Site. Rorer was a country musician who recorded for Thomas Edison's record company in the 1920s. The song is a traditional folk ballad about imprisonment, typical of the rural Southern musical tradition of the era. This represents an early example of commercially recorded American folk music.
"""

Notes = """
The exact recording date is uncertain, but Posey Rorer recorded for Edison Records primarily in the 1920s. The year chosen (1924) represents the approximate period of Edison cylinder and disc recordings of folk material. As an audio artifact rather than a written text, the "publication" date refers to the recording date rather than composition date of the folk song itself, which would be earlier and uncertain.
