I need to analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the title, author, year, and other metadata.

Looking at the text, I can see this is written in Serbian Cyrillic. The title page clearly shows:

- Title: "СЕКУНД ВЕЧНОСТИ" (Sekund večnosti / A Second of Eternity)
- Subtitle: "ИСТОЧЊАЧКИ РОМАН" (Istočnjački roman / Oriental Novel)
- Author: "ДРАГУТИНА Ј. ИЛИЈЋА" (Dragutina J. Ilijića / by Dragutin J. Ilić)
- Publication year shown: 1921
- Publisher: Zdravko Spasojević bookstore, Belgrade

This is a work by Serbian author Dragutin Ilić (1858-1926), a Serbian writer, journalist, and politician. "A Second of Eternity" is one of his novels with an Oriental/mystical theme, set in India and dealing with Hindu philosophy and mysticism. The text describes a guru named Ramaswamy at a monastery in the Himalayas.
