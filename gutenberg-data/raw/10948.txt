Notes = """
The year 1889 is clearly indicated in the original publication information from the text itself. Frank R. Stockton (1834-1902) was a Protestant American writer, so the 'catholic' tag is not applicable. His work is generally considered appropriate for children and family audiences, featuring moral lessons delivered through entertaining and non-violent narratives.
