The book features illustrated versions of beloved children's stories, making classic tales accessible to young readers of the early 20th century. 'Little Red Riding Hood' itself is one of the most enduring European fairy tales, telling the story of a young girl who encounters a wolf on her way to visit her grandmother.

Notes = """
The year 1922 reflects this specific compilation's publication date. While 'Little Red Riding Hood' as a tale has much older origins (Perrault 1697, Grimm 1812), this is a 20th-century children's book collection, so the compilation date is most appropriate for cataloging purposes.
