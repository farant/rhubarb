Title = "These United States Population Statistics"
Author = "Michael S. Hart"
Year = 1993

Tags = ["non-fiction", "reference", "statistics"]

Summary = """
A statistical reference document providing US Census Bureau population figures and explaining how to interpret population statistics in conjunction with economic data. The document discusses growth rates, explains the methodology for estimates, and provides guidance on properly evaluating educational and economic reports by accounting for population growth - similar to how one would account for inflation when comparing monetary figures across time periods.
"""

Notes = """
This appears to be an early Project Gutenberg publication by Michael Hart (founder of Project Gutenberg). The 1993 date is based on internal references to "1992 was an estimate" and "the file 'price10.txt' released in 1993." This is an original work created for Project Gutenberg rather than a republication of an earlier text. Given its nature as a statistical reference and the low Gutenberg ID number (115), this is likely one of Hart's personal contributions to the early digital library.
