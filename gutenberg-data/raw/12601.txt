Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical published in the early 19th century (1822-1849). It featured illustrated articles on a wide variety of subjects including architecture, natural history, travel, science, literature, and current events. This particular issue from January 7, 1832 focuses on the Surrey Zoological Gardens, including engravings of entrance lodges and buildings, along with commentary on the garden's design and layout. The magazine was known for its fine engravings and accessible writing style, making it suitable for family reading and education.

Notes = """
The year 1832 is straightforward as this is the actual publication date printed in the periodical. These weekly magazines were contemporary publications reporting on current events and places of interest. The Surrey Zoological Gardens opened in 1831, so this article was reporting on a very new attraction in London. As a periodical, authorship was collective ('Various' contributors), which was typical for such publications.
