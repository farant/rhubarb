Summary = """
'The Wise Mamma Goose' is an early 20th-century children's picture book by Charlotte B. Herr with illustrations by Frances Beem. The story follows Mamma Goose, a proud mother of twelve fluffy yellow goslings, as she tries to solve a mysterious problem in the barnyard. Something has been coming at night and carrying away chickens, and Mamma Goose is worried about the safety of her beloved babies. The narrative emphasizes Mamma Goose's maternal pride in her goslings, who can swim and find their own food better than the chickens of little Red Hen. The story appears to be a gentle mystery tale designed for young children, with the characteristic anthropomorphic barnyard animals common to children's literature of this period.
