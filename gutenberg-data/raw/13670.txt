"The Happy Family" is a Western novel by B.M. Bower (pen name of Bertha Muzzy Sinclair), one of the most prolific and popular authors of Western fiction in the early 20th century. The book is part of her "Flying U" series, which follows the adventures of cowboys on a Montana ranch.

The "Happy Family" refers to the colorful group of cowboys who work together and get into various scrapes and adventures.
