Notes = """
The year 1829 is taken directly from the publication date shown on the title page. This is a periodical compilation rather than a single-authored work, so "Various" is listed as the author with J. Limbird noted as editor/publisher. The magazine ran from approximately 1822-1849, making this a mid-period volume from the publication's run.
