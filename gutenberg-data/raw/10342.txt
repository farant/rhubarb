Notes = """
Henry Seton Merriman (Hugh Stowell Scott, 1862-1903) was a prolific novelist whose works were widely read in his time. 'The Velvet Glove' was published in 1901, two years before his death. The phrase "the velvet glove" traditionally refers to the idiom "an iron fist in a velvet glove," suggesting gentle appearance masking firm control or force, which likely reflects themes in the novel. While Merriman was a popular writer of his era, his works are less well-known today compared to his contemporary adventure writers.
