Notes = """
Thomas Seltzer (1875-1943) was a Russian-born American translator and publisher who did much to introduce Russian literature to English-speaking audiences. This anthology was first published in 1917 by Boni and Liveright. The individual stories span roughly 1834 (Pushkin's "Queen of Spades") to the early 1900s (Gorky's works), but the anthology itself as a compiled work dates to 1917.
