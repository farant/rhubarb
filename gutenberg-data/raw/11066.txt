Summary = """
This is a scholarly article published in the academic journal Modern Philology examining Graf Otto Heinrich von Loeben (1786-1825), a minor German Romantic poet, and his connection to the Lorelei legend. The article explores how Loeben, despite being a prolific but ultimately unsuccessful poet who never achieved lasting fame, played a role in the development of the famous Lorelei legend - the story of the siren on the Rhine who lured sailors to their doom. Porterfield situates Loeben among the German Romantic poets, discussing his literary connections and his place in the history of this particular German folklore motif that was later immortalized by Heinrich Heine.
