Summary = """
'Children of the Ghetto' is Israel Zangwill's groundbreaking novel and social study of Jewish immigrant life in the East End of London during the late 19th century. Published in 1892, it was one of the first works to authentically portray the lives, struggles, and culture of Eastern European Jewish immigrants in England. The book combines realistic fiction with ethnographic observation, depicting the tensions between traditional Jewish life and assimilation into English society. Zangwill, himself the son of Jewish immigrants, wrote with intimate knowledge of ghetto life, incorporating Yiddish dialogue and Hebrew terms to capture the authentic voice of his subjects. The work was hugely influential in bringing Jewish immigrant experience into mainstream English literature and remains a valuable historical document of Anglo-Jewish life in the Victorian era.

Notes = """
The original publication was in 1892 (first edition), with this preface dated March 1893 referring to the third edition. I chose 1892 as the historically significant year since that's when the work first appeared and made its cultural impact. While Zangwill was Jewish, this is a novel rather than a specifically Catholic work, so I did not include the 'catholic' tag. I also did not include 'appropriate-for-children' as this is a serious social novel dealing with adult themes of poverty, immigration, and cultural conflict, though it contains no explicit content.
