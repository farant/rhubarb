Summary = """
"Lehtori Hellmanin vaimo" (The Lecturer Hellman's Wife) is a novel by Minna Canth, one of Finland's most important 19th-century authors and a pioneering figure in Finnish realism and naturalism. Canth was known for her sharp social criticism, particularly regarding women's rights and class inequality. This work, like many of her others, likely explores themes of marriage, women's social position, and the constraints placed on women in Finnish society during the late 1800s. The opening scene depicts young seminary students preparing for an outing, with the character Anni Kemppainen helping her friend Selma Varén with her dress—a quiet domestic moment that introduces the female relationships and daily life central to Canth's social realist style.
