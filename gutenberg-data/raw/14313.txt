Summary = """
This is a historical adventure novel by G. A. Henty, the prolific Victorian author known for his boys' adventure stories set against historical backdrops. The story follows a young protagonist through adventures by land and sea during the Napoleonic Wars, culminating around the Battle of Waterloo (1815). As Henty notes in his preface, while a boy is the main character, the true heroine is a woman whose courage and nerve equal that of any soldier. Henty uses the preface to make a characteristically progressive point about female courage, arguing that women are often braver than men in moments of true danger.
