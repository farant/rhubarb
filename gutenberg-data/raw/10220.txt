"Daddy Takes Us Skating" is part of Howard R. Garis's popular "Daddy" series of children's books, which followed the Blake family - Daddy, Mother, and children Hal and Mab - through various seasonal adventures and everyday activities. In this installment, the children experience winter activities, particularly ice skating. Garis was a prolific American author who wrote for the Stratemeyer Syndicate and created the beloved Uncle Wiggily character. His "Daddy" series was designed to entertain children while gently teaching them about the world around them through the patient explanations of their father and their own discoveries. The books were characterized by simple, engaging narratives suitable for early readers and featured wholesome family values typical of early 20th century children's literature.
