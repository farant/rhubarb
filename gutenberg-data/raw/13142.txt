Notes = """
1922 is the publication year as stated on the title page of the Gutenberg text itself. L. W. Rogers (1859-1953) was a prolific Theosophical writer and lecturer. Theosophy, while drawing on various religious traditions including some Christian mysticism, is a syncretic spiritual movement founded by Helena Blavatsky and is not aligned with Catholic teaching - hence no 'catholic' tag. The work is not marked 'appropriate-for-children' as it deals with abstract philosophical concepts aimed at adult readers.
