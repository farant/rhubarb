Notes = """
The first edition of 'The Little Book of Modern Verse' was published in 1913 by Houghton Mifflin. This anthology was quite popular and went through multiple editions and printings. Jessie B. Rittenhouse (1869-1948) was a significant figure in early 20th-century American poetry circles, serving as the first secretary of the Poetry Society of America. The anthology is not a Catholic work - it's a secular literary collection representing the broader American and British poetic traditions of the modern period.
