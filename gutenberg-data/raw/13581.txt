Summary = """
A collection of three Finnish short stories/novellas by Juhani Aho, a pioneering figure in Finnish literature and one of the founders of Finnish literary realism. The title story "Hellmannin herra" (The Master of Hellmanni) opens with a vivid scene of a tyrannical household master terrorizing his wife, servants, and farmhands as he prepares to visit the village. Aho's work characteristically depicts Finnish rural and provincial life with psychological depth and social observation, often examining power dynamics, class relations, and the tensions of Finnish society during the transition from Swedish rule to independence.
"""

Notes = """
Juhani Aho (born Johannes Brofeldt, 1861-1921) was a Lutheran Finnish author. This 1920 WSOY edition appears to be a late collection. While Aho is an important cultural figure, his works are secular fiction without Catholic orientation.
