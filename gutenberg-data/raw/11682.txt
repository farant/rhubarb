Summary = """
'The Soul of the War' is the first volume of Philip Gibbs' war memoirs from World War I. Gibbs was one of the few officially accredited British war correspondents allowed on the British sector of the Western Front. Published in 1915, this book covers his experiences and observations from the beginning of the war through 1915, including mobilization, the German invasion of Belgium, the French and British military response, and the defense of Paris. The book is notable for its vivid eyewitness accounts and helped shape British public understanding of the war. Together with his later volume 'Now It Can Be Told' (1920), Gibbs' memoirs became highly influential in shaping the "Lost Generation" narrative of the 1920s.
