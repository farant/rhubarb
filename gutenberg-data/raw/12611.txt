"""

Notes = """
The year 1913 is taken directly from the title page and represents the original publication date. Arnold Bennett (1867-1931) was not a Catholic author - he came from a Methodist background and later became agnostic/secular in outlook. Therefore, the 'catholic' tag is not applied. The work is sophisticated adult fiction dealing with business and romantic themes, making it not particularly appropriate for children.
