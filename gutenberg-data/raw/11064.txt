Notes = """
"Andromeda and Other Poems" was first published in 1858. While Kingsley was an Anglican clergyman (not Catholic), the work itself is primarily classical and nature poetry without sectarian content, hence no 'catholic' tag. The poems are generally appropriate for older children and young adults, dealing with mythological and pastoral themes typical of Victorian poetry.
