Summary = """
The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is one of Beatrix Potter's beloved children's stories featuring anthropomorphic animals. The story follows a little girl named Lucie who loses her pocket-handkerchiefs and goes searching for them, eventually discovering Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, a hedgehog washerwoman who does laundry for all the animals. Like Potter's other works, it combines charming illustrations with gentle storytelling aimed at young children. The character of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was inspired by Potter's own pet hedgehog and by Kitty MacDonald, a Scottish washerwoman. This is one of the classic "little books" in Potter's Peter Rabbit series that has remained continuously in print and beloved by generations of children.
