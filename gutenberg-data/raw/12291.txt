I recognize this as "The Teacher" by Jacob Abbott, a highly influential 19th-century work on educational philosophy and pedagogy. Let me provide the structured information:

Title = "The Teacher; or, Moral Influences Employed in the Instruction and Government of the Young"
Author = "Jacob Abbott"
Year = 1833

Tags = ["non-fiction", "appropriate-for-children"]

Summary = """
'The Teacher' is one of Jacob Abbott's most influential educational works, presenting a systematic approach to classroom management and instruction based on moral influence rather than harsh discipline. Abbott (1803-1879) was a pioneering American educator, Congregationalist minister, and prolific author who founded the Mount Vernon School for Young Ladies in Boston. This book became a foundational text in teacher training and represented a progressive shift toward understanding child psychology and employing gentler, more rational methods of instruction. Abbott advocated for treating students with respect, appealing to their reason and conscience, and creating an organized system of school management. His educational philosophy influenced American pedagogy throughout the 19th century and helped professionalize the teaching occupation. Abbott is also famous for writing the Rollo books, a popular series of children's literature.

Notes = """
The text shows this is a revised edition from 1873 (as stated on the title page), but the work was originally published in 1833. I chose 1833 as the Year because that represents the historical moment when Abbott's educational philosophy first entered the public discourse and began influencing American pedagogy. The 1873 edition represents a later revision, but the work's historical and educational significance dates to the original publication. The copyright notice shows 1856, which may represent another revised edition between the original and this 1873 printing.
