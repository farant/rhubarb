The year 1827 is the publication date clearly stated in the header of this specific issue. George Canning served as Prime Minister for only 119 days before his death in August 1827, making this a contemporary account of a significant historical event. The Mirror was published from 1822-1849 and was one of the first popular illustrated magazines in Britain.
