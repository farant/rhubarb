A novel by Alice Duer Miller set in early 20th century New York society. The story centers on Miss Severance (referred to as "little Miss Severance") and appears to explore themes of romance, friendship, and the social world of upper-class New York.

Notes = """
1918 is the original publication year as indicated on the title page. Alice Duer Miller was not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag has been omitted. The work appears to be mainstream fiction appropriate for general audiences including older children/young adults, given its domestic and romantic themes typical of the era's popular literature."""
