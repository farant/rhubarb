Summary = """
'At Sunwich Port' is a humorous novel by W. W. Jacobs set in an English seaside town. The story revolves around Captain Nugent, his son's impending marriage, and the persistent visits of Jem Hardy, who appears to be pursuing some undisclosed objective despite the captain's resistance. Jacobs is known for his light comedic touch and vivid characterizations of English working-class and maritime life. This work exemplifies his skill at depicting the social dynamics and comic misunderstandings of small-town life, with particular attention to stubborn sea captains and the romantic entanglements of their families. The novel was illustrated by Will Owen, whose drawings complemented Jacobs's narrative style.
"""

Notes = """
First published in 1902. W. W. Jacobs was a popular author of his era, and while he was English and writing in the Edwardian period, there's no indication this is a specifically Catholic work. The 'appropriate-for-children' tag applies as Jacobs's humor was generally wholesome and his novels were suitable family reading of the period.
