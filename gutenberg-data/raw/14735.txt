Summary = """
This is a volume from the Home University Library of Modern Knowledge series, examining the development of English political philosophy from John Locke (late 17th century) through Jeremy Bentham (early 19th century). Harold Laski was a prominent British political theorist and economist who later became chairman of the British Labour Party. This work traces the intellectual evolution of liberal political thought during a crucial period that saw the Glorious Revolution, the American and French Revolutions, and the rise of utilitarianism. Laski acknowledges his debt to Leslie Stephen's monumental 'History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century' as a foundational source.

Notes = """
1920 is the publication date shown on the title page. This is an original scholarly work by Laski, not a translation or reprint of an older text, so the publication year is the appropriate date.
