Summary = """
'Through the Iron Bars' is a firsthand account of the German occupation of Belgium during World War I, covering the first two years of occupation from 1914-1916. Written by Emile Cammaerts, a Belgian poet, playwright, and author who was living in England during the war, the work documents the suffering, oppression, and resistance of the Belgian people under German military rule. The book includes illustrations by Dutch artist Louis Raemaekers, whose anti-German political cartoons became famous during WWI. Cammaerts provides a detailed chronicle of German atrocities, economic exploitation, forced labor, and the systematic destruction of Belgian society and culture during the occupation.
"""

Notes = """
The publication date of 1917 (MCMXVII in Roman numerals) is clearly indicated on the title page. This is the original publication year. The book was published during the war while Belgium was still occupied, making it contemporary wartime testimony rather than retrospective history. Emile Cammaerts was a respected Belgian writer who spent the war years in England, where he became a prominent spokesman for the Belgian cause and worked to document German war crimes.
