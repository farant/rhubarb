Summary = """

Notes = """
1903 is the original publication year, clearly stated on the title page. Mary Austin was not Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag is not included. The work is generally appropriate for older children and young adults due to its accessible prose and educational content about nature and geography, though it is primarily adult non-fiction.
