Summary = """
"Il Tenente dei Lancieri" (The Lieutenant of the Lancers) is a novel by Gerolamo Rovetta, a prominent Italian writer of the late 19th century known for his realistic portrayals of Milanese bourgeois society. The novel opens with the introduction of the Monghisoni-Trebeschi family, centered on the domineering Signora Maddalena, a shrewd businesswoman who runs her father's wholesale provisions shop in Milan's Via Lentasio. Rovetta was known for his satirical and sometimes critical depictions of the Italian middle class during the post-unification period, exploring themes of commerce, social ambition, and family dynamics.
