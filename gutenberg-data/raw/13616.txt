Summary = """
This is Volume III of a monumental 55-volume scholarly compilation of primary source documents relating to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines. The series collects and translates contemporaneous letters, reports, royal decrees, missionary accounts, and other documents from Spanish, Portuguese, and other European archives. This particular volume covers the years 1569-1576, including correspondence from early Spanish officials like Guido de Lavezaris and Miguel López de Legazpi to King Felipe II, accounts of the voyage to Luzon, and the formal act of taking possession of Manila in 1570. The work documents the political, economic, commercial, and religious conditions during the early Spanish colonization, with particular attention to the Catholic missions.
"""

Notes = """
The original documents date from 1569-1576, but the compilation and scholarly edition was published beginning in 1903 by Arthur H. Clark Company in Cleveland, Ohio. I chose 1903 as this represents the editorial work of Blair, Robertson, and Bourne who translated, annotated, and organized these primary sources into a coherent scholarly edition. The original documents themselves are historical records from the 16th century Spanish colonial administration. This series remains an essential primary source collection for Philippine colonial history.
