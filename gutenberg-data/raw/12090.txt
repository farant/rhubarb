I need to examine this text more carefully to identify the specific work. Let me read through what's provided.

This appears to be a contents page from "The Lives of the Poets of Great-Britain and Ireland" by Theophilus Cibber (and other contributors). The text shows Volume V from 1753 (M DCC LIII in Roman numerals).

This is a biographical reference work containing lives/biographies of various English and Irish poets. Theophilus Cibber was the primary compiler, though he had assistance from other writers (notably Robert Shiels). The work was published in multiple volumes in the 1750s.

The original publication was 1753 based on the title page shown. This is a significant 18th-century biographical reference work about British literary figures.

Summary = """
A multi-volume biographical reference work documenting the lives of British and Irish poets. Compiled primarily by Theophilus Cibber (son of Colley Cibber, the Poet Laureate) with contributions from other writers including Robert Shiels. This fifth volume continues the alphabetical biographical entries covering poets from various periods. The work was an important 18th-century literary reference that provided biographical information and critical assessments of English-language poets up to that time.
"""

Notes = """
Year chosen is 1753, the publication date shown on the title page (M DCC LIII). This is the original publication year of this volume. While Cibber's name appears first, modern scholarship has revealed that much of the actual writing was done by Robert Shiels, Samuel Johnson's amanuensis, though Cibber served as the nominal editor and author.
