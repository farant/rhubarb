Summary = """
"The Death of Balder" (Danish: "Balders Død") is a tragic drama by Danish poet Johannes Ewald, considered one of the masterpieces of Danish Golden Age literature. The play draws on Norse mythology, dramatizing the death of the god Balder, son of Odin, who is killed through the machinations of Loki. Ewald's work helped establish Danish as a literary language and is notable for its lyrical verse. This English translation by George Borrow, the eccentric Victorian author known for his travel writings and linguistic abilities, was published posthumously in 1889.
