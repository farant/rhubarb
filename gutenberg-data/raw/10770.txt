I can help you identify this work. Let me analyze the text.

This is clearly a compilation/anthology edited by Austin Craig about the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. The preface mentions it contains works by various foreign observers including the German scientist Jagor, the Spanish writer Comyn, and references to Antonio de Morga's 1609 history. It also extensively discusses José Rizal's writings and his opposition to Spanish colonial narratives.

Based on the title "The Former Philippines Thru Foreign Eyes" and the Project Gutenberg number 10770, this appears to be a collection of historical documents and observations by non-Spanish (or reform-minded Spanish) writers about the Philippines, compiled and edited by Austin Craig in the early 20th century (likely around 1916 based on when Craig was active in the Philippines).

Summary = """
A compilation of historical writings about the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period, edited by Austin Craig. The collection includes works by foreign observers and liberal Spanish writers who provided alternative perspectives to the dominant Spanish colonial narratives. The anthology appears to include writings by German scientist Fedor Jagor, Spanish economist Tomás de Comyn, and references to Antonio de Morga's 1609 history. The preface discusses how Spanish colonial writers systematically diminished the achievements and capabilities of Filipinos, and how José Rizal countered these narratives through his scholarly works. This collection serves as a corrective to Spanish colonial historiography by presenting accounts from more objective foreign observers.
