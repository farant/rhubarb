Notes = """
Anna Katharine Green's "A Strange Disappearance" was first published in 1880, two years after her groundbreaking debut "The Leavenworth Case" (1878) which established her reputation. Green was writing during the Victorian era and her mysteries were considered respectable reading, appropriate for all audiences. She was not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag is not included, though her works were generally moral and suitable for family reading.
