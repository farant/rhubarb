Summary = """
Dew Drops was a weekly children's Sunday school paper published by David C. Cook Publishing Company. This issue contains a story called "Francie Fisher's Fish" by Marion Mallette Thornton, about a young boy named Francie who wants to bring a new child to his Sunday school class. The Sunday school has a visual reward system where fish are pinned to a picture of a river for each new scholar recruited. Francie eventually finds a potential recruit in the ash-man's son, a little Italian-American boy named (presumably) from the Lugi family.

Notes = """
David C. Cook Publishing Company was (and still is) a Protestant Christian publisher, not Catholic. While the content is wholesome children's Christian literature, it would not have a nihil obstat or imprimatur. The 'christian' tag is used rather than 'catholic' to reflect its Protestant Sunday school origins.
