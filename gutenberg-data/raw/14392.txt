Summary = """
This is a biographical and critical study of George du Maurier (1834-1896), the Anglo-French artist and author who became one of the most celebrated cartoonists and social satirists of Victorian England. Du Maurier is best known for his illustrations in Punch magazine, where he lampooned the pretensions of Victorian society, and for his novels, particularly "Trilby" (1894), which introduced the character of Svengali and became a sensation. T. Martin Wood examines du Maurier's artistic career, his distinctive style of social commentary through illustration, and his personality. The book includes forty-one illustrations of du Maurier's work.
