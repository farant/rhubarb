Summary = """
This is an official publication of the United States Copyright Office listing copyright renewal registrations for books, pamphlets, serials, and periodical contributions during the second half of 1961. It serves as a legal record and reference document, arranged alphabetically by author or issuing body. Each entry contains information about both the original copyright registration and the renewal registration. These catalogs are important historical documents for tracking intellectual property and publication history in the United States.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1961 is definitively correct as this is the publication year of this specific catalog volume. This is administrative/archival material rather than creative or scholarly work. Not appropriate for children (reference material). Not a Catholic work (government document).

This is an unusual Project Gutenberg entry since it's a government catalog rather than a literary or scholarly work. If you're building a timeline of historical works, you might want to handle government documents and reference catalogs differently from traditional literature, philosophy, theology, etc.
