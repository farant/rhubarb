Hmm, let me check what file you're referring to. The text you've pasted appears to be from Punch magazine, Vol. 156, January 29, 1919.

Title = "Punch, or The London Charivari, Vol. 156, January 29, 1919"
Author = "Various"
Year = 1919

Tags = ["fiction", "periodical", "satire", "humor"]

Summary = """
Punch, or The London Charivari, was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire established in 1841. This issue from January 1919 comes from the immediate post-WWI period, with topical humor about the Paris Peace Conference, Kaiser Wilhelm II's exile in the Netherlands (where he had fled after abdication in November 1918), Irish republican Éamon de Valera, and everyday London life like overcrowded Tube trains. The magazine was known for its wit, political cartoons, and gentle satire of British society and politics. It ran continuously until 1992, with a brief revival in the late 1990s.
"""

Notes = """
Year is 1919, the actual publication date of this specific issue. Punch as a publication began in 1841, but each issue is a distinct work. The references to the ex-Kaiser "growing a beard," de Valera, and the Peace Conference firmly date this to early 1919. Not marked appropriate-for-children as it contains political satire requiring historical context to appreciate.
