Summary = """
Croisilles is a romantic short story (nouvelle) by Alfred de Musset, one of the major French Romantic writers. The tale follows a young man named Croisilles, son of a goldsmith, who falls in love with a woman above his social station. Set during the reign of Louis XV, it's a charming story about love, class differences, and fortune. The story exemplifies Musset's elegant prose style and his characteristic themes of romantic idealism meeting social reality.
