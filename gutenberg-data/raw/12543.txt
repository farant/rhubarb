This appears to be an issue of "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction," which was a popular British periodical/magazine published in the 19th century. This particular issue is from December 22, 1832 (Volume 20, No. 582).

This is a periodical publication rather than a single-authored book. The Mirror was edited by various people over its run, but it's a collaborative periodical with multiple contributors, and individual articles were often unsigned or anonymous.

For periodicals like this, the "author" would typically be listed as the editor or simply as "Various" since it contains multiple articles by different writers. The year is clearly 1832 based on the publication date.
