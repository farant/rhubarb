Summary = """
'Burnham Breaker' is a novel by Homer Greene set in the coal mining regions of Pennsylvania. Greene was known for writing stories about the lives of coal miners and breaker boys (young workers who separated coal from slate in the breakers). The novel likely follows the adventures and challenges faced by young characters in this industrial setting, exploring themes of work, family, and perseverance in the late 19th century American coal industry. Greene's works were popular in their time for their realistic portrayal of working-class life and were considered appropriate reading for young people.

The year 1887 is clearly indicated in the dedication ("HONESDALE, PENN., SEPT. 29, 1887"). Homer Greene was not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag is not included. The work is appropriate for children as it was written in the tradition of late 19th century youth literature.
