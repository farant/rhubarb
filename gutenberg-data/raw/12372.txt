I can see this is an issue of The Atlantic Monthly magazine from April 1858, containing a personal reminiscence essay about "The Hundred Days" - the period when Napoleon returned from Elba in 1815. This is not a standalone book but rather a magazine article/essay from a periodical publication.

Let me provide the structured information:

Summary = """
This is an issue of The Atlantic Monthly magazine from April 1858. The magazine was founded in 1857 as a literary and cultural commentary magazine in Boston. This particular issue includes a personal reminiscence essay titled "The Hundred Days" which recounts the author's schoolboy experiences in Paris during Napoleon's return from Elba (March 20 - June 28, 1815). The essay provides a firsthand account of daily life in one of Napoleon's National Lyceums, describing the militaristic educational system of the period. The Atlantic Monthly became one of America's most prestigious magazines and continues publication today.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1858 reflects the publication date of this specific magazine issue. The content discusses events from 1815, but this is a retrospective account published 43 years after the events described. As a periodical rather than a standalone work, the appropriate date is the magazine's publication year. The essay appears to be anonymous or the author's name appears elsewhere in the issue not shown in this excerpt.
