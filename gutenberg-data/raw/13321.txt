A collection of essays and reminiscences about early California, particularly San Francisco and the old Spanish missions. Charles Warren Stoddard (1843-1909) was a California writer, poet, and convert to Catholicism who became a professor at the Catholic University of America. The book offers nostalgic glimpses of mission life, the city's development, and the legacy of the Franciscan padres who established the California missions.
