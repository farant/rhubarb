Summary = """
T. S. Eliot's first published poetry collection, containing twelve poems including the famous "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock." The collection established Eliot as a major voice in modernist poetry. The title poem explores themes of alienation, indecision, and the anxiety of modern urban life through the interior monologue of a middle-aged man. The epigraph is from Dante's Inferno (Canto XXVII), spoken by Guido da Montefeltro. The collection is dedicated to Jean Verdenal, a French medical student and friend of Eliot's who died at Gallipoli in 1915.
