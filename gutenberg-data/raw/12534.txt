Summary = """
'Le Péché de Monsieur Antoine' is a novel by George Sand published in 1847. It is one of Sand's socialist novels, exploring themes of class conflict, social justice, and the relationship between different social strata in rural France. The work reflects Sand's political ideals and her interest in the lives of peasants and working people. The novel deals with the tensions between landed gentry and common workers, with characters like the charpentier (carpenter) Jappeloup representing the common people who interact freely with their supposed social superiors. The excerpt provided shows Chapter XXIV of the second volume, featuring M. Galuchet reporting to M. Cardonnet about observations at Châteaubrun, revealing class tensions and social dynamics.

Notes = """
George Sand was the pen name of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin, Baronne Dudevant. While she was raised Catholic and educated in a convent, her adult life was marked by progressive political views and she moved away from orthodox Catholicism, so this work would not qualify for the 'catholic' tag. The novel was originally published in 1847 during Sand's period of writing socially-conscious fiction influenced by socialist ideas. This particular edition appears to be from the collected works ('Œuvres de George Sand').
