Summary = """
The Humorous Lieutenant (also known as Demetrius and Enanthe) is a tragicomedy by John Fletcher, one of the leading playwrights of the Jacobean era. The play tells the story of Demetrius, son of King Antigonus, who is in love with Celia (alias Enanthe), the daughter of Seleucus, one of his father's enemies. The "humorous lieutenant" of the title is a comic character whose courage and abilities fluctuate wildly depending on his health condition, providing comic relief throughout the military and romantic intrigue. The play combines elements of military conflict among the successor kings following Alexander the Great's empire, romantic complications between the younger generation, and bawdy comedy centered on the eccentric lieutenant character. It exemplifies Fletcher's skill at blending serious romantic drama with broad comedy.
