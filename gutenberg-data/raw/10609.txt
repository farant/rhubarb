This is a comprehensive textbook on English literature designed for schools, covering the entire span of English literary history from the Anglo-Saxon period through the Victorian Era. William J. Long (1866-1952) was an American minister, naturalist, and educator who wrote several popular educational works. The book aims to encourage students to read primary literary works rather than just secondary criticism, while also situating literature within its historical and social context. It was widely used in American schools in the early 20th century as a standard introduction to English literary history.
