Summary = """
Lettres de mon moulin (Letters from My Windmill) is a collection of short stories by French author Alphonse Daudet, first published in 1869. The work presents itself as letters written from a windmill in Provence, though Daudet never actually lived in one. The stories are charming, pastoral tales set in the Provençal countryside, blending humor, pathos, and vivid local color. The collection includes well-known stories like "La Chèvre de Monsieur Seguin" (Mr. Seguin's Goat) and "L'Arlésienne." The work is celebrated for its evocative depiction of southern French rural life and its accessible, engaging prose style. It remains a beloved classic of French literature, often studied in schools.
"""

Notes = """
The work was initially published as serialized stories in various periodicals starting in 1866, then collected and published as a book in 1869. I've chosen 1869 as it marks the first complete publication as a unified collection. The mock-notarial deed ("Avant-Propos") that opens the work is Daudet's fictional literary device establishing his claim to the windmill from which the letters are supposedly written.
