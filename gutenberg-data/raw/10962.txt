Summary = """
A collection of natural history essays by Scottish naturalist E.H. Aitken, who lived and worked in India. The book covers various topics including animal anatomy (feet, bills, tails, noses, ears), specific creatures like the barn owl and snakes, Indian snake-charmers and snake-bite remedies, Indian trees (coconut and betel nut), and aspects of Indian culture including festivals and poverty. Written with both scientific observation and accessible humor, Aitken's work reflects the Victorian/Edwardian tradition of popular natural history writing. The book includes a memoir by Surgeon-General W.B. Bannerman and illustrations by J.A. Shepherd."""

Notes = """
The publication year of 1914 is clearly stated on the title page. E.H. Aitken (1851-1909) was known for his engaging natural history writing about India, where he worked for the Bombay Civil Service. This appears to be a posthumous publication, as indicated by the inclusion of a memoir about the author. His pen name "EHA" stood for "Eha" which was his way of signing his works."""
