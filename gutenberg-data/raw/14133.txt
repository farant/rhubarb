Summary = """
David Balfour (also known as "Catriona" in the UK) is the sequel to Stevenson's beloved adventure novel "Kidnapped" (1886). The story continues following young David Balfour after his kidnapping ordeal, now dealing with the aftermath of the Appin Murder (the real historical assassination of Colin Roy Campbell in 1752). The novel follows David's attempts to testify on behalf of the wrongly accused James Stewart, his imprisonment on the Bass Rock, travels to Holland and France, and his romantic entanglement with Catriona Drummond, daughter of the notorious outlaw's son James More MacGregor. It combines historical fiction with adventure and romance, set against the backdrop of post-Jacobite Scotland.
