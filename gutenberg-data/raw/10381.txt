This is Victor Hugo's eyewitness account of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's coup d'état of December 2, 1851, which dissolved the French National Assembly and established the dictatorship that would become the Second Empire. Hugo, then a member of the Assembly, participated in the resistance and was forced into exile. The work documents the events day by day, including the arrests of representatives, the street fighting, and the suppression of republican opposition. Hugo wrote it shortly after the events but delayed publication until after the fall of the Second Empire.
