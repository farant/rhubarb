Summary = """
A novel by Ellen Glasgow, a prominent American novelist known for her realistic portrayals of the American South. The title is taken from Shakespeare's "As You Like It" ("All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts"). The novel is set in Virginia during the post-World War I era and explores political and social themes through the story of Gideon Vetch, a populist governor of humble origins, and his interactions with the old Virginia aristocracy. It examines class tensions, political idealism, and the changing social landscape of the South.

Notes = """
Ellen Glasgow (1873-1945) was a Virginia-born novelist who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1942. While she was raised in a Presbyterian household and her works often engage with moral and social questions, she would not be considered a Catholic author and her works would not carry a nihil obstat.
