I recognize this work from the elaborate title and the distinctive approach to grammar pedagogy. Let me provide the structured information:

Summary = """
'The Grammar of English Grammars' is a comprehensive and prescriptive English grammar text by Goold Brown, first published in 1851. This massive work (often running to over 1,000 pages in its complete editions) represents one of the most exhaustive treatments of English grammar in the 19th century. Brown took an extremely prescriptive approach, critiquing other grammarians of his era and establishing rigid standards for correctness in English usage. The work includes extensive exercises, parsing examples, and analysis of disputed grammatical points. It was widely used in American schools during the mid-19th century and exemplifies the highly formal, rule-based approach to grammar instruction characteristic of that period. The transcriber's note about Brown's severity toward those who "depart from his standard of correctness" while the source text itself contains typographical errors is somewhat ironic and indicative of Brown's uncompromising pedagogical stance.
