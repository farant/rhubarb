Summary = """
McClure's Magazine was one of the most influential American periodicals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This January 1896 issue contains a notable installment of Ida M. Tarbell's serialized biography of Abraham Lincoln, covering his early experiences in Illinois including his time at Denton Offutt's store, encounters with the Clary's Grove boys, his grammar studies, and participation in the Black Hawk War. The issue also features Cleveland Moffett's tribute to Eugene Field alongside a collection of Field's beloved children's poems including 'The Duel' and 'Seein' Things.' Additional content includes Murat Halstead on the defeat of James G. Blaine, Will H. Low on painting, Sir Robert Ball on solar physics, and fiction by Anthony Hope and Herbert D. Ward.
"""

Notes = """
McClure's Magazine was founded by S.S. McClure in 1893 and became famous for its muckraking journalism. Ida Tarbell's Lincoln biography, serialized in the magazine beginning in 1895, was extensively researched and helped establish her reputation before her later exposé of Standard Oil. Eugene Field had died in November 1895, making the tribute and poem collection in this issue particularly timely.
