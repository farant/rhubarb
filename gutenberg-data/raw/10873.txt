Summary = """
"At Sunwich Port" is a comic novel by W. W. Jacobs, set in a small English seaport town. The story involves romantic entanglements, family conflicts, and social class differences typical of Jacobs's work. The novel features the Nugent family and various colorful local characters including the Kybirds. Jacobs was a master of dialogue and situation comedy, and this work showcases his talent for depicting working-class English life with humor and sympathy. While he's most famous for his horror story "The Monkey's Paw," Jacobs primarily wrote lighthearted tales of seafaring life and small-town England.
