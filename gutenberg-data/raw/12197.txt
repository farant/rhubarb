'Mr. Scraggs' is a collection of humorous short stories by Henry Wallace Phillips, featuring the character Red Saunders as narrator/introducer. Phillips was an American author known for his Western humor and stories about frontier life. The book contains seven stories with titles like 'By Proxy,' 'In the Toils,' and 'The Fountain of Youth.' Phillips's writing style was characterized by gentle humor and colorful Western characters.

Notes = """
The year 1906 represents the first book publication date (January 1906, with a second edition in February 1906). The copyright page indicates the stories were previously published in magazines between 1903-1905 (The Curtis Publishing Co. and S.S. McClure Co.). I chose 1906 as it represents when this collection was formally published as a complete work. This is appropriate family-friendly Western humor from the early 1900s American literary tradition.
