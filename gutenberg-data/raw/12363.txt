Summary = """
The Botanist's Companion is a comprehensive manual of practical botany by William Salisbury, of the Botanic Garden of Sloane-Street in London. This work focuses on plants growing wild in Great Britain or cultivated for agriculture, medicine, rural economy, or the arts. Unlike other botanical manuals of the period, Salisbury's work emphasizes the practical uses and applications of plants rather than purely taxonomic classification. The author conducted experiments for the Board of Agriculture over 25 years, particularly on grasses, and intended this as both a field guide and a reference work for his botanic garden. Volume II includes detailed descriptions of medicinal plants and their applications. The work represents early 19th-century British botanical science with a practical, utilitarian focus.
