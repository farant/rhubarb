Summary = """

"""

Notes = """
The text clearly indicates 1914 as the publication year. Eino Leino was not a Catholic author - he was Finnish and worked primarily within the context of Finnish national romanticism and modernism. The work is fiction but not appropriate to tag as 'appropriate-for-children' given it deals with adult themes of business and banking.
