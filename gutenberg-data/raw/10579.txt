The year 1916 is stated directly in the text. Vance Barnum was likely a house pseudonym used by the Stratemeyer Syndicate or a similar publisher of juvenile series books. These books were designed to appeal to young readers, particularly boys, in the early 20th century with adventure stories featuring wholesome protagonists.
