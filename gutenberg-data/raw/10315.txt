Summary = """
This is a revised anthology of major works of Persian literature published in 1909, with an introduction by scholar Richard J. H. Gottheil. The volume compiles four foundational works of Persian literary tradition: the Sháh Námeh (Book of Kings) by Firdusi, an epic of Persian kings and heroes; the Rubáiyát by Omar Khayyám, philosophical quatrains; the Divan by Háfiz, mystical poetry; and the Gulistan (Rose Garden) by Sa'di, a collection of stories and moral tales. Gottheil's introduction emphasizes the romantic and enduring appeal of Persian literature to Western audiences, noting how Persian poets have earned a place alongside canonical Western writers.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1909 reflects the publication date of this specific anthology/compilation rather than the original works, which span from the 10th-14th centuries CE. This appears to be part of a larger series presenting Persian literature to English-speaking audiences during the early 20th century wave of Orientalist scholarship and translation.
