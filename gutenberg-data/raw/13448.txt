Summary = """
A collection of essays by the Irish-born essayist and literary critic Robert Lynd (1879-1949). Lynd was known for his witty, reflective essays on everyday subjects, often published in periodicals like The New Statesman under the pen name "Y.Y." This collection covers a characteristically eclectic range of topics including natural history (insects, cats, herring), gambling, virtue, and the title essay which playfully celebrates the joys of not knowing everything. Lynd was a popular essayist in the tradition of Charles Lamb, known for his gentle humor and accessible style.
