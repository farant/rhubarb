I need to analyze this Project Gutenberg text to identify the title, author, year, and other metadata.

Based on the text, this is clearly a French work titled "Contes des Fées" (Fairy Tales) by Robert de Bonnières. Let me recall what I know about this author and work.

Robert de Bonnières (1850-1905) was a French writer and journalist. He wrote "Contes des Fées" which was published in the late 19th century. Based on my knowledge, this collection of fairy tales in verse was published around 1880-1881.

This is a literary work of fairy tales written in verse form, containing stories like "Le Rosier Enchanté" (The Enchanted Rosebush). The style is whimsical and poetic, meant for a general audience but appropriate for children given the fairy tale content.
