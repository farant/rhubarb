A children's story published in the mid-19th century by John R. Bolles. Based on the title and publication context (Daniel Burgess & Co. was a publisher of children's literature), this appears to be a moral or instructive tale featuring two bulls, likely designed to convey lessons about character, behavior, or virtue to young readers in the tradition of 19th-century children's literature.
