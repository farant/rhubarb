Summary = """
This is a collection of poems by American poet Vachel Lindsay (1879-1931), featuring his most famous work "The Congo" along with other poems. Lindsay was known for his innovative approach to poetry, incorporating performance elements and what he called "the higher vaudeville" - poems meant to be read aloud with rhythmic, almost musical qualities. The collection includes twenty-two "moon poems" and features stage directions for oral performance. Lindsay was discovered by Harriet Monroe's influential magazine "Poetry" in 1912-1913, when his poem "General William Booth Enters into Heaven" was published. He was part of the early 20th century American poetry renaissance and brought a unique, performative style to his work that emphasized sound and rhythm. Lindsay was associated with the Midwest and Illinois specifically, and his work often celebrated American themes and figures.
