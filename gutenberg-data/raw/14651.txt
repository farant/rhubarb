Summary = """
"Kauppaneuvoksen härkä" (The Commercial Counselor's Ox/Bull) is a four-act comedy by Finnish author Teuvo Pakkala (1862-1925). Pakkala was a significant figure in Finnish literature, known for his realistic portrayals of everyday Finnish life, particularly in the Oulu region. He wrote novels, short stories, and plays. This comedy features a cast of small-town characters including a mayor, his wife and daughters, a commercial counselor, a newspaper editor, a cantor, and various townspeople. The play satirizes provincial bourgeois society and its pretensions.
"""

Notes = """
The Gutenberg text shows publication by Otava in 1922, but the play was originally written and first performed in 1901. I chose 1901 as it represents the original creation of the work rather than this particular edition. Pakkala was a Lutheran Finnish author, not Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply.
