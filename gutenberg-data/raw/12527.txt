Summary = """
"Kimono" is a novel by John Paris (pseudonym of Frank Ashton-Gwatkin, a British diplomat) published in 1922. The novel explores the complexities of an Anglo-Japanese marriage and the cultural tensions between East and West during the early 20th century. Through its chapters, the work examines themes of cross-cultural relationships, the lives of geisha and women in the Yoshiwara district, and the challenges faced by mixed-race individuals (referenced in the chapter on "Eurasia" and "The Half-Caste Girl"). The novel provides a window into Japanese society as seen through Western eyes during the Taisho period, touching on traditional Japanese culture including family altars, dwarf trees, and geisha entertainment, while also addressing the difficult realities of cultural integration and identity.
