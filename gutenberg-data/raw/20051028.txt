Summary = """
A Gothic short story in which Prince Prospero attempts to escape a deadly plague called the Red Death by sealing himself and a thousand nobles inside a fortified abbey. During an elaborate masquerade ball held in seven colored rooms, a mysterious figure dressed as a victim of the Red Death appears and proves that no wealth or walls can protect against death. The story is a powerful allegory about the inevitability of mortality and the futility of trying to escape it through isolation and revelry.
"""

Notes = """
First published in Graham's Magazine in May 1842. The story was written during a period when cholera and tuberculosis epidemics were common concerns, which likely influenced Poe's imagery of the plague.
