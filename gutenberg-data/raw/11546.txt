Summary = """
William James Stillman (1828-1901) was an American journalist, diplomat, and painter associated with the Pre-Raphaelite movement. He founded The Crayon, an influential American art journal, in 1855. He served as U.S. Consul in Rome and later in Crete, where he became deeply involved in the Cretan uprising against Ottoman rule. As a correspondent for The Times of London, he covered major events in the Balkans and Mediterranean. This autobiography, published in two volumes in 1901 (the year of his death), recounts his varied career spanning art criticism, diplomacy, and journalism, including his friendships with figures like Ruskin, Lowell, and the Pre-Raphaelites.
"""

Notes = """
1901 is the publication year of this autobiography. Stillman died in 1901, so this represents his final work. The book was published by Houghton, Mifflin & Co. as mentioned in the preface.
