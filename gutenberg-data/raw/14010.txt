Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly magazine published from 1822 to 1849. It was one of the first inexpensive literary periodicals aimed at the growing middle-class readership, predating Penny Magazine and similar publications. Each issue contained a mix of articles on travel, natural history, biography, poetry, and general interest topics, often accompanied by wood engravings. This particular issue (No. 574, November 3, 1832) features an article on Lydford Bridge in Devon, England, near Dartmoor, describing the picturesque scenery and the village's historical significance as noted in the Domesday Book.
"""

Notes = """
Year 1832 is taken directly from the publication date printed in the issue header. This is a periodical rather than a monograph, so the publication date is the historically accurate date. The magazine was founded by John Limbird in London. Price of 2d (two pence) reflects its positioning as affordable literature for the masses.
