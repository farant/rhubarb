Notes = """
The year 1911 is clearly stated on the title page as the publication year. This appears to be the original publication date for this work. Parrish was an active writer in the early 20th century, and many of his Civil War novels were published during this period, capitalizing on the still-recent memory of the conflict and the popularity of historical romance fiction.
