I'll read through this text to identify the work, author, and relevant details.

This is clearly "Bull Hunter" by Max Brand (Frederick Faust's pen name). Max Brand was an incredibly prolific author who wrote westerns and adventure fiction in the early 20th century. "Bull Hunter" was published in 1921 and is one of his well-known western novels.

The text shows the opening of the novel with the Campbell brothers trying to remove a tree stump. Max Brand was not a Catholic author, and his westerns were adventure/genre fiction aimed at popular audiences. While generally clean adventure stories, they're western fiction with typical themes of violence and frontier justice.
