Summary = """
This is an article from the March 1858 issue of The Atlantic Monthly, one of America's most prestigious literary magazines founded in 1857. The article "The Catacombs of Rome" discusses the underground burial sites of early Christians in Rome. The piece takes a scholarly Protestant perspective, critiquing how the Roman Catholic Church has historically used the catacombs to support its claims while also acknowledging the genuine historical and spiritual significance of these sites. The author references recent archaeological investigations that were bringing new scholarly rigor to the study of early Christian history in Rome. The opening epigraph is from Dante's Paradiso, Canto IX.
