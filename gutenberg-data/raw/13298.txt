This is an anthology of prose and poetry selections from living California authors at the turn of the 20th century, compiled and edited by George Wharton James.

It celebrates California's landscapes, climate, flora, fauna, and cultural achievements through the words of contemporary California writers, with brief biographical sketches of each contributor.
