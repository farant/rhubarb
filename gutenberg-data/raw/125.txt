Notes = """
First published in 1909. This was Stratton-Porter's second novel featuring the Limberlost Swamp setting, following "Freckles" (1904). The characters Terence O'More and Mrs. O'More mentioned in the character list are references to characters from Freckles. The novel was immensely popular in its time and helped raise awareness about the Indiana wetlands before they were largely drained for agriculture.
