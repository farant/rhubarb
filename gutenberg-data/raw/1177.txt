Summary = """
The Memorabilia is one of the primary sources for understanding the historical Socrates, written by his student Xenophon. It consists of four books that record conversations and actions of Socrates, aiming to defend him against the charges that led to his execution and to portray him as a model of virtue and wisdom. Unlike Plato's more philosophical dialogues, Xenophon's account focuses on Socrates as a practical moral teacher concerned with everyday ethics and civic virtue. The work provides valuable insight into Socratic teaching methods and 4th century BCE Athenian society.
"""

Notes = """
Dating ancient works is complex. Xenophon lived 431-354 BCE. The Memorabilia was likely composed sometime between 385-375 BCE, after Socrates' death in 399 BCE and during Xenophon's exile. I've chosen approximately -371 BCE as a middle estimate for the composition date, representing when the work itself was written rather than the events it describes. The negative year notation follows historical convention (BCE). This translation by H.G. Dakyns was published by Macmillan in 1897.

</result>

The work is by Xenophon, one of Socrates' students, written several decades after Socrates' death in 399 BCE. It's a defense and character portrait of Socrates, focusing on his practical wisdom and moral teaching. Not appropriate for young children due to the philosophical complexity, and not a Catholic work (predates Christianity by several centuries, though it has been studied within Catholic educational traditions as part of classical philosophy).
