Summary = """
Punch, or The London Charivari was a British weekly magazine of humor and satire established in 1841. It became one of the most influential and long-running humor magazines in the world, known for its witty social commentary, political cartoons, and comedic sketches of Victorian and Edwardian life. This particular volume (99) from December 20, 1890 includes "Voces Populi" (Voices of the People), a recurring feature that satirized everyday social situations through dialogue and scenes. The excerpt shows a humorous sketch set in a riding-school, poking gentle fun at middle-class Londoners taking riding lessons. Punch was essential reading for the British middle and upper classes and helped define Victorian humor.
"""

Notes = """
Punch was published weekly from 1841 to 1992, then from 1996 to 2002. The year 1890 is straightforward here as this is a periodical issue rather than a standalone literary work. "Various" is appropriate for the author field as Punch featured contributions from multiple writers and cartoonists, though individual pieces were often unsigned or used pseudonyms. This is clearly not a Catholic work despite being generally family-appropriate Victorian humor.
