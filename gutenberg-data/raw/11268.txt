Notes = """
Year chosen is 1851, the copyright date shown in the text. This is a 19th-century American Catholic publication by Hogan, Perkins & Co. of Philadelphia. While the biblical story of Noah dates to ancient times, this particular work is a Victorian-era children's educational text, so the relevant historical date is when this specific edition was produced and published. The series title "The Good Child's Library" was typical of Catholic educational publishing of this period.
