**"L'Enfer" (The Inferno)** by **Henri Barbusse**, originally published in French in **1908**. This is not Dante's Inferno, but rather a controversial modernist novel by the French author Henri Barbusse, who later became famous for his WWI novel "Under Fire" (Le Feu, 1916).

The text shows this is from the 1918 English translation by Edward J. O'Brien, translated from the 100th French edition. The novel is a philosophical work that caused quite a scandal when it was published due to its voyeuristic premise and frank treatment of human nature.

Summary = """
L'Enfer (The Inferno) is a controversial modernist novel by Henri Barbusse, originally published in French in 1908. The novel tells the story of a solitary man who discovers a hole in the wall of his hotel room, through which he observes the lives of various occupants in the adjoining room. Through this voyeuristic lens, the protagonist witnesses the full spectrum of human experience - love, death, betrayal, joy, and suffering. The novel is deeply philosophical, exploring themes of isolation, the nature of human existence, and the limitations of observation and understanding. It caused considerable scandal upon publication due to its frank treatment of sexuality and human nature. Barbusse later became famous for his WWI novel "Under Fire" (1916), which won the Prix Goncourt.
