Summary = """
A scholarly letter written by Joseph Planta, F.R.S., to Sir John Pringle, President of the Royal Society, describing the Romansh language spoken in the mountainous regions of the Grisons (Graubünden), Switzerland. The work provides a detailed philological account of this Romance language, including its two main dialects (Ladin and Cialover), their geographic distribution, and characteristics. The letter was occasioned by Count de Salis presenting a Bible translation in Romansh to the Royal Society. This is an important early systematic description of the Romansh language for an English-speaking scholarly audience.
