Summary = """
Doctor Marigold is a Christmas story by Charles Dickens, originally published as the Christmas number of his magazine "All the Year Round" in 1865. The story is narrated by a "Cheap Jack" (a travelling salesman who sells goods from a cart at fairs and markets) named Doctor Marigold. The tale follows his life, including the tragic loss of his daughter and his later adoption of a deaf-mute girl named Sophy. It's a sentimental story exploring themes of loss, love, and redemption, typical of Dickens' Christmas stories. The narrative voice captures the distinctive patter and showmanship of the travelling salesmen of Victorian England.
