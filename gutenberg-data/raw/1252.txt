Summary = """
Le Morte d'Arthur is the most comprehensive and influential collection of Arthurian legends in English literature. Written by Sir Thomas Malory during his imprisonment in the 1460s-1470s, it synthesizes French and English sources into a unified narrative of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, the quest for the Holy Grail, and the fall of Camelot. The work combines chivalric romance with Christian themes, exploring ideals of knighthood, loyalty, courtly love, and spiritual questing. It served as the primary source for most subsequent retellings of Arthurian legend in English.
"""

Notes = """
I chose 1485 as the year because that's when William Caxton published the work, which is the traditional date associated with Le Morte d'Arthur. Malory likely completed the manuscript around 1469-1470, but it wasn't available to the public until Caxton's printing. The 1485 date is the most historically significant and commonly referenced. The work is tagged as 'catholic' because Malory was writing in pre-Reformation England, and the text is deeply infused with medieval Catholic spirituality, particularly in the Grail quest narrative.

The text you're looking at is Volume II of a two-volume edition. This is one of the foundational texts of English literature—Malory wrote it while imprisoned, drawing together various French and English Arthurian romances into what became THE definitive English version of the Arthur story. The medieval Catholic worldview permeates the entire work, especially visible in the Grail quest sections.
