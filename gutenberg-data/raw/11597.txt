Summary = """
A collection of short stories by French naturalist writer Guy de Maupassant. The title story 'Mademoiselle Fifi' is set during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and depicts Prussian officers occupying a French château. The story is known for its vivid portrayal of the brutality and arrogance of the occupying forces, and features themes of resistance, patriotism, and moral courage. Maupassant was a master of the short story form, known for his realistic depictions of French society and human nature. This collection includes 18 stories dealing with various aspects of French life, relationships, and the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War.
"""

Notes = """
'Mademoiselle Fifi' was first published in 1882 as a collection. The title story itself was originally published in the Gil Blas newspaper in 1882. Maupassant served in the Franco-Prussian War, which deeply influenced his writing. While Maupassant was culturally Catholic (raised in Normandy in a Catholic society), his works are naturalistic and often cynical in outlook, so this would not qualify for the 'catholic' tag as it would not likely receive nihil obstat/imprimatur.
