This appears to be a collection of poems by Thomas Gent, a minor English poet from the early 19th century. Based on the publication information (London, 1828) and the advertisement dated December 1827, this is clearly the 1828 edition of his collected poems.

Summary = """
This is a collection of poems by Thomas Gent, a relatively obscure English poet 
of the early 19th century. The volume includes both previously published pieces 
that had been well-received individually, as well as many poems being printed 
for the first time. Gent describes himself as someone whose financial circumstances 
prevented him from devoting himself fully to poetry, making it merely 'the amusements 
of the leisure hours' rather than a full-time pursuit. The Advertisement reveals 
a touching personal note - during the printing of this collection, Gent suffered 
a severe domestic loss (likely the death of his wife), which he mentions with 
considerable emotion at the end of his preface.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1828 is clearly indicated as the publication date in London. This is an 
original work from that period, not a translation or reprint of earlier material. 
Thomas Gent was not a major literary figure, and little is known about him today. 
The work is not Catholic in nature - it appears to be secular English poetry from 
the Romantic era. The tag 'not-appropriate-for-children' is applied as a default 
for general poetry collections of this period, though the actual content may vary.
