Notes = """
James Richardson (1806-1851) was a British explorer who made multiple journeys to North Africa. He died in Unguratua (in present-day Nigeria) during a British government-sponsored expedition to Central Africa. This work on Morocco was published posthumously in 1860, edited by his widow. The introduction's reference to Sir William Codrington as Governor of Gibraltar and ongoing Franco-Spanish tensions with Morocco helps date the publication to around 1859-1860, during the Spanish-Moroccan War (1859-1860).
