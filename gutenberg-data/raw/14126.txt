Summary = """
"The Marriage of William Ashe" is a novel by Mary Augusta Ward (known professionally as Mrs. Humphry Ward), one of the most popular English novelists of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. The story is loosely based on the real-life marriage of Lady Caroline Lamb and William Lamb (later Lord Melbourne, Queen Victoria's first Prime Minister). The novel follows the marriage of ambitious politician William Ashe to the brilliant but volatile Lady Kitty Bristol, exploring themes of political ambition, marital discord, and the constraints placed on women in English society. Mrs. Humphry Ward was known for her social novels that examined moral and religious questions of the day.
