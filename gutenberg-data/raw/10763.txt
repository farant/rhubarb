"""

Notes = """
Based on the Project Gutenberg ebook number (10763) and the foreword's emphasis on "very recent poems" and "living poets," this anthology was most likely published in the early 1920s. The year 1921 is consistent with the style and approach described. This type of motivational poetry anthology was particularly popular in the post-World War I era.
