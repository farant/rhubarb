Summary = """
A collection of seven romantic short stories by William Dean Howells, one of America's leading realist writers and editor of The Atlantic Monthly. The collection includes 'Editha,' one of Howells' most famous anti-war stories about a young woman who romanticizes war and pushes her fiancé to enlist, with tragic consequences. The other stories explore themes of memory, identity, love, and psychological phenomena through Howells' characteristic realist lens and gentle irony. The title comes from Longfellow and suggests the liminal, uncertain spaces where these romantic and psychological dramas unfold.
"""

Notes = """
Published in 1907, the same year as the book's copyright. Howells was not a Catholic author - he was raised in a Swedenborgian household and later became agnostic with socialist sympathies. While his work is morally serious and psychologically astute, it would not receive a nihil obstat or imprimatur. The stories deal with romantic and psychological themes in a manner typical of American literary realism of the period.
