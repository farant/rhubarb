Summary = """
A romantic novel by British author Beatrice Harraden, first published in 1893. The story is set in a tuberculosis sanatorium in the Swiss Alps (Petershof) and centers on the relationship between Bernardine Holme, a young woman suffering from consumption, and Robert Allitsen, a cynical, disagreeable man who is also a patient. The novel explores themes of illness, mortality, sacrifice, and the brief but meaningful connections people make in life. The title references Longfellow's poem and the metaphor of ships that briefly encounter each other before continuing on their separate journeys. The book was enormously popular in its time and helped establish Harraden's literary reputation.
