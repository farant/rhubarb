Summary = """
A comedic novel originally serialized in Punch magazine (1888-1889) and published as a book in 1892. It follows Charles Pooter, a middle-class clerk living in suburban London, who chronicles his daily life with earnest self-importance while being completely unaware of his own absurdity. The humor arises from Pooter's pomposity, social mishaps, and the mundane concerns he treats with great seriousness. It is considered a classic of English comic literature and a satire of Victorian suburban life and middle-class pretensions.
"""

Notes = """
First serialized in Punch 1888-1889, first published as a complete book in 1892. The 1892 date is most appropriate as it represents the complete work with Weedon Grossmith's illustrations.
