Summary = """
This is Conrad Hjalmar Nordby's scholarly study examining how Old Norse literature (the sagas, Eddas, and other medieval Scandinavian texts) influenced English literature over the centuries. The work traces the transmission of Norse themes, stories, and stylistic elements into English literary tradition. The epigraph from the Hávamál (a poem from the Poetic Edda) about the endurance of fame sets the thematic tone. Nordby was a Norwegian-born scholar, and this was published posthumously as his only literary work, edited by friends after his death.
