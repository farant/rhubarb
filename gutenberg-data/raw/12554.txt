Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a pioneering British weekly magazine published from 1822 to 1849 by John Limbird. It was one of the earliest cheap periodicals aimed at a mass readership, predating Penny Magazine by about a decade. Each issue contained a mix of essays, biographical sketches, historical narratives, fiction, poetry, scientific discoveries, and domestic advice. Volume XIX covers the year 1832, a significant year in British history marked by the passage of the Reform Act. The magazine was notable for its accessibility and broad appeal, bringing literature and useful knowledge to the working and middle classes at an affordable price.
"""

Notes = """
1832 is the publication year printed on the title page. The magazine was a serial publication, so this volume represents a compilation of weekly issues from that year. The frontispiece portrait of Earl Grey likely refers to Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, who was Prime Minister at the time and championed the Reform Act of 1832.
