Summary = """
This is the second volume of Charles de Rémusat's comprehensive study of Peter Abelard (1079-1142), the famous medieval French philosopher, theologian, and logician. Rémusat, a 19th-century French politician, philosopher, and member of the Académie française, undertook this scholarly work to rehabilitate Abelard's reputation and establish his importance in the history of philosophy. This particular volume focuses on Abelard's philosophy, including his metaphysics and his famous position in the debate over universals (the question of whether abstract concepts like "species" and "genera" have real existence or are merely names). The work draws extensively on primary sources including Jean de Salisbury, one of Abelard's students.
