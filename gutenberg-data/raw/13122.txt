Summary = """
This is a French-language historical account of three heroes of the Montreal colony in New France: Jacques Le Maître and Guillaume Vignal, both priests of Saint-Sulpice, covering the period 1659-1661. The work describes their arrival in Canada aboard a ship afflicted with plague, their ministry alongside the Hospitaller sisters and Marguerite Bourgeoys (founder of the Congregation of Notre-Dame), and their service to the sick during the perilous Atlantic crossing. The text is a hagiographic tribute to these early Catholic missionaries who helped establish the religious and social foundations of Montreal.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1887 appears on the title page as the publication date. This is a work of Catholic historiography about 17th-century New France, written from a devotional perspective celebrating the Sulpician missionaries and religious sisters who founded Montreal's institutions.
