Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British periodical published in the early 19th century. This issue from May 21, 1831 features an article about an old house in Southwark that was demolished to make way for approaches to the New London Bridge. The periodical was known for documenting and preserving records of antiquarian interest, architectural landmarks, and historical curiosities that were disappearing due to modernization. This particular issue focuses on a building believed to have been the residence of Anne Boleyn, featuring architectural details from the reign of Henry VII, along with discussion of Southwark's historical significance as a London suburb.
