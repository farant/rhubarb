I need to analyze this text from Project Gutenberg to identify the title, author, year, and other information.

This appears to be an issue of "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction" - a 19th century British periodical. The specific issue is Vol. 10, No. 273, dated Saturday, September 15, 1827.

This is a periodical/magazine, not a single-author work. The text shows a letter to the editor about Gaspard Monge's mausoleum. The Mirror of Literature was a popular weekly publication that featured miscellaneous articles, engravings, and correspondence.

Let me provide the structured information:
