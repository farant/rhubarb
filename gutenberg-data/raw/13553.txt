"""

Notes = """
The year 1919 appears directly on the title page. Dell was a prolific author whose works were bestsellers in Britain and America during the 1910s-1930s. While popular entertainment of her era, her romance novels are not considered appropriate for children due to mature romantic themes, nor do they have particular Catholic significance despite Dell being from a middle-class English background.
