Notes = """
The year 1906 is clearly indicated on the title page as the publication date. Myrtle Reed (1874-1911) was an American author whose works were bestsellers in her time. While Reed was not a Catholic author and this appears to be secular romantic fiction, it was appropriate for the general reading public of the early 1900s and would be considered suitable for older children and young adults.
