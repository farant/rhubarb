Summary = """
This is the tenth volume in John R. Musick's "The Real America in Romance" series, a multi-volume work of historical fiction designed to make American history more accessible and engaging for general readers. The series attempts to fill in the human details and lived experiences that formal histories often omit. "Sustained Honor" focuses on the Age of Liberty in America, presenting historical events through romanticized narrative rather than dry scholastic writing.

Notes = """
The 1909 date is clearly marked on the title page and represents the publication year of this volume. This is part of a larger series that covered various periods of American history through historical romance. The work is not Catholic in nature, but rather a general Protestant American historical narrative typical of the era.
