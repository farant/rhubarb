Summary = """
"Radio Boys in the Thousand Islands" is part of the popular "Radio Boys" series of adventure novels published in the early 1920s. These books capitalized on the excitement surrounding the new technology of radio communication, which was revolutionizing society at the time. The series follows young protagonists who use radio equipment to solve mysteries and have adventures. This particular installment is set in the Thousand Islands region along the U.S.-Canadian border in the St. Lawrence River, where the boys follow a "wireless trail" involving radio technology. The Radio Boys series was aimed at young male readers and combined technical information about radio with adventure storytelling, typical of the juvenile adventure fiction popular in the interwar period.
