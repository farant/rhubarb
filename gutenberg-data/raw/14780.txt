Summary = """
William Paley's 'Evidences of Christianity' is one of the most influential works of Christian apologetics from the 18th century. Paley, an Anglican clergyman and philosopher, presents a systematic argument for the truth of Christianity based on historical evidence, particularly focusing on the credibility of the New Testament accounts and the testimony of the apostles. The work examines miracles, the character of the witnesses, the rapid spread of Christianity, and the internal consistency of the Gospels. For over a century, this text was required reading at Cambridge University and significantly shaped Protestant apologetics.
"""

Notes = """
First published in 1794. The edition shown here is an 1851 London printing. Paley was an Anglican, not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag is not applied. The work would likely not receive a nihil obstat as it represents Protestant theological perspectives, though it contains much that is compatible with Catholic teaching on the historical evidence for Christianity.
