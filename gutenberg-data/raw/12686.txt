Notes = """
The copyright page shows various dates from 1906-1913, indicating these stories were published in different magazines (Curtis Publishing Company, Good Housekeeping, etc.) before being collected in this volume. The book publication date is August 1913, which I've used as the primary year since this represents when the collection was assembled and published as a complete work. Owen Johnson was not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag is not included.
