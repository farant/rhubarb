Notes = """
The 1909 date represents the original publication of this specific collection by Constable & Co. Ltd. Alice Meynell was a convert to Catholicism and a respected voice in Catholic literary circles, corresponding with figures like Francis Thompson and Coventry Patmore. Her work would likely have been considered appropriate for the imprimatur, though this was an era when such requirements were less universally enforced for literary essays. Not appropriate-for-children due to the sophisticated literary nature of the content.
