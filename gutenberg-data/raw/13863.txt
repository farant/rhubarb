Summary = """
This is a short philosophical essay by the French Enlightenment philosopher Denis Diderot. In it, he humorously laments the replacement of his old, comfortable dressing gown with a new, luxurious one. The new robe, rather than bringing him joy, has made him a slave to appearances and forced him to upgrade all his other belongings to match its elegance. The essay is a witty meditation on the tyranny of luxury, the corruption of simple pleasures by material acquisitiveness, and what would later be called "the Diderot Effect" - the phenomenon where acquiring a new possession leads to a spiral of consumption to match it.
"""
