Summary = """
'The Three Sisters' is a modernist psychological novel by May Sinclair set in the isolated Yorkshire village of Garth in Garthdale. The novel explores the interior lives and psychological struggles of three sisters living in a vicarage in this bleak, remote setting. Sinclair was an important early 20th-century British writer who pioneered stream-of-consciousness techniques and psychological realism in her fiction. The novel examines themes of isolation, repression, desire, and the limited options available to unmarried women in early 20th-century rural England. The atmospheric opening establishes the oppressive, desolate landscape that mirrors the psychological constraints faced by the characters.
