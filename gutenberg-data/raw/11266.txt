Summary = """
A collection of thirteen sonnets by the Nawab Nizamat Jung Bahadur, an Indian nobleman and poet who wrote in English during the early 20th century. The sonnets explore themes of love, beauty, spirituality, and transcendence, influenced by Platonic philosophy as evidenced by the epigraphs from Empedocles and Plato. The work includes a foreword by R.C. Fraser and a note on the history of the sonnet in English literature. The titles suggest a progression through spiritual and romantic themes, from "Rebirth" through "Constancy," combining Western poetic forms with philosophical contemplation.
"""
