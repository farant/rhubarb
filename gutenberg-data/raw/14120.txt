<result>
Title = "Answer to Dr. Priestley's Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever, Part I"
Author = "Matthew Turner, William Hammon"
Year = 1782

Tags = ["non-fiction", "philosophy", "freethought"]

Summary = """
This work is a response to Joseph Priestley's "Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever" (1780), in which Priestley attempted to prove the existence of God through natural philosophy and reason. Turner and Hammon's reply is historically significant as one of the first openly atheistic works published in England. The text argues against natural theology - the position that God's existence can be proven through reason and observation of nature - while carefully distinguishing this from revealed religion. The authors take a skeptical philosophical position, questioning whether there is sufficient rational or moral proof of a deity's existence and attributes.
"""

Notes = """
The date 1782 comes directly from the title page (MDCCLXXXII). Matthew Turner (d. 1788?) was a Liverpool physician, and William Hammon's identity is less certain. This work is notable in the history of ideas as an early explicit statement of atheism in English print. The Freethought Archives transcription notes that orthography and punctuation irregularities were preserved from the first edition.
