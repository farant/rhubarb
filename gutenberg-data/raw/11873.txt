A travelogue documenting Major T. R. Swinburne's journey through Kashmir, India, particularly the Kashmir Valley (often called "the Happy Valley"). The work combines written descriptions with 24 colored illustrations, chronicling his travels from Karachi through various regions including Abbotabad, Srinagar, the Lolab Valley, the Lidar Valley, and Gangabal. As a travel narrative from the British Raj period, it offers both artistic and written perspectives on the landscape, culture, and experiences of visiting Kashmir in the early 20th century. The epigraph from Arthur Hugh Clough sets a romantic, adventurous tone for the journey.
