Notes = """
1919 is the original publication year for this work. J.S. Fletcher (Joseph Smith Fletcher, 1863-1935) was not a Catholic author - he was a British Methodist - so the 'catholic' tag is not included. The work is adult mystery fiction and not appropriate for children due to the murder mystery content and mature themes.
