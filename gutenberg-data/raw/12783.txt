Summary = """
'Les Mémoires d'un Âne' (Memoirs of a Donkey) is a children's novel by the Comtesse de Ségur, written as an autobiography narrated by a donkey named Cadichon. The story follows Cadichon's life from his youth through various masters and experiences, teaching moral lessons about kindness, repentance, and the mistreatment of animals. Like many of Ségur's works, it combines entertainment with moral instruction, showing how the donkey was wicked in his youth, suffered for it, and through repentance became reformed and beloved. The book advocates for better treatment of animals while teaching children about virtue and redemption. It is dedicated to her grandson Henri de Ségur.
