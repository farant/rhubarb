I'll analyze this text to identify the work and provide the requested information in TOML format.

This is clearly "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction," a British periodical publication. From the header, I can see this is Volume 12, Number 323, dated Saturday, July 19, 1828. This was a weekly magazine published in London during the 19th century that contained essays, reviews, poetry, and illustrations on various topics of general interest.

The excerpt discusses the establishment of colleges in London (likely referring to University College London and King's College London, which were founded around this time). This is a periodical issue rather than a book by a single author, so it would have had an editor rather than an author in the traditional sense.

Notes = """
The year 1828 is taken directly from the masthead of this specific issue. This periodical had various editors throughout its publication run. The reference to colleges being established in London likely refers to University College London (founded 1826, opened 1828) and King's College London (chartered 1829), which were the first secular institutions of higher education in London.
