I'll analyze this text to identify the work, author, and publication details.

This is clearly "Stories from the Italian Poets: With Lives of the Writers" by Leigh Hunt, published in 1846 (as shown by the Roman numerals MDCCCXLVI on the title page).

Leigh Hunt (1784-1857) was an English essayist, poet, and critic who was instrumental in introducing Italian literature to English readers. This particular work is a collection of retellings and translations from major Italian poets like Dante, Ariosto, and Tasso, along with biographical sketches of these writers.

The dedication to Sir Percy Shelley (son of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley) and the reference to "your Father's Friend" confirms Hunt's close association with the Romantic poets. Hunt was indeed a close friend of Percy Bysshe Shelley and helped introduce Italian poetry to the English Romantic circle.

Notes = """
The year 1846 is clearly indicated on the title page in Roman numerals (MDCCCXLVI). This is a scholarly/literary work rather than original poetry, serving as both an introduction to Italian literature and a work of literary criticism. The dedication to Sir Percy Shelley, son of the poet, provides biographical context about Hunt's relationship with the Romantic circle.
