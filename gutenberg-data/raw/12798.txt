Notes = """
Year is based on the publication date indicated by the Roman numerals MCMI (1901) on the title page. Louis Becke was a prolific writer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and this collection represents his characteristic style of Pacific Island tales. The work is not categorized as "appropriate-for-children" as Becke's stories often dealt with adult themes and the sometimes harsh realities of colonial Pacific life.
