An anthology of Christmas stories and legends compiled by two librarians, Elva S. Smith of Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh and Alice I. Hazeltine of the Public Library in St. Louis. The book is a collection designed for young readers, featuring traditional Christmas tales, legends, and stories that would have been popular in the early 20th century.
