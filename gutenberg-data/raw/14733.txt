Summary = """
Pietari Päivärinta (1827-1913) was a Finnish author and member of the Finnish Diet, known for his realistic portrayals of rural Finnish life in the 19th century. "Elämän Hawainnoita" (Observations of Life) is a multi-volume collection of short stories depicting the hardships and daily realities of Finnish peasant life. This first volume contains four stories: "Uudistalo" (The New Homestead), "Halla-aamuna" (On a Frosty Morning), "Mökin Maiju" (Maiju of the Cottage), and "Noidan rangaistus" (The Witch's Punishment). The excerpt shown is from "Uudistalo," describing a traveler's harrowing winter journey through a desolate, burned-over crown land to reach an isolated homestead.
"""

Notes = """
The publication year 1889 is confirmed by the WSOY Porvoo imprint in the text itself. Päivärinta wrote extensively about Finnish rural life based on his own experiences as a crofter's son. His works are considered important documents of 19th century Finnish peasant culture.
