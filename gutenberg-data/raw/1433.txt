Summary = """
"The Red Inn" (L'Auberge rouge) is a novella by Honoré de Balzac, part of his massive literary project La Comédie humaine. The story is a philosophical tale about guilt, moral responsibility, and the nature of crime. It involves a frame narrative where guests at a dinner party hear the tale of a murder committed at a German inn, raising questions about whether someone can be held morally responsible for a crime they intended to commit but did not actually carry out. The story explores themes of conscience, justice, and the psychological burden of guilt.
