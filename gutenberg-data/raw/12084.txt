Summary = """
"Revelations of a Wife" is an early 20th-century serialized novel by Adele Garrison that follows the story of a newlywed couple navigating the challenges of married life. The work was originally published as a newspaper serial and proved extremely popular with American readers during the 1910s and 1920s. The narrative is told from the perspective of the wife, Margaret, and deals with domestic drama, marital conflicts, and the social expectations of women in the Progressive Era. The book is written in an episodic style typical of newspaper serials, with chapter titles that hint at melodramatic situations like "The First Quarrel" and "A Tragedy Averted."

This type of serialized domestic fiction was immensely popular in American newspapers during this period. The work is not Catholic in nature despite the author's possible personal faith.
