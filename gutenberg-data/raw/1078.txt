Notes = """
Joseph A. Altsheler (1862-1919) was a prolific American author of historical fiction for young adults. The Scouts of the Valley was published in 1911 as part of his Young Trailers series. While Altsheler was personally a Protestant (Presbyterian background from Kentucky), his works are secular adventure fiction without religious content, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply.
