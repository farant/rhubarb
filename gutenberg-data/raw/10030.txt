This is the autobiography of William Frederick Cody (1846-1917), better known as "Buffalo Bill," one of the most famous figures of the American Old West.

Cody served under notable military figures including Generals Sheridan, Carr, Merritt, Crook, and Terry. The autobiography covers his childhood in Kansas during its turbulent territorial period, his work with wagon trains crossing the plains, and his numerous encounters with Native Americans. This work was published during Cody's lifetime while he was already becoming a celebrity, predating his famous Wild West show which would begin in 1883.
