I need to examine this text more carefully to identify the work. Let me read through what's provided.

This is clearly from "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction," which was a Victorian periodical magazine published in London. The specific issue shown is Volume 13, Number 372, dated Saturday, May 30, 1829.

This is not a single authored book but rather a periodical publication - essentially a magazine. The content includes various articles, illustrations, and pieces of writing. The excerpt shows an article about the Epsom New Race Stand.

"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction" was edited by various people over its run, but during this 1829 period, it was likely edited by John Timbs or Thomas Byerley, who were associated with the publication during its early years.
