Summary = """
The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly magazine published from 1822 to 1849. It was one of the first cheap periodicals aimed at a working-class and middle-class readership, featuring a mix of literary excerpts, historical articles, travel writing, illustrations, and miscellaneous entertainment. This particular issue (Vol. 14, No. 402) is a supplementary number featuring content about the Leaning Towers of Bologna and a review of "The Landscape Annual" for 1830, which contained engravings of Italian and Swiss scenery by Samuel Prout.
"""

Notes = """
The year 1829 is chosen because this supplementary issue reviews "The Landscape Annual, London and Paris, 1830" - annuals were typically published in the autumn of the preceding year for gift-giving. Vol. 14 of The Mirror corresponds to the 1829 publication year. The magazine was founded by John Limbird and was notable for making literature and knowledge accessible to ordinary readers at a very low price (2d per issue).
