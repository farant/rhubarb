Summary = """
This is a scholarly paper presented to the Royal Society of Canada examining the origins and early history of the Iroquois Five Nations. Lighthall investigates the mysterious disappearance of the Hochelagans - the indigenous people Jacques Cartier encountered at Hochelaga (near present-day Montreal) in 1535 - and their possible connection to the Mohawks. The paper addresses longstanding questions about where the Iroquois came from before they established themselves in their familiar territory from the Mohawk River westward, and seeks to establish historical links in Iroquois prehistory.
"""

Notes = """
