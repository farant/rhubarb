Notes = """
The year 1903 refers to this collected edition. Runeberg himself lived 1804-1877 and wrote these works throughout his career. "Kung Fjalar" was originally published in 1844, and "Kungarne på Salamis" in 1863. Runeberg wrote in Swedish despite being Finnish, as Swedish was the literary language of educated Finns at that time. He is best known for "The Tales of Ensign Stål" and wrote the lyrics to Finland's national anthem.
