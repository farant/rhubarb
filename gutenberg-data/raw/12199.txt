Summary = """
A collection of historical short stories by American author Mary Hartwell Catherwood focusing on French colonial life in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries. The title story centers on Baron de Saint-Castin, a real historical figure who was a French nobleman and military officer who lived among the Abenaki people in present-day Maine. Catherwood was known for her romanticized but well-researched historical fiction about French colonial America, particularly in the Great Lakes region and New England. These stories explore the interactions between French colonists, trappers, soldiers, and Native American peoples during the colonial period.

Notes = """
The publication year of 1894 is straightforward from the title page. Mary Hartwell Catherwood was not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply despite the French colonial subject matter.
