Seal bar II (annales==acta) failed on the store COPY with "linea
extra in cauda (superset)" while the live store was perfectly
consistent (72=72=72). Cause: `cp tabularium.db scratch/` without
`-wal` — recent transactions still lived in the WAL, so the copy's
acta were a prefix while the copied jsonl was complete. Verificare
honestly named exactly what it saw; the corruption was in my copy
procedure, not the store. Law: verification copies of a WAL-mode
sqlite db = copy db+wal+shm together (or `PRAGMA
wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` first). Same family as the stale-object
traps: the artifact you inspect must actually be the artifact.
