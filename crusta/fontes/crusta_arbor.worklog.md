# crusta_arbor — worklog

Append-only, dated. Finds at find-time for the crusta builder (and the
lector, which has no worklog of its own).

## 2026-09-16 — P2 (lector) and P3 (builder, part one)

**Delayed append of sentences.** materia's lists are append-only
(`materia_valor_lista_appendere`, no removal), so `&&` and `|` cannot
"move the last child into a catena/pipa". The builder therefore keeps a
sentence node (imperium, pipa, catena) in its frame and appends it to
the enclosing list only when the frame CLOSES; `&&` pops the finished
item without appending (`_tollere`), creates the catena, appends the
item to it and pushes the catena frame. Byte order holds because
nothing else is appended to that list while the item is on the stack.
The heredoc placement of P5 will rely on the same invariant: the
separator that ends the line is appended after the item, and the body
goes after the separator.

**A trivium closes an empty assignment.** `a= b`: after the `=` the
assignment frame waits for a value; the blank must close it (value
absent), or the next word lands in it. Found by the arbor gate's
absent-slot row on the first run. The same is NOT true of a redirection:
`2> f` keeps waiting across the blank, as bash does.

**`\r` is an ordinary byte** (lector). bash treats it so: a CRLF script
has words ending in `\r` and a bare `\r` between commands is a command
named `\r`. Being faithful means the newline token is always `\n` alone
and materia's `cr` flag on TERMINATOR tokens never fires for crusta.
Named deviation, pinned in the lector gate.

**Backslash runs inside backticks.** bash strips one backslash level per
backtick depth; toward `$` and `` ` `` a run of n halves (the odd one is
absorbed), toward anything else it rounds up (pairs become one, a
trailing single stays). Tokens keep the raw bytes; the depth rides in
the token's private tail (`CrustaCauda.gravis`); the genus is decided
from the logical count; `crusta_verbum_staticum` strips again to
decode. Continuation and double-quote escapes inside backticks use the
depth-0 rule — a named corner.

**Three continuation flags in the lector** (`titulus_exspectatur`,
`assignationis_gradus` 1/2) survive exactly one pull. They exist because
`$$$x` cannot be lexed by one byte of lookback (`$$` then `$x`), and
because the subscript and `=` of `a[i]=v` are separate tokens after the
name.

**The formator and `#define` runs (quaestio 01M2NNE6WS).** A block of
object-like `#define`s between two functions makes the formator indent
the following definition as a declaration group (column 23). Also, a
one-line `si (...) x = y; alioquin si (...) ...` chain is reflowed into
a cascade of continuation lines. Write every branch as a block; never
put `#define`s between functions.

**Named intermediates in P3** (replaced by P4/P5): `$((` is a literal
part and its `))` become mala; reserved words other than `!` and `time`
are mala; `(` at command position is a malum; `[[`, `((` are mala.
