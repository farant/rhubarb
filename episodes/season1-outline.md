# NOVUM FUNDAMENTUM
## Season 1: "Fundamentum" — Complete Season Outline

### Season Overview

**22 episodes. Theme: Foundation.**

A small team discovers a Borg temporal gate in an abandoned Spanish mission, finds Nova Roma — a Roman colony where time flows differently — and begins rebuilding all foundational software from scratch, in Latin, for a civilization that has never seen a computer. Meanwhile, the Borg's agent Kirk escapes into the world, building a network that threatens everything they're creating.

**Structure:** Each episode has three plot layers:
- **A-Plot (Technical):** A library or system being built. The craft story.
- **B-Plot (Character):** A relationship dynamic, personal arc, or cultural moment.
- **C-Plot (Serialized):** The Kirk/Borg threat escalation and gate mystery.

**Season Arc Shape:**
- **Block 1 (1x01-07):** Establishment. Team forms, Nova Roma discovered, core libraries built.
- **Block 2 (1x08-10):** Deepening. Time mystery surfaces, tools grow more sophisticated.
- **Block 3 (1x11-12):** Mid-Season Crisis. Kirk strikes. The team is tested.
- **Block 4 (1x13-17):** Maturation. Romans become collaborators. Advanced systems. Mythology deepens.
- **Block 5 (1x18-22):** Endgame. Security crisis, final infrastructure, Kirk at the gate.

### Serialized Threads (tracked across all 22 episodes)

**Thread 1: Kirk's Network (The Shadow)**
Kirk escapes after 1x02 and operates off-screen for most of the season. He's building a Borg network on Earth — acquiring companies, compromising people, moving toward the mission gate. He appears on-screen in ~4-5 episodes. Each appearance is brief and chilling. He's charming every time.

| Episode | Kirk Beat |
|---------|----------|
| 1x02 | Exposed and escapes. The misdirect is complete. |
| 1x03-04 | Reports of sightings. He's alive, moving, untraceable. |
| 1x06 | A tech company makes an unusual acquisition. Duncan recognizes the pattern. |
| 1x08-10 | Someone the team trusted goes dark. Intel fragments. Kirk's network growing. |
| 1x11-12 | **Major move.** Kirk's network strikes directly. Brief on-screen appearance — in a suit, in a boardroom, completely human-passing. **No green eyes.** We see Kirk being *Kirk*: charismatic, strategic, in command. The horror is we can't tell where Kirk ends and the Borg begins. ASML connection hinted. |
| 1x14-16 | Aftermath. Deeper underground. New sleeper agents discovered. Paranoia. |
| 1x18 | Kirk intercepted unencrypted transmissions. **He now knows about Nova Roma.** |
| 1x20 | Carter and Data see the pattern — Kirk has been working toward the gate all along. |
| 1x21-22 | **Kirk assaults the mission. Reaches the gate. Steps through to Nova Roma.** Season cliffhanger. |

**Thread 2: The Midas Temporal Mystery (The Ticking Bomb)**
Midas is the reason time flows differently on Nova Roma. He doesn't know it. The audience figures it out before the characters. NOT revealed in Season 1 — the dramatic irony builds.

| Episode | Midas Beat |
|---------|------------|
| 1x05-06 | Small anomaly. Compass spinning near Midas. Carter notices. |
| 1x08 | Clocks between Earth and Nova Roma don't match. Casey's time measurements are off. Carter starts a file. |
| 1x13 | Midas flashback reveals the Phrygian temporal artifact. The audience gets the pieces. Midas doesn't. |
| 1x18-19 | Carter runs more tests. She has a theory she hasn't shared. |
| 1x22 | Carter has a folder labeled "Temporalis Anomalia." She closes it without opening it. |

**Thread 3: Data's Integration (The Outsider)**
Data joins the team in 1x02, mistrusted because of his mechanical nature and Borg-like green eyes. Trust is earned through actions, not words.

| Episode | Data Beat |
|---------|-----------|
| 1x02 | Contained, studied. First words are a warning about Kirk. Joins team. |
| 1x05-06 | **Phase 1: Emotional trust.** Midas is the first person to treat Data as a person, not a machine or threat. Friendship begins. Character presence, no technical contribution yet. |
| 1x08-09 | Data assists with technical work. Quiet competence noticed. |
| 1x11-12 | **Phase 2: Physical trust.** Data interfaces with Borg tech that would kill anyone else. The team watches him take a lethal risk for them. Trust shifts fundamentally. |
| 1x14-16 | Transitional. Quiet technical observations. Carter starts consulting him on design decisions. Begins asking questions about consciousness — parallel to Romans adopting new ways of thinking. |
| 1x19 | **Phase 3: Intellectual trust.** First major technical contribution — leads the JSON implementation. Earned over 17 episodes of slow trust-building. |
| 1x21-22 | Kirk arrives on Nova Roma. Data is the only one who can safely engage with Borg technology. He steps forward. |

**Thread 4: Roman Integration (The Collaboration)**
The Romans go from skeptical observers to active collaborators to independent contributors.

| Episode | Roman Beat |
|---------|------------|
| 1x01-02 | First contact. Armed standoff → cautious welcome. |
| 1x03-04 | Marcus's first "ah" moment. Translation begins. |
| 1x05-07 | Romans learn, question, compare to their own traditions. |
| 1x09-10 | Roman metaphors improve Earth designs. Knowledge flows both ways. |
| 1x13-14 | Joe opens a bar in Nova Roma. Social integration accelerates. |
| 1x15 | **Marcus leads a system design for the first time.** Carter defers to him. |
| 1x17-18 | Roman testers trained by Teal'c find flaws the Earth team missed. |
| 1x21-22 | Marcus and the Roman engineers are essential to the finale deployment. Not assistants — partners. |

### Episode Guide

---

#### 1x01 — "Piscina: Capacitas Nova" (New Capacity)
**Status:** Fully outlined (see 1x01-piscina-capacitas-nova.md)

**A-Plot:** SG-1 tracks Borg activity to a poker game, kills a golem, meets Duncan MacLeod. Duncan reveals the Borg threat. Alliance with Immortals (Casey, Methos). Assault on the Spanish mission. Discovery of the temporal Stargate. Through the gate to Nova Roma. Meeting Midas, Pliny, Marcus. Carter identifies memory allocation as the foundation. The first code: `structura Piscina`.

**B-Plot:** Team formation. SG-1 meets Immortals. Duncan's resurrection reveals Immortality. Nova Roma discovered — a clean, uncompromised civilization.

**C-Plot:** Stinger — Data and Kirk arrive on Earth via temporal displacement. Data: damaged, green-eyed, mechanical. Kirk: gasping, vulnerable, human. *The audience thinks Data is the threat and Kirk is the hero.* The misdirect begins.

**Tag:** Carter and Casey at dawn. "This is the first time I've thought we might actually pull it off." *Piscina est fundamentum.*

---

#### 1x02 — "Credo" (I Believe / I Trust)
**Status:** Sketched (see notes in 1x01 document)

**A-Plot:** First tests of Piscina. Introduction of the Credo testing framework. Teal'c writes the test suites with terrifying thoroughness. "A warrior does not trust his weapon until he has tested it in conditions of failure."

**B-Plot:** Kirk arrives at the mission — charming, traumatized, helpful. Data is contained, studied by Carter. She notices his damage patterns match *fighting* Borg, not *being* Borg. Data can't speak initially. When repaired, his first word is a warning.

**C-Plot:** **The Reversal.** Kirk is exposed. His eyes glow green. He escapes into the world. Data joins the team. Everything the audience assumed in the stinger was backwards. Trust must be verified, not assumed. *Credo* means "I trust" — but the framework is about verification. The whole episode asks: how do you test who to trust?

**Theme:** Trust through verification. The testing framework as epistemology.

---

#### 1x03 — "Verba Nova" (New Words)
**Library:** Chorda (strings) + Chorda Aedificator (string builder)

**A-Plot:** Daniel and Lucia Serena clash over how to represent text in the new system. Daniel approaches Latin as a translation problem — converting English computing concepts. Lucia corrects him: "You are putting your thoughts in our words. That is not language. That is costume." The Romans don't have "strings" — they have *chordae*, strings of a lyre. The metaphor teaches that text is music, not data. Length-prefixed, not null-terminated — because the Romans' instinct (a cord has a known length) is actually superior to Earth's convention. Act 2 escalation: you need to *build* strings piece by piece (the aedificator). Act 3: they generate the first structured report for the Nova Roma senate.

**B-Plot:** Daniel's arc begins — translator → language architect. Lucia establishes herself as his intellectual equal. Carter/Marcus mentor dynamic continues. O'Neill catches a trivial bug in code review. Played for comedy. He claims it was luck.

**C-Plot:** Reports of Kirk sightings. He's alive, moving. They can't track him. The team can't follow up — too busy building.

**Key Characters:** Daniel, Lucia Serena, Carter, Marcus

---

#### 1x04 — "Codex Tabulae Exponentialis" (The Growing Ledger)
**Library:** Xar (variable-length array)

**A-Plot:** Marcus Ferrarius needs to track a growing census of Nova Roma's citizens. Carter shows him an array that grows like a Roman road — adding new sections without tearing up the old. The Xar never reallocates — elements stay where they are, stable addresses forever. Growth without destruction. Roman engineering built roads that lasted millennia by *adding* layers, not replacing what came before.

**B-Plot:** Marcus's engineering intuition proves valuable. His Roman metaphors illuminate computing concepts — he's not just learning, he's translating, and the translation improves the original. Duncan watches Casey and Carter building something and realizes he's been fighting things his whole life but rarely building them.

**C-Plot:** More Kirk sightings. He's establishing himself somewhere. Unease grows.

**Key Characters:** Marcus, Carter, Duncan

---

#### 1x05 — "Tabularium Novum" (The New Archive)
**Library:** Tabula Dispersa (hash table) + Friatio (hash functions — FNV-1a only; cryptographic hashing deferred to 1x18)

**A-Plot:** Pliny's forty-volume *Naturalis Historia Nova* needs to be searchable. Building the index forces the team to confront: how do you organize all of human knowledge when you're starting from scratch? Carter introduces hashing — *friatio*, crumbling something into a fingerprint. The hash table is built using the hash functions. Collisions, load factors, diagnostics. Act 3: Pliny searches his forty volumes instantly. His life's work, organized.

**B-Plot:** Pliny spotlight — eighty years of questions, now getting answers. Casey and Pliny bond over the weight of long memory. Teal'c writes a test that fails in a way nobody expected — reveals a design assumption nobody questioned. "A test that only confirms what you believe is not a test."

**C-Plot:** First Midas temporal anomaly. A compass spins near him. Carter notices but doesn't connect it yet. Midas is oblivious.

**Key Characters:** Pliny, Casey, Teal'c, Midas

---

#### 1x06 — "Unum Pro Omnibus" (One For All)
**Library:** Internamentum (string interning)

**A-Plot:** As the codebase grows, Methos notices they're storing the same strings thousands of times. His solution — keep one canonical copy of each unique string, compare by pointer instead of content. The debate: when is something "the same"? If two people say the same word, is it one word or two? A philosophical question that maps to a technical one. The mirror of the Borg: they *assimilate*, making everything identical. We *intern*, making things canonical while preserving their source. Different philosophy, similar efficiency.

**B-Plot:** Methos accidentally reveals knowledge about the fall of Alexandria that makes Daniel stop dead. "You were THERE?" Methos has been treating his memory as a burden. Daniel treats it as treasure. Data and Midas friendship deepening — Midas is the only person who treats Data as a person from day one.

**C-Plot:** A tech company on Earth makes an unusual acquisition. Duncan recognizes the pattern — Kirk's network is taking shape. More Midas anomalies — a clock running slow near him. Carter notes it.

**Key Characters:** Methos, Daniel, Data, Midas

---

#### 1x07 — "Tabulae Ceratae" (Wax Tablets)
**Library:** Filum (file I/O)

**A-Plot:** The team needs to save their work between sessions. Teaching the Romans about files reveals that the concept of "saving" is actually ancient — wax tablets that could be erased and reused (temporary) vs. stone inscriptions that lasted millennia (permanent). When do you write to wax vs. stone? Read whole files, read by lines, write, append, directory operations.

**B-Plot:** Pliny and O'Neill odd couple dynamic. O'Neill asks "why can't I just write it down?" — a question that's both frustratingly simple and profoundly correct. Joe Dawson frames the whole episode with the Watcher's question: "How do you make sure what you write survives?" The Watcher as filesystem — someone whose entire life is about preserving records. Joe and Pliny meet and recognize each other instantly — two documentarians, one immortal's chronicler, one civilization's chronicler. The friendship of the season begins.

**C-Plot:** Quiet episode for the Kirk thread. Background tension only.

**Key Characters:** Pliny, O'Neill, Joe Dawson

---

#### 1x08 — "Horologium" (The Clock)
**Library:** Tempus (time management — frame timing, easing, interpolation, animation)

**A-Plot:** Casey tries to synchronize clocks between Earth and Nova Roma. The readings don't match. Not by a little — by a lot. The time dilation isn't constant; it fluctuates. Casey's obsessive precision (born from decades of building systems alone) meets a problem he can't solve through precision alone. Building the Tempus library while living in a place where time is warped forces the fundamental question: what does "time" even mean?

**B-Plot:** **Casey flashback episode.** Woven through the Tempus A-plot, not competing with it. Casey's IBM tabulating machine days. Watching computing go from punch cards to mainframes to the web. The Web3 blockchain DAO SaaS startup — his breaking point. "That's when I knew it was over. Not just the project. The whole industry." His retreat to the desert. Thirty years alone, building clean systems. His obsessive relationship with *time* — a man who's lived 200 years, watching an industry measure progress in quarters. The flashbacks *serve* the Tempus story: Casey's lifetime of watching technology's relationship with time gives him the insight to spot the anomaly.

**C-Plot:** Someone the team trusted on Earth goes dark. Kirk's network is growing. The time discrepancy between Earth and Nova Roma isn't just a scientific curiosity — every day on Nova Roma costs them multiple days on Earth. The invasion clock ticks faster from their perspective. Carter starts a file on the temporal anomaly.

**Key Characters:** Casey, Carter, Midas (oblivious)

**Tag:** Casey alone with his measurements. Something doesn't add up. He looks toward where Midas is laughing with a group of Romans. He looks back at his numbers. He doesn't connect it. But we do.

---

#### 1x09 — "Arbor Documentorum" (Tree of Documents)
**Library:** XML (parser/serializer, DOM tree, elements, attributes)

**A-Plot:** Pliny wants to encode his *Naturalis Historia Nova* in a machine-readable format. The team introduces structured markup — documents as trees. The Romans understand trees: family trees, hierarchies of command, organizational structures. A document as a tree is intuitive. XML is self-describing — the format carries its own documentation. Pliny grasps this immediately: "A scroll that explains itself. Every scholar's dream."

**B-Plot:** Daniel and Pliny — scholar to scholar across 2000 years. Pliny's documentation philosophy becomes the template for the whole project. O'Neill catches something real in the XML structure — Carter is genuinely impressed. "How did you see that?" "It didn't read right." He's paying more attention than he pretends.

**C-Plot:** Intel fragments about Kirk's network. Growing unease. Kirk is acquiring capabilities, not just people.

**Key Characters:** Pliny, Daniel, O'Neill, Carter

---

#### 1x10 — "Lingua Nova Structurae" (New Language of Structure)
**Library:** STML (XML superset — boolean attributes, raw content, capture operators, fragments, transclusion)

**A-Plot:** Carter finds XML too limiting for the interfaces they need to build. Rather than starting over, she extends it — STML. Simpler where XML was needlessly complex, more powerful where XML fell short. Building on the past rather than abandoning it. The "we outgrow our tools" episode. Capture operators, fragments, transclusion — each feature is dramatically interesting because each represents a real limitation overcome.

**B-Plot:** **Lucia Serena's second major moment.** When STML extends XML, Lucia is the one who sees the philosophical significance: "You've given the language room to grow." She understands extensibility as a concept before the engineers understand it technically. Carter/Marcus mentor dynamic deepens — Marcus is starting to push back on Carter's designs, not from ignorance but from understanding. Daniel coins a term that enters Roman daily vocabulary naturally. His first linguistic creation that *lives*.

**C-Plot:** Kirk's network growing. A report that someone connected to ASML has gone missing. Duncan's pattern recognition kicks in — "This is organized. This isn't one person."

**Key Characters:** Carter, Marcus, Lucia, Daniel

---

#### 1x11 — "Praeparate, Pars Prima" (Prepare, Part One)
**Library:** Nuntium (protobuf-style binary serialization) — crisis-driven B-plot

**A-Plot:** **Kirk's network strikes.** A coordinated attack on multiple fronts. Not at the mission directly — at the infrastructure around it. Communications disrupted. Allies compromised. The team is forced to split: Earth defense and Nova Roma continuity. We SEE Kirk on-screen for the first time since 1x02 — brief, chilling. He's in a suit, in a boardroom. Completely human-passing. **No green eyes.** We see Kirk being *Kirk*: charismatic, strategic, in command. The horror is that we can't tell where Kirk ends and the Borg begins. The man who beat the Kobayashi Maru has a plan. Save the green eyes for the finale — when they finally glow in 1x22, it lands like a gut punch because we almost forgot what he is.

**B-Plot:** Under crisis pressure, the team needs secure binary communications that Kirk can't easily intercept or decode. Nuntium — compact, binary, wire-typed. The Roman military dispatch analogy: coded messages for speed and security. Teal'c and Marcus build it under fire. The Nuntium library is born from necessity, not curriculum.

**C-Plot:** ASML connection hinted at more directly. The scope of Kirk's network is larger than anyone realized. He's not just building a team — he's building infrastructure. Borg infrastructure. The "praeparate" message from the pilot echoes — someone was trying to warn them. Or was it Kirk all along?

**Key Characters:** Kirk, Carter, Teal'c, Marcus, Duncan

**Cliffhanger:** The team is split. Carter and half the group are on Nova Roma. Duncan and O'Neill are on Earth, fighting Kirk's network. Communications are down. Each side doesn't know if the other survived.

---

#### 1x12 — "Praeparate, Pars Altera" (Prepare, Part Two)
**Library:** Nuntium completion

**A-Plot:** Resolution of the mid-season crisis. Both teams survive, reconnect through the Nuntium protocol they built under pressure. Kirk is driven back but NOT caught. He's demonstrated capability — he can threaten them directly. He chose not to take the gate. Why? Because he's not ready yet. He's still building. That's more terrifying than if he'd tried and failed.

**B-Plot:** The cost is counted. An ally is lost. Trust is damaged — who else has Kirk compromised? Carter realizes the time dilation means every day they spend recovering on Nova Roma costs them days on Earth. The marathon vs. sprint tension crystallizes. Data proves essential — his immunity to Borg tech lets him safely analyze what Kirk left behind. He finds fragments of Borg code that match the damage patterns from his own time travel.

**C-Plot:** Teal'c begins training Romans in testing methodology. Not just software testing — threat assessment. The Jaffa warrior discipline meets Roman military tradition. They're compatible.

**Key Characters:** Ensemble — everyone has a role in the resolution

**Tag:** Quiet aftermath. The team together in Pliny's villa. Battered but intact. Casey: "We need to build faster." Carter: "No. We need to build *better*. Fast gets people killed." Casey considers this. Nods. "Yeah. Okay. Better."

---

#### 1x13 — "Aurum" (Gold)
**Library:** None — pure mythology/character episode

**A-Plot:** **Midas flashback.** Phrygia, 8th century BC. Young Midas encounters something ancient — a temporal artifact, maybe Borg-derived, maybe something older. The "golden touch" legend reinterpreted: ancient people describing someone who was temporally unstable. Things around him aging wrong, transmuting, becoming other. Phasing in and out. He learned to control it — or it settled — but the effect never fully stopped. We see his exile, his wandering through Greek civilization, watching Rome rise. His accidental arrival in Nova Roma through the gate — a political enemy, "a misunderstanding about taxation." Eighty years of building a community. Three generations of Romans who know him as a strange, kind, ageless friend.

**B-Plot:** In the present, post-crisis. The team is recovering. Joe Dawson opens a bar in Nova Roma. Because of course he does. It becomes the social hub where Romans and Earth people talk as equals, after hours, over drinks. The bar as critical social infrastructure. Joe's natural habitat. The bar becomes a recurring set from here forward.

**C-Plot:** Carter reviews her temporal anomaly data. The Midas flashback gives the audience the pieces — the artifact, the temporal instability, his presence on Nova Roma for eighty years. We understand. Carter almost understands. She files it away. Not yet.

**Key Characters:** Midas, Joe Dawson

**Tag:** Midas and Data, sitting outside the bar. Midas is telling a story about Aristotle. Data is listening with genuine attention. Two beings who are more important than anyone realizes, finding friendship in the quiet. The audience knows. They don't.

---

#### 1x14 — "Invenire et Eligere" (Find and Choose)
**Library:** Selectio (CSS selector engine for STML trees)

**A-Plot:** With STML documents growing complex, the team needs a way to find specific parts without reading everything. Tag, ID, class, attribute selectors. Combinators. The Roman legal tradition of *quaestio* — formal inquiry — maps perfectly. A selector is a question: "find all elements matching these criteria." Teal'c's queries are legendarily thorough. Daniel designs the query language with Lucia's input.

**B-Plot:** Teal'c spotlight in the B-plot. His testing methodology training with the Romans bears fruit — a Roman student writes a query that even Teal'c finds elegant. The Jaffa discipline translated to Roman engineering culture. A sleeper agent is discovered in the SGC back on Earth — someone they'd trusted for years. Paranoia ripples through the team. The Selectio work takes on new meaning: how do you find something hidden in something complex?

**C-Plot:** Kirk's network has gone deeper underground after the mid-season crisis. Harder to detect. The paranoia from the sleeper agent discovery spreads.

**Key Characters:** Teal'c, Daniel, Lucia

---

#### 1x15 — "Aquaeductus" (The Aqueduct)
**Library:** TCP (networking — client, server, non-blocking I/O)

**A-Plot:** The team establishes the first computer-to-computer connection on Nova Roma. The aqueduct was Rome's greatest infrastructure achievement — clean water flowing reliably from source to destination. TCP is the digital aqueduct: reliable, ordered delivery of data between two points. Marcus sees the parallel instantly. He doesn't just understand the concept — he improves the analogy, catching edge cases the Earth team glossed over.

**B-Plot:** **Marcus leads a system design for the first time.** Carter deliberately steps back. Not because she can't do it, but because Marcus will be maintaining this for decades. The student's judgment matters more than the teacher's. This is Carter's turning point 3 — deferring to Marcus. The teacher letting the student take the lead. It works. Carter's proudest moment.

**C-Plot:** Connections can be severed. And someone might be listening. The networking episode raises the first real security concerns. Foreshadowing for the TLS crisis in 1x18.

**Key Characters:** Marcus, Carter, Casey

---

#### 1x16 — "Vigiles" (The Night Watch)
**Library:** Reactor (single-threaded event loop, poll()-based I/O multiplexing)

**A-Plot:** As more Romans connect to the network, one thread can't serve them by waiting on each in turn. The *vigiles* were Rome's watchmen — one person monitoring many streets, responding to whoever needed help first. A reactor does the same: one thread, many connections, responding to events as they arrive. The concept of event-driven programming through the lens of Roman civic duty.

**B-Plot:** **Teal'c spotlight.** He recognizes something in the event loop's patient, alert waiting — it's *kel'no'reem*, the Jaffa meditation of readiness. Not passive. Not active. *Ready.* Alert to everything, responding to what matters. Casey and Teal'c working side by side — two very different people who share a belief in disciplined attention. Some of the show's best quiet scenes.

**C-Plot:** Kirk intercepts a transmission. We don't see it happen — we see the evidence later. The team doesn't know yet. The audience suspects. Tension builds toward the TLS crisis.

**Key Characters:** Teal'c, Casey, Marcus

---

#### 1x17 — "Quinque Milia Annorum" (Five Thousand Years)
**Library:** None — mythology/character episode

**A-Plot:** **Methos flashback.** Not the famous Library of Alexandria — something worse, something personal. A collection of knowledge Methos assembled over centuries, in a city whose name has been forgotten. He watched it burn. Not to invaders — to neglect. Nobody maintained the building. Nobody copied the scrolls. The knowledge died because preservation wasn't anyone's job. Intercut with present-day: Methos reluctantly contributing to Nova Roma's documentation system. He's writing things down. He's participating. When someone calls him on it: "I have notes. Several scrolls' worth, actually. Most of them are warnings." But now the warnings come with solutions.

**B-Plot:** Methos and Pliny — two old men, one immortal, one mortal, sharing wine and manuscripts in Joe's bar. The friendship that has been building all season reaches its emotional peak. Pliny asks: "How do you bear it? Watching knowledge die, knowing you'll outlive every book?" Methos: "You don't bear it. You just keep writing."

**C-Plot:** The Ra connection is seeded. Methos's flashback contains a detail — an artifact in the lost library that looks like a Goa'uld device. Daniel notices when Methos describes it. Files it away. Season 2 thread planted.

**Key Characters:** Methos, Pliny, Daniel, Joe

**Tag:** Methos alone in Pliny's library. He picks up a scroll. Starts reading. Starts *annotating*. Adding his own notes. Five thousand years of memory, finally being written down. Not because he has to. Because it matters.

---

#### 1x18 — "Arcanum" (The Secret)
**Library:** TLS (encrypted connections, secure handshake) + Base64 (encoding — B-plot)

**A-Plot:** **Bottle episode.** Kirk has intercepted their unencrypted transmissions between Earth and Nova Roma. **He now knows about Nova Roma.** The team locks down. No one in, no one out until they can secure communications. The episode takes place almost entirely in the mission and Pliny's villa — two locations, one tense night. They must build encryption from scratch. The Romans had sealed letters, wax impressions, trusted couriers — TLS is the digital version. But who certifies the certifier? The conversation about trust echoes the pilot's themes.

**B-Plot:** Base64 encoding as practical necessity — they need to embed encrypted binary data in text messages. O'Neill asks "why can't you just send the data?" Casey explains the difference between a message that's readable and one that's just transmittable. Classic SG-1 dynamic: Jack's dumb question isn't dumb. Duncan's centuries of spy tradecraft inform the security design — he's seen every way secrets get compromised. Carter runs more temporal anomaly tests during the lockdown. She has a theory. She doesn't share it.

**C-Plot:** Kirk now knows about Nova Roma. The stakes have changed fundamentally. Everything before this was building in relative safety. Now they're building while being watched.

**Key Characters:** Carter, Duncan, Casey, O'Neill

---

#### 1x19 — "Nuntii Structurati" (Structured Messages)
**Library:** JSON (parser, builder, objects, arrays, serialization)

**A-Plot:** The systems they've built need to talk to each other — not just binary dispatches (Nuntium) but human-readable structured data. JSON as the *lingua franca* between modules. While Nuntium was built under crisis pressure (compact, efficient, military), JSON is built with breathing room (readable, flexible, interoperable). The contrast between wartime and peacetime engineering.

**B-Plot:** **Data's first major technical contribution.** He leads the JSON implementation — his pattern recognition and precision make him ideal for the parser. This is a turning point in team trust. Data isn't just the Borg-immune interface anymore; he's a software engineer. A colleague. The Romans who were afraid of him begin asking him questions. A Roman student uses a term Daniel invented in a way Daniel didn't anticipate — extending the metaphor, creating new meaning. The language is growing beyond its creators.

**C-Plot:** Carter and Data see the *pattern* in Kirk's movements on Earth — but only because Joe Dawson's Watcher records reveal the connections. His meticulous documentation of Immortal activity inadvertently tracked Kirk's network. The historian as intelligence asset. Kirk's acquisitions, compromised agents, probes of their defenses — they all point in one direction. He's been working toward the gate. Everything else was positioning.

**Key Characters:** Data, Carter, Daniel, Joe Dawson

---

#### 1x20 — "Compressio" (Compression)
**Library:** Flatura (DEFLATE/gzip — Huffman trees, sliding window)

**A-Plot:** Nova Roma's digital infrastructure is going live. Bandwidth is the bottleneck — limited connections, limited storage, limited time. Compression is the art of saying the same thing with fewer words. It works because data has structure, repetition, predictability — patterns. Finding and exploiting patterns. Huffman encoding as frequency analysis. The sliding window as short-term memory. The Romans understand this intuitively: Latin rhetoric was built on compression — saying maximum meaning in minimum words.

**B-Plot:** The pattern theme connects to Kirk. Carter's analysis of his movements follows the same logic as compression: find the structure, find the repetition, predict what comes next. O'Neill catches a critical flaw in the compression implementation that would have corrupted data during the finale deployment. He still claims it was luck. Nobody believes him anymore.

**C-Plot:** Kirk is moving. The pattern analysis is clear: he's coming for the gate. The team begins preparing. Midas temporal anomaly: Carter has a theory. She doesn't open the folder. Not now. There's no time.

**Key Characters:** Carter, O'Neill, Data, Marcus

**Tag:** Gaius Tertius shows Carter something with lenses — a breakthrough in optics that makes her eyes go wide. Roman glassmaking → precision optics. The seed of the hardware track. "You made this?" "Glass is what I know. I just asked it a different question." The knowledge transfer goes both ways. Season 2-3 thread planted.

---

#### 1x21 — "Forum Digitale, Pars Prima" (The Digital Forum, Part One)
**Library:** HTTP (client, server, request parsing, response building)

**A-Plot:** The culmination. Every library built this season comes together. HTTP is the protocol of the digital forum — the public square where all of civilization happens. The team builds the first web server on Nova Roma. Every piece of infrastructure they've laid — memory allocation, strings, data structures, file I/O, networking, security, serialization, compression — flows into this moment. Marcus and the Roman engineers are essential. Not assistants — partners.

**B-Plot:** **Ensemble episode — everyone's work converges.** Carter and Casey deploy collaboratively. Not Casey's code alone — team code. He's proud of it. "This is what I was trying to build alone for thirty years. Turns out you need people." Duncan has chosen to stay and protect the building rather than hunt Kirk. Defense over offense. His first time making that choice in four centuries.

**C-Plot:** **Kirk assaults the mission.** His network strikes simultaneously on multiple fronts. The Earth team is overwhelmed. O'Neill and Duncan hold the mission perimeter. But Kirk isn't trying to destroy — he's trying to *get through*. He's been building toward this for twenty episodes.

**Cliffhanger:** Kirk reaches the gate room. The event horizon shimmers. He smiles. He steps through.

**Key Characters:** Full ensemble

#### 1x22 — "Fundamentum" (The Foundation)
**Library:** HTTP completion — first page served on Nova Roma

**A-Plot:** Kirk is on Nova Roma. The threat they've been building against is now inside the walls. But this episode isn't a battle — it's a deployment. The first web page loads. Marcus types a URL and sees a page rendered from data stored in their systems — every library, every module, every piece of the foundation working together. The "Marcus's 'ah' moment" of the season. The entire foundation coming together. The infrastructure goes live across Nova Roma even as Kirk moves through the colony.

**B-Plot:** The team must protect Nova Roma and complete the deployment simultaneously. Data steps forward — he's the only one who can safely engage with Borg technology. Kirk and Data face each other. Kirk recognizes Data. "You came back to warn them. How noble. How predictable." Data: "You were James Kirk. I have read the histories. You were a hero." Kirk: "I was. And look what it got me." The tragic dimension planted — somewhere inside, the real Kirk might still exist. Data believes so.

**C-Plot:** Kirk is contained but not defeated. He's seen Nova Roma. He's seen what they're building. He transmits something before he's stopped — a signal, brief and encoded, aimed at the stars. The Borg now know about Nova Roma. The invasion clock just got shorter.

**Final Sequence — Two images that rhyme:**

**IMAGE 1: Joe's Bar, Nova Roma. Night.**

Everyone is here. The bar that Joe opened in 1x13 has become the heart of Nova Roma, and for one moment everyone is in the same room.

Carter and Casey at a table, the first HTTP page glowing on an old laptop between them. Marcus behind them, pointing at something on screen — his contribution, something *he* designed. Daniel and Lucia close together, not touching, translating something, heads bent over the same scroll. Teal'c at the bar, saying nothing, drinking something Roman. Midas telling a story to three Romans and O'Neill, all of them laughing. Duncan watching from the doorway, half-smile. Joe behind the bar, writing something down. Data listening to Midas, attentive, almost warm.

It's warm. It's earned. Twenty episodes of work and trust and building, and it feels like it might be enough.

Casey: "The foundation's laid."

Carter: "*Fundamentum positum est.*"

Outside the bar, Methos sits alone under the stars. Pliny finds him.

**PLINY:** You're not celebrating.

**METHOS:** I've celebrated the completion of great works before. *(beat)* I always wonder which part we got wrong.

**PLINY:** *(sitting beside him)* Then write it down. So when they find it, they'll know where to look.

Methos looks at Pliny. Really looks at him. This mortal man, old and running out of time, who has spent eighty years writing everything down just in case someone comes who needs it.

**METHOS:** *(quietly)* I have notes. Several scrolls' worth.

**PLINY:** Then let us begin.

Carter, inside the bar, opens a folder on the table. "Temporalis Anomalia." She looks at the data. She looks through the window at Midas, laughing, alive, beloved by everyone in the room.

She closes the folder.

Not yet.

**IMAGE 2: The Mission, Earth. Night.**

Hard cut. Silent. The adobe walls. The bell tower. Moonlight.

Then movement in the shadows. Green eyes — the first time they've glowed since 1x02. Kirk walks through the gate room. Not running. Walking. Confident. He knows exactly where he's going.

The event horizon shimmers.

He steps through.

SMASH TO BLACK.

Two images of people stepping into the next chapter. One warm, one cold. One building, one destroying. Season 2 is the collision.

**Post-Credits Stinger:** Deep space. Silent. A signal propagating outward from Nova Roma — Kirk's earlier transmission. It reaches... something. A shadow. Vast. Green lights beginning to glow in the darkness.

They heard.

SMASH TO BLACK.

END OF SEASON ONE.

*"We are not building software. We are building the foundation of a civilization. Every function, every test, every comment is a brick in a structure that must stand for centuries. The Romans did it with stone. We do it with code."*

*"Fundamentum positum est."*

— Colonel Samantha Carter, 1x22
