### Beat Sheet (Draft 3)

---

## COLD OPEN

**Location:** Earth. Upscale private poker room - Monaco vibes. Crystal, dark wood, soft lighting. The kind of place where very serious people do very quiet business. Night.

**Setup:** SG-1 (Carter, Daniel, Teal'c) has been running an Earth-side intelligence operation for a year. They've been tracking someone - communications anomalies, unexplained deaths, technology behaving strangely. Tonight they finally have him at a table.

**The scene:** They're dressed up. Formal wear. Carter in evening dress, Daniel in a tailored suit, Teal'c imposing in black tie. They don't look like soldiers. They look like high-stakes players.

Texas hold 'em. But the real game is the conversation.

The TARGET sits across from them. Composed. Wealthy-looking. He's been playing this role for years - decades maybe. A man with connections, with access, with influence.

**The conversation:** Coded. Circling. They're feeling each other out through bets and small talk. But slowly, SG-1 closes the net. Carter mentions an operation. Daniel references a name. Teal'c says nothing but watches.

The target realizes, piece by piece, that they know. They know *what* he is, even if they don't know the word for it yet.

**The tell:** He laughs quietly. To himself. Resigned but almost amused.

**CARTER:** The only thing I haven't figured out is you. Who are you?

Beat. He sets down his cards.

**TARGET:** *(quiet, almost gentle)* Borg.

**The transformation:** His eyes begin to glow. Green. Not the blue-white of Goa'uld, not the gold of ascension. *Green*. Then his mouth. Light bleeding from inside him.

Everything electronic in the room - phones on the table, security cameras, the card shuffler, tablets, earpieces - starts to *move*. Metal and wire and glass pulling toward him, assembling around him. A technology golem forming from the detritus of modern life.

He's not controlling it remotely. He's *merged* with it. The sympathetic damage is visible - when they shoot the golem, he flinches. When they hit a critical mass of circuitry, he bleeds.

**The fight:** Brief and brutal. The golem attacks. SG-1 responds with gunfire. The golem staggers as the man staggers. They destroy enough of it that he collapses - man and machine together, the green light fading from his eyes.

He's dead. The golem is junk. Phones and tablets and wires scattered across the poker table like a losing hand.

**The aftermath:** Silence. Heavy breathing. They search the body. Find keys.

**DANIEL:** What did he say? "Borg?" What does that mean?

**CARTER:** I don't know.

They move to a door at the back of the room. His private office. The place they've been trying to get to for a year.

**The door:** They unlock it. Step through.

A man is already there, going through files. Calm. Professional. Like he belongs here more than they do.

He turns.

**CARTER:** Who are you?

**DUNCAN:** I'm Duncan MacLeod.

Said like it should mean something. It doesn't. To them.

SMASH TO MAIN TITLES

---

## ACT ONE: "Capacitas"

*The capacity to hold information. The audience's capacity expanding to hold two universes.*

### Beat 1: Standoff

Immediate tension. SG-1 has weapons on Duncan. He's not afraid. Professional respect between people who recognize competence.

Duncan: "You're SGC. Took you long enough."

He's been tracking them too. He knows who they are. They don't know what he is.

### Beat 2: The Exchange

Careful negotiation. Duncan offers information. He's been working this problem longer than they have. Decades, not months.

He starts explaining: the invasion isn't coming. It's already here. Infrastructure level. The advance work has been happening for thirty years. Backdoors in hardware. Compromised supply chains. Sleeper protocols in software that runs everything.

"In ten to twenty years, they arrive. And when they do, they press a button and every system you depend on turns against you. Power grids. Communications. Water treatment. The machines you've taught to run your civilization will be the weapons that end it."

### Beat 3: Skepticism

Daniel and Carter push back. This is conspiracy thinking. Where's the evidence?

Duncan: "Your informant. The one who just died. How long did you trust him?"

They're shaken. He was vetted. Years of service.

Duncan: "There are more. Everywhere. You've been compromised at every level. The question isn't who you can trust. The question is whether you can trust *anything with a microchip*."

### Beat 4: The Borg Files

Duncan gestures to what he's been examining. Strange artifacts on the desk. Tablet-like objects covered in markings that look almost like cuneiform - ancient, weathered, but somehow *wrong*. Too regular. Too precise.

Daniel is drawn to them. "These markings... they're not any language I recognize. But the structure..."

Duncan: "I've been tracking these for decades. They show up in strange places. Archaeological sites. Corporate vaults. Private collections. Always connected to the pattern I've been following."

Carter: "What are they?"

Duncan: "I was hoping you could tell me."

A REDSHIRT - junior SGC operative who came with them - moves closer. Pulls out his phone to photograph the tablets for analysis.

Duncan sees it too late: "Wait - don't -"

The phone's camera activates. The tablet *reacts*. The cuneiform markings begin to glow. Green.

The phone pulls toward the tablet. Or the tablet toward the phone. They *want* to connect.

Contact.

The redshirt's eyes flash green. Instant. No transition. One moment human, the next - not.

### Beat 5: Infection and Resurrection

The infected redshirt draws his weapon. Starts firing. Not randomly - *targeted*. He knows who the threats are.

Duncan moves without thinking. Puts himself between the gunfire and Carter. Takes multiple rounds to the chest.

He goes down hard.

Teal'c neutralizes the redshirt - staff weapon, brutal, efficient. The green light fades from the operative's eyes as he collapses.

Carter rushes to Duncan. Checks vitals. He's dead. Clearly dead. Multiple gunshot wounds.

**CARTER:** He's gone.

Daniel stares at the tablets. The glow has faded. They look inert again. Ancient. Harmless.

**DANIEL:** What the hell just happened?

Beat. Silence.

Duncan gasps. His eyes fly open.

He sits up, touching his chest. The wounds are closing. The bullets pushing out of his flesh.

**DUNCAN:** *(catching his breath)* That's going to be complicated to explain.

SG-1's worldview cracks open. Again. They've seen aliens, gods, ascended beings. But a human who doesn't die?

Daniel, fastest to connect: "The Watchers. The chronicles of immortals. I thought those were myths. Classified speculation."

Duncan: "Not myths. And there are others. Older than me. If we're going to survive what's coming, you need to meet them."

He looks at the tablets. At the dead redshirt.

Duncan: "And now you've seen how it spreads. Ancient technology meets modern. That's the trigger. That's how they've been seeding this planet for centuries. Waiting for you to build the infrastructure they need."

END ACT ONE

---

## ACT TWO: "Nova"

*New. The new plan. The new alliance. The new threat fully revealed.*

### Beat 6: Methos

New location. Somewhere unexpected - a bar, a university office, a bookshop. Methos's territory.

Duncan brings SG-1 to meet him. Methos is unimpressed.

"You want to save the world. Again. How many times is this for you, MacLeod? Third? Fourth?"

But when Duncan explains the scope - infrastructure compromise, invasion timeline, the systematic hollowing-out of human civilization - Methos gets serious.

"Ah. So not a battle. An extinction."

### Beat 7: Historical Parallel

Methos explains what he's seen. Five thousand years of civilizations rising and falling.

"You want to know how Rome fell? It didn't fall. It was hollowed out. The legions were still marching when the empire was already dead inside. The bureaucracy that built it became the tool that dismembered it. The roads that connected it became the paths for invasion."

Carter: "You're saying our infrastructure is our vulnerability."

Methos: "I'm saying your infrastructure is *already* the enemy's weapon. They're just waiting to pull the trigger."

### Beat 8: The Impossible Choice

The team processes. What do you do when you can't trust any of your tools?

Carter, working through it: "We'd have to rebuild everything. From scratch. Operating systems, compilers, the entire software stack. Clean room implementation. Every line of code audited."

Daniel: "That would take decades."

Carter: "We have ten to twenty years."

Methos: "Then you'd better start now. And you'd better have somewhere to deploy it that isn't already compromised."

### Beat 9: Nova Roma

Carter remembers something. Old mission files. A gate address that was logged and filed away as low priority.

"There's a world. P3X-something. A Roman expedition went through two thousand years ago. They built a colony. We made contact briefly, classified it as 'primitive, no strategic value.'"

Daniel: "No technology. No infrastructure to compromise."

Carter: "A clean slate."

Methos: "Romans, you say? I have some experience with Romans."

### Beat 10: Joe Dawson

The Watcher enters. Joe Dawson - he's been documenting this from the Watcher side. He has records. Patterns of immortal deaths that didn't make sense. Watchers who disappeared.

"Whatever's coming, it knows about us. About the immortals. It's been... cleaning house."

The scope expands again. This isn't just human civilization at risk. The immortals are targets too. Something is being systematic.

### Beat 11: The Decommissioning

SGC. The gate room. This needs to be a *scene*.

The Stargate - the symbol of the franchise, the thing that saved Earth a dozen times - is being shut down.

Carter at the control room. Her hand on the console. The dialing computer spooling down.

"We can't trust the DHD software. We can't trust the diagnostic systems. We can't trust any of it. Until we can rebuild it clean, the gate is a liability."

The lights go dark. Covers placed over equipment. Military personnel filing out.

O'Neill is there (first appearance? or has he been present?). Watching his legacy go dark.

"Hell of a retirement party."

### Beat 12: The One Gate

One gate remains operational. The connection to Nova Roma.

Why? Because it was never integrated with Earth systems. It runs on Ancient technology that predates the compromise.

"It's been waiting for two thousand years. It can wait a little longer while we figure out what we're doing."

END ACT TWO

---

## ACT THREE: "Piscina"

*The pool. The foundation. The first step.*

### Beat 13: Arrival

The gate activates. SG-1, Duncan, and Methos step through onto Nova Roma.

First sight: Mediterranean landscape. Mountains. A Roman forum built around the Stargate - the Forum Stellarum. Citizens in togas watching with a mixture of awe and caution.

Pliny the Elder approaches. Two thousand years old. Immortal since Vesuvius. He's been *waiting*.

### Beat 14: Pliny

Pliny's story: died at Vesuvius, 79 AD. Woke in the ash. Found the gate while investigating phenomena. Has been in Nova Roma ever since, documenting everything.

"The gate activated once, long ago. Before I arrived. A message came through. In a language the colonists didn't recognize. But one word was clear: *praeparate*. Prepare."

Someone knew. Someone sent a warning. The colonists didn't understand it. Pliny has been trying to understand it for two millennia.

### Beat 15: Two Immortals

Methos and Pliny meet. Two ancient beings. Pliny is delighted.

"You remember the Republic? The real Republic, not the histories?"

Methos: "I remember it was messier than the histories."

Pliny: "Everything is messier than the histories. That's why I write everything down."

He shows them his life's work: *Naturalis Historia Nova*. One hundred and twelve volumes documenting everything about this world and its people.

### Beat 16: The Scope

Carter sees Nova Roma clearly now. Three thousand people. Roman technology level. Agriculture, crafts, republican governance.

They have everything they need to survive. What they don't have is any way to fight what's coming.

"We need to give them everything. Not just tools - understanding. They need to be able to build this themselves, maintain it after we're gone, improve it."

Daniel: "A curriculum. We're not just building software. We're building a school."

### Beat 17: The Foundation Question

MacLeod: "Where do you start? What's the most fundamental thing?"

Carter thinks. Really thinks.

"Memory. Before you can compute anything, you need somewhere to put it. Before you can build any structure, you need to allocate space for it. Memory management is the foundation everything else sits on."

### Beat 18: The Name

Daniel: "The Romans had public pools. *Piscinae*. For bathing, for fish, for training. A shared resource, managed communally."

Carter: "Arena allocation. You allocate from a pool. When you're done, you drain the whole pool at once. It's simpler than tracking individual allocations."

Pliny, listening: "*Piscina*. I like it. A word they already know, given new meaning. That's how languages grow."

### Beat 19: The Workshop

Pliny's villa, converted to a workspace. Oil lamps and laptop. Roman engineers and Earth scientists.

MARCUS AURELIUS FERRARIUS - the Roman engineer who will become the first native technical lead. He's skeptical but curious.

Carter starts explaining. Memory as water. The pool. Allocation as drawing from the pool. Reset as draining.

Marcus asks the question that proves he understands: "But in a real piscina, you cannot put the water back."

Carter: "That's exactly right. We're not returning the water. We're just... forgetting that we used it. The vessel remains. Only our accounting changes."

Marcus: "Ah."

That "ah" is the episode's climax. A Roman engineer understanding a computing concept through Roman metaphors.

### Beat 20: The First Code

Carter at the laptop. The structure taking shape:

```c
structura Piscina {
            Alveus* primus;
            Alveus* nunc;
    memoriae_index  mensura_alvei_initia;
         character* titulus;
               b32  est_dynamicum;
};
```

Daniel translating as she types. Pliny taking notes. Marcus watching, starting to see the shape of something new.

"Every pool has a name. For debugging. When something goes wrong, you need to know which pool it came from."

Daniel: "*Titulus*. The label. The inscription."

END ACT THREE

## TAG

### Beat 21: Dawn

The Forum Stellarum at dawn. Carter alone with the gate.

MacLeod finds her.

"You know what the hardest part is going to be? The patience. I've watched people build things. Churches that took three hundred years. Everyone wants to see the finished work. Almost no one wants to lay the foundation."

Carter: "We don't have three hundred years."

MacLeod: "No. But you have to work like you do. Rushed code is vulnerable code. Isn't that the whole point?"

### Beat 22: The Foundation

Carter looks at the gate. Silent now. Waiting.

Behind her, light in Pliny's villa. People working. The first code being written.

**CARTER:** *Piscina est fundamentum.*

She walks back toward the villa. Toward the work.

The gate stands silent. Two thousand light years away, a clock is ticking.

FADE TO BLACK.

## STINGER

### Beat 23: The First Arrival

**Location:** Earth. Somewhere remote. A field, a desert, a forest clearing - somewhere with no witnesses. Night.

Silence.

Then: a sound. Building. Electrical. Wrong.

Lightning begins to arc from nowhere - striking the ground, the air, itself. A sphere of energy forming. The Terminator arrival effect: displaced air, ozone, violence.

At the center of the sphere, a figure materializes. Crouched. The scorch mark spreading beneath him.

The energy dissipates. Smoke rises.

He stands. Slowly. Mechanically. Something is *wrong* with him.

We see him now: DATA. But not the Data we know.

He's battle-damaged. Badly. Synthetic skin torn, exposing circuitry beneath. One eye's covering is missing - the mechanical orb visible, unsettling. Scorch marks. Gashes. He's been through a war.

He moves stiffly. Jerkily. Damage affecting his motor control.

He looks around. No expression. No reaction. Just... processing.

Then his eyes glow. Green.

He stands motionless. Waiting. A broken machine with Borg eyes.

*The audience thinks: This is the threat.*

### Beat 24: The Second Arrival

Same location. Seconds later? Minutes? The timestream is unstable.

Another sphere of energy. Another violent arrival.

This figure lands differently. Not mechanical. *Human*.

He's gasping. Panting. The arrival hurt. He's disoriented, checking his body, making sure he's intact. Naked and vulnerable.

He looks around with urgency. Fear. The eyes of someone who's seen things. Who barely made it.

He sees Data standing there. His expression shifts - recognition? Wariness?

Then he looks past Data. At the world. At Earth.

He's arrived. He made it.

We see his face now. Young. Handsome. That jawline.

*Kirk.*

He's catching his breath. Steadying himself. The body language of a survivor. A man with a mission. A warning to deliver.

*The audience thinks: This is our hero.*

Beat.

DATA stands motionless, green-eyed, broken.

KIRK crouches, panting, human, desperate.

Two arrivals. Two time travelers.

The audience knows which one to trust.

They're wrong.

SMASH TO BLACK.

END OF EPISODE

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Jack O'Neill's role.** Is he present throughout? Does he arrive later? Is he the one who has to authorize the decommissioning?

2. **The mole in Act One.** Still needed? Or does the Borg reveal in the cold open do enough work? If we keep the mole, who are they?

3. **The warning message.** Who sent "*praeparate*" through the gate? When? This could be a season-long mystery. Connection to Borg?

4. **Midas.** Does he appear in the pilot or is he introduced later? He'd add comedy but might overcrowd the episode.

5. **Joe Dawson's role.** Does he come to Nova Roma or stay on Earth as liaison?

6. **This version of the Borg.** Green aesthetic. Technology golems. Partial assimilation that allows human appearance. How different from TNG Borg? What's the lore?

7. **The target's backstory.** How long has he been Borg? Was he assimilated on Earth or elsewhere? Is he a scout, a seed, something else?

8. **Duncan's investigation.** What led him to this same place? What does he know that SG-1 doesn't? How long has he been tracking this?

---

## THE BORG (This Version)

**Visual Identity:** Green, not the blue-black of TNG. The glow comes from *inside* - eyes, mouth, eventually spreading through the skin like circuitry becoming visible. Less "cybernetic zombie," more "possessed by technology."

**Assimilation Spectrum:** Not binary (human vs drone). There are stages:
- **Seeds:** Fully human-appearing. Nanoprobes dormant. Sleeper agents who may not know what they are.
- **Awakened:** Can interface with technology, form golems, but still pass as human most of the time.
- **Merged:** The golem state. Technology and flesh becoming one. Combat form.
- **Full Drone:** The classic Borg look. End stage. No return.

**The Infrastructure Play:** They don't invade with ships first. They spend decades compromising supply chains, inserting backdoors, creating dependencies. When the fleet arrives, they don't need to fight - they just *activate* what's already theirs.

**The Seeding:** Borg "tablets" - artifacts that look like ancient cuneiform but are actually dormant Borg technology - have been planted on Earth for centuries, maybe millennia. Alone, they're inert. But when they contact modern microchip technology (phone camera, computer, anything digital), they activate. Instant assimilation of whoever's holding the device. The Borg have been waiting for humanity to build the infrastructure that completes their weapon.

**Why Immortals Matter:** Immortal physiology rejects nanoprobes. The healing factor treats them as foreign bodies and expels them. Immortals cannot be assimilated. This makes them the only beings the Borg can't turn into weapons - and therefore targets for elimination.

**The Green:** Why green? TBD. Could be:
- A different Borg faction/evolution
- Earlier stage of Borg development (they become blue-black later?)
- Something unique to this infiltration methodology
- Just looks cool and distinguishes from TNG

---

## SEASON 1 BIG BAD: KIRK

**The Concept:** James T. Kirk - young, TOS Season 1 era - sent back in time like a Terminator. Originally on a mission to warn or prevent. He failed. He was assimilated. Now he's the Borg's primary agent on Earth.

**The T2 Misdirect:** The audience is fooled along with the characters.

In the 1x01 stinger:
- Data arrives first: damaged, mechanical, creepy, green-eyed. Reads as THREAT.
- Kirk arrives second: panting, vulnerable, human, desperate. Reads as HERO.

In 1x02 "Credo":
- Kirk integrates with the team. Helpful. Charming. Warns about "the android."
- Data is contained, studied. Can't or won't speak. Carter works on repairs.
- Slowly, things don't add up. Kirk knows too much. Data's damage pattern matches *fighting* Borg.
- The reversal: Kirk's eyes glow green. Data was the hero all along.

**Why It Works:**
- Kirk represents humanity's best: ingenuity, charm, refusal to accept no-win scenarios
- Seeing him *as* the enemy makes the Borg threat visceral in a way drones don't
- He's not a shambling zombie - he's *charming*. He builds networks. He makes friends. He smiles.
- He knows how heroes think. He used to be one.
- The audience feels clever for being fooled - the misdirect is *fair*

**The Tragedy:** The guy who beat the Kobayashi Maru lost this one. The man who talked computers into self-destruction became a computer's instrument. There may be something of Kirk still in there - or there may not. That ambiguity is the drama.

**Timeline:** He arrives at the end of 1x01, escapes/goes underground at the end of 1x02. Season 1 is him building his network, establishing cover, beginning the infrastructure compromise. Our heroes know he's out there now - but they can't find him.

**Open Questions:**
- Who sent them back? Future Starfleet? Section 31? The Borg themselves?
- When was Kirk assimilated? Before or after arrival? (Data would know)
- What was their original mission?
- Is there anything left of the real Kirk?
- What's Kirk's cover identity for the decades he'll be operating?
- Why does Data's eyes glow green in the stinger? (Needs a fair explanation)

---

## THEMATIC NOTES

**Capacitas Nova** = "New Capacity" - the pool growing to accommodate more. The show's universe expanding. The audience's understanding expanding. Humanity's capacity to survive expanding through backup civilization.

**The Pool Metaphor** - memory allocation as foundation for everything else. But also: pooling resources, pooling knowledge, pooling *three* franchises.

**The Decommissioning** - the old tools have to be put down before new ones can be trusted. Letting go of what saved you before because it can't save you now.

**Romans as Collaborators** - they're not blank slates receiving knowledge. Marcus's insight about "the vessel remains" is *better* than Carter's original explanation. The knowledge transfer goes both ways.

**Analog vs Digital** - The Borg are the ultimate digital threat: networked, upgradeable, turning technology against its users. The Immortals are the ultimate analog response: unkillable, unassimilable, carrying knowledge in their heads not their devices. The Romans are somewhere in between - pre-digital but about to receive an entire technological civilization compressed into years.

**"Borg" as a word** - It means nothing to the characters. It means everything to the audience. That dramatic irony carries the cold open.
