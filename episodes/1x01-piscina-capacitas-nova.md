# NOVUM FUNDAMENTUM
## Episode 1x01: "Piscina: Capacitas Nova"
### Beat Sheet (Draft 4)

---

## COLD OPEN

**Location:** Earth. Upscale private poker room - Monaco vibes. Crystal, dark wood, soft lighting. The kind of place where very serious people do very quiet business. Night.

**Setup:** SG-1 (Carter, Daniel, Teal'c) has been investigating why every Stargate on Earth went dark six months ago. No explanation. No attack. They just stopped working. Tonight they've tracked a lead - communications anomalies, unexplained deaths, technology behaving strangely - to a man at this table.

**The scene:** They're dressed up. Formal wear. Carter in evening dress, Daniel in a tailored suit, Teal'c imposing in black tie. They don't look like soldiers. They look like high-stakes players.

Texas hold 'em. But the real game is the conversation.

The TARGET sits across from them. Composed. Wealthy-looking. He's been playing this role for years - decades maybe. A man with connections, with access, with influence.

**The conversation:** Coded. Circling. They're feeling each other out through bets and small talk. But slowly, SG-1 closes the net. Carter mentions an operation. Daniel references a name. Teal'c says nothing but watches.

The target realizes, piece by piece, that they know. They know *what* he is, even if they don't know the word for it yet.

**The tell:** He laughs quietly. To himself. Resigned but almost amused.

**CARTER:** The only thing I haven't figured out is you. Who are you?

Beat. He sets down his cards.

**TARGET:** *(quiet, almost gentle)* Borg.

**The transformation:** His eyes begin to glow. Green. Not the blue-white of Goa'uld, not the gold of ascension. *Green*. Then his mouth. Light bleeding from inside him.

Everything electronic in the room - phones on the table, security cameras, the card shuffler, tablets, earpieces - starts to *move*. Metal and wire and glass pulling toward him, assembling around him. A technology golem forming from the detritus of modern life.

He's not controlling it remotely. He's *merged* with it. The sympathetic damage is visible - when they shoot the golem, he flinches. When they hit a critical mass of circuitry, he bleeds.

**The fight:** Brief and brutal. The golem attacks. SG-1 responds with gunfire. The golem staggers as the man staggers. They destroy enough of it that he collapses - man and machine together, the green light fading from his eyes.

He's dead. The golem is junk. Phones and tablets and wires scattered across the poker table like a losing hand.

**The aftermath:** Silence. Heavy breathing. They search the body. Find keys.

**DANIEL:** What did he say? "Borg?" What does that mean?

**CARTER:** I don't know.

They move to a door at the back of the room. His private office. The place they've been trying to get to for a year.

**The door:** They unlock it. Step through.

A man is already there, going through files. Calm. Professional. Like he belongs here more than they do.

He turns.

**CARTER:** Who are you?

**DUNCAN:** I'm Duncan MacLeod.

Said like it should mean something. It doesn't. To them.

SMASH TO MAIN TITLES

---

## ACT ONE: "Capacitas"

*The capacity to hold information. The audience's capacity expanding to hold two universes.*

### Beat 1: Standoff

Immediate tension. SG-1 has weapons on Duncan. He's not afraid. Professional respect between people who recognize competence.

Duncan: "You're SGC. Took you long enough."

He's been tracking them too. He knows who they are. They don't know what he is.

### Beat 2: The Exchange

Careful negotiation. Duncan offers information. He's been working this problem longer than they have. Decades, not months.

He starts explaining: the invasion isn't coming. It's already here. Infrastructure level. The advance work has been happening for thirty years. Backdoors in hardware. Compromised supply chains. Sleeper protocols in software that runs everything.

"Your gates going dark? That's not an attack. That's a side effect. Something's interfering with the physics. Something new. Something they built."

"In ten to twenty years, they arrive. And when they do, they press a button and every system you depend on turns against you. Power grids. Communications. Water treatment. The machines you've taught to run your civilization will be the weapons that end it."

### Beat 3: Skepticism

Daniel and Carter push back. This is conspiracy thinking. Where's the evidence?

Duncan: "Your informant. The one who just died. How long did you trust him?"

They're shaken. He was vetted. Years of service.

Duncan: "There are more. Everywhere. You've been compromised at every level. The question isn't who you can trust. The question is whether you can trust *anything with a microchip*."

### Beat 4: The Borg Files

Duncan gestures to what he's been examining. Strange artifacts on the desk. Tablet-like objects covered in markings that look almost like cuneiform - ancient, weathered, but somehow *wrong*. Too regular. Too precise.

Daniel is drawn to them. "These markings... they're not any language I recognize. But the structure..."

Duncan: "I've been tracking these for decades. They show up in strange places. Archaeological sites. Corporate vaults. Private collections. Always connected to the pattern I've been following."

Carter: "What are they?"

Duncan: "I was hoping you could tell me."

A REDSHIRT - junior SGC operative who came with them - moves closer. Pulls out his phone to photograph the tablets for analysis.

Duncan sees it too late: "Wait - don't -"

The phone's camera activates. The tablet *reacts*. The cuneiform markings begin to glow. Green.

The phone pulls toward the tablet. Or the tablet toward the phone. They *want* to connect.

Contact.

The redshirt's eyes flash green. Instant. No transition. One moment human, the next - not.

### Beat 5: Infection and Resurrection

The infected redshirt draws his weapon. Starts firing. Not randomly - *targeted*. He knows who the threats are.

Duncan moves without thinking. Puts himself between the gunfire and Carter. Takes multiple rounds to the chest.

He goes down hard.

Teal'c neutralizes the redshirt - staff weapon, brutal, efficient. The green light fades from the operative's eyes as he collapses.

Carter rushes to Duncan. Checks vitals. He's dead. Clearly dead. Multiple gunshot wounds.

**CARTER:** He's gone.

Daniel stares at the tablets. The glow has faded. They look inert again. Ancient. Harmless.

**DANIEL:** What the hell just happened?

Beat. Silence.

Duncan gasps. His eyes fly open.

He sits up, touching his chest. The wounds are closing. The bullets pushing out of his flesh.

**DUNCAN:** *(catching his breath)* That's going to be complicated to explain.

SG-1's worldview cracks open. Again. They've seen aliens, gods, ascended beings. But a human who doesn't die?

Daniel, fastest to connect: "The Watchers. The chronicles of immortals. I thought those were myths. Classified speculation."

Duncan: "Not myths. And there are others. Older than me. If we're going to survive what's coming, you need to meet them."

He looks at the tablets. At the dead redshirt.

Duncan: "And now you've seen how it spreads. Ancient technology meets modern. That's the trigger. That's how they've been seeding this planet for centuries. Waiting for you to build the infrastructure they need."

He pulls out a phone - old, analog, no camera.

Duncan: "I need to make a call. We know where these tablets are coming from. And tonight's the night we do something about it."

END ACT ONE

---

## ACT TWO: "Nova"

*New. The new plan. The new alliance. The new threat fully revealed.*

### Beat 6: Casey's Safehouse

**Location:** Remote. Off-grid. A farmhouse or compound that looks abandoned but isn't. No power lines running to it. No satellite dishes. Old trucks, not new cars.

Duncan brings SG-1 here. They're met by CASEY - weathered, ageless, cowboy energy even in modern clothes. And METHOS - sardonic, watching, assessing.

Casey: "So you're the SGC. Duncan's told me about you."

Carter: "And who are you?"

Casey: "Someone who's been watching your civilization build its own coffin for sixty years."

He leads them inside. The farmhouse is deceptive - underground levels, clean rooms, hardware that looks like it's from the 80s and 90s. Deliberate.

Casey: "No chips manufactured after 1985. Nothing networked. Nothing they can touch."

### Beat 7: The Pattern

Casey's war room. Maps on the walls - physical maps, pins and string. Photographs. Documents. A conspiracy theorist's lair, except it's all real.

Casey explains: He and Duncan have been tracking this for decades. The tablets. The disappearances. The technology that behaves wrong. Strange readings. Interference patterns. It all traces back to one location.

An old Spanish mission. American Southwest - New Mexico, maybe Arizona. Abandoned since the 1800s. The padres built around something they didn't understand.

Casey: "I've known about it since 1858. Strange things happened there. Objects aging wrong. Compasses spinning. Time felt *different* near it. The padres thought it was holy. Then they thought it was cursed. They left. Nobody's been back since."

Carter: "And you think this is what's interfering with our gates?"

Casey: "Six months ago, the readings from that location spiked. Same time your gates went dark. That's not a coincidence."

Carter: "What's in there?"

Casey: "We don't know. Every drone we've sent in stopped transmitting. Every team we've considered sending... we didn't have enough people we could trust. Until now."

### Beat 8: The Impossible Choice

Carter processes. Whatever's in that mission shut down the entire gate network.

Carter: "We have to take it. If there's any chance of getting our gates back online..."

Casey: "That's the idea. But there's more."

He shows them intercepted signals. Partial translations Daniel works through in real-time. Signals coming *from* the mission.

Daniel: "*Praeparate*... prepare. *Colonia*... colony. These are old. Latin. But the transmission method is..."

Carter: "Not ancient."

Casey: "Someone's communicating through that location. Has been for years. We just didn't know what we were looking at until your gates went down and the pattern became clear."

The stakes crystallize. Whatever's in that mission isn't just interfering with Earth's gates. It's connected to something else. Somewhere else.

### Beat 9: The Assault Plan

Casey has been preparing for this. Weapons - old ones, mechanical, nothing digital. Vehicles. A team.

O'Neill appears - first time we see him. He's been here. Part of this operation all along, working off-book.

O'Neill: "So we're really doing this. Attacking a Spanish mission."

Duncan: "A Borg-controlled Spanish mission."

O'Neill: "Right. Evil mission. Much better."

The team: Carter, Daniel, Teal'c, O'Neill, Duncan, Casey, Methos. Seven people against whatever's been killing their drones.

Casey: "We get in. We find whatever's generating the interference. We shut it down or we take it. Either way, we finally get some answers."

### Beat 10: The Mission Assault

**Location:** The Spanish mission. Adobe walls. Bell tower. Courtyard with a dry fountain. Beautiful and wrong. Too quiet. No birds. No insects. The desert around it feels *dead*. Technology doesn't work right near it - compasses spin, phones die.

The assault is tactical, brutal, strange. The defenders aren't human - they're machines. Humanoid robots, crude but effective, being remote-controlled by the Borg from somewhere else. Green lights where eyes should be. They move wrong, react wrong. No self-preservation. No fear.

Casey: "They're not people. Don't hesitate."

The Immortals can't be killed - they take point, absorbing damage that would kill anyone else. Casey with a lever-action rifle (he's had this gun for a hundred years), Duncan with a sword, Methos hanging back but deadly when needed.

Teal'c and O'Neill provide military precision. Carter and Daniel work toward the center of the complex, following the readings, looking for whatever's generating the interference.

### Beat 11: The Gate Room

They breach the central chamber expecting machinery, a transmitter, something technological.

They find a Stargate.

**CARTER:** That's... that's not possible.

It's active. The event horizon shimmers. A permanent connection to somewhere. It's been running this whole time.

Borg tech surrounds it. The tablets stacked like offerings. A control system that's half-ancient, half-alien.

One final defender - a larger robot, more sophisticated than the others. The fight is desperate.

They win. Barely. The machine falls.

Carter examines the control system. Her hands are shaking.

**CARTER:** This is what's been interfering with our gates. It's... it's a different kind of gate. The physics are wrong. It's not just connecting to another place, it's...

**DANIEL:** It's what?

**CARTER:** I don't know. But it's been running for a long time. Permanently open. One address.

She looks at the shimmering event horizon.

**DANIEL:** Where does it go?

**CARTER:** Only one way to find out.

END ACT TWO

---

## ACT THREE: "Piscina"

*The pool. The foundation. The first step.*

### Beat 12: Through the Gate

They step through.

First sight: Mediterranean landscape. Mountains. Blue sky. A Roman forum built around the gate arrival point - the Forum Stellarum.

But they don't emerge to an empty plaza.

They emerge to armed Romans. Spears. Shields. Military discipline.

And in front of them, relaxed, amused: MIDAS.

**MIDAS:** Finally! Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting?

Duncan and Methos sense it immediately. The Immortal buzz.

**DUNCAN:** There's one of us here.

**MIDAS:** One of you? I've been here for eighty years. Well - eighty years for me. I'm told it's been longer on your end.

### Beat 13: The Reunion

The Romans stand down at Midas's signal. He knows these people - or people like them. He's been waiting.

Midas explains, in his rambling way: He came through the gate with the original exiles. Rome used the portal to dispose of inconvenient people - criminals, political enemies, anyone they wanted gone. "I was one of the political enemies. Long story. Involves a misunderstanding about taxation."

He leads them into the forum. Nova Roma spreads out around them - a small but complete civilization. Roman architecture. Roman dress. Roman *life*.

**MIDAS:** They thought I was a god at first. I told them I wasn't. They didn't believe me. Then I died in front of them and came back, and they *really* didn't believe me. Took about twenty years to sort out.

### Beat 14: Pliny

They're brought to a villa. Larger than the others. A scholar's home.

PLINY emerges. An exile like Midas, but mortal - one of the original colonists, now old. Eighty years of building a civilization in a strange land. Methos recognizes the look of someone who's seen too much and written it all down anyway.

**PLINY:** More visitors from Earth. And Immortals among you. Midas said you might come eventually.

**CARTER:** You knew about us?

**PLINY:** I knew about the gate. I knew time moved strangely here - our eighty years, your two thousand. I've spent my life trying to understand why.

He leads them inside. Shows them a stone tablet - old, preserved carefully.

**PLINY:** *Praeparate*. It came through the gate before we did. The first exiles found it waiting. I've spent eighty years trying to understand what it means.

**DANIEL:** "Prepare." We found the same word in intercepted communications. From something called... Borg.

**PLINY:** Borg. Is that what built the gate? Is that what brought us here?

**METHOS:** We're still figuring that out.

Pliny considers this. A lifetime of questions, and now strangers with pieces of the answer.

**PLINY:** Then we have much to discuss.

### Beat 15: The Scope

Pliny's villa. Maps of Nova Roma. Census records. The *Naturalis Historia Nova* - forty volumes and counting. A life's work.

The colony: three thousand people. Started with perhaps two hundred exiles eighty years ago. Roman technology level. Agriculture, crafts, republican governance. Isolated. Clean. Untouched by anything the Borg have done to Earth.

Midas: "Three generations now. The grandchildren of the original exiles. They're good people. Stubborn. Opinionated. Very Roman about everything. But good."

Carter sees it now. This isn't just a colony to save. It's a *platform*. A place to build something new.

**CARTER:** They're completely clean. No compromised technology. No corrupted infrastructure. We could...

**DANIEL:** Build from scratch. Everything we can't trust on Earth.

**CASEY:** That's the idea.

Everyone turns. Casey has been quiet, looking around, assessing.

**CASEY:** I've been trying to build clean systems for thirty years. But you can't do it on Earth. Not really. The contamination is too deep. But here...

He looks at Pliny's scrolls. At the Roman engineers examining their strange visitors.

**CASEY:** Here we could do it right.

### Beat 16: The Foundation Question

They're in Pliny's workshop now. Oil lamps. Wax tablets. A Roman scriptorium about to become something else.

MARCUS AURELIUS FERRARIUS - Roman engineer, skeptical, curious - has been listening to everything.

**MARCUS:** You speak of building. Of systems we don't understand. Where do you begin?

Carter thinks. This is the question.

**CARTER:** Memory. Before you can compute anything, you need somewhere to put it. Before you can build any structure, you need to allocate space for it.

**DANIEL:** The Romans had public pools. *Piscinae*. For bathing, for training. A shared resource.

**CARTER:** Arena allocation. You allocate from a pool. When you're done with a task, you drain the whole pool at once. It's simpler than tracking individual pieces.

Marcus frowns. Thinking.

**MARCUS:** But in a real piscina, you cannot put the water back. Once drawn, it is used.

**CARTER:** That's exactly right. We're not returning the water. We're just... forgetting that we used it. The vessel remains. Only our accounting changes.

Beat.

**MARCUS:** Ah.

That "ah" is the episode's climax. A Roman engineer understanding a computing concept through Roman metaphors.

**PLINY:** *Piscina*. A word they know, given new meaning. That's how languages grow.

### Beat 17: The First Code

Carter pulls out her laptop - old, air-gapped, one of Casey's clean machines.

The structure takes shape on screen:

```c
structura Piscina {
            Alveus* primus;
            Alveus* nunc;
    memoriae_index  mensura_alvei_initia;
         character* titulus;
               b32  est_dynamicum;
};
```

Daniel translating as she types. Pliny taking notes. Midas offering unhelpful suggestions. Marcus watching, starting to see the shape of something new.

**CARTER:** Every pool has a name. For debugging. When something goes wrong, you need to know which pool it came from.

**DANIEL:** *Titulus*. The label. The inscription.

**MARCUS:** And *alveus*? I know this word. A basin. A trough.

**CARTER:** The pool is made of basins. When one fills, we create another. They link together.

**MARCUS:** Like chambers in a hypocaust. The heat flows from one to the next.

**CARTER:** *(to Daniel, impressed)* He's going to be better at this than us.

END ACT THREE

---

## TAG

### Beat 18: Dawn

The Forum Stellarum at dawn. Carter alone with the gate.

Casey finds her.

**CASEY:** Can't sleep?

**CARTER:** We just took on a mission that might take decades. We're trying to rebuild all of human knowledge for a civilization that's never seen a computer. And somewhere out there, a clock is ticking.

**CASEY:** I've been working on this for thirty years. Alone, mostly. Building pieces I knew would never fit together in my lifetime.

He looks at the forum. At Nova Roma waking up.

**CASEY:** This is the first time I've thought we might actually pull it off.

**CARTER:** Why?

**CASEY:** Because it's not just me anymore. And because they're not starting from where we started. They're not going to make our mistakes. No npm. No blockchain. No fourteen million dependencies. They're going to learn it *right*.

### Beat 19: The Foundation

Behind them, light in Pliny's villa. People working. The first code being written.

**CARTER:** *Piscina est fundamentum.*

**CASEY:** That's the idea.

She walks back toward the villa. Toward the work.

Casey stays a moment longer. Looking at the gate. At the sky.

Somewhere, the Borg are still coming. But here, something new is beginning.

FADE TO BLACK.

## STINGER

### Beat 20: The First Arrival

**Location:** Earth. Yellowstone. Night. Steam rises from hot springs. The landscape is alien, primordial - mineral deposits in strange colors, the ground itself seeming to breathe.

Silence except for the hiss of geothermal vents.

Then: a sound. Building. Electrical. Wrong.

Lightning begins to arc from nowhere - striking the ground, the air, itself. A sphere of energy forming. The Terminator arrival effect: displaced air, ozone, violence. Steam billows outward.

At the center of the sphere, a figure materializes. Crouched. The scorch mark spreading beneath him, minerals cracking from the heat.

The energy dissipates. Smoke and steam mix.

He stands. Slowly. Mechanically. Something is *wrong* with him.

We see him now: DATA. But not the Data we know.

He's battle-damaged. Badly. Synthetic skin torn, exposing circuitry beneath. One eye's covering is missing - the mechanical orb visible, unsettling. Scorch marks. Gashes. He's been through a war.

He moves stiffly. Jerkily. Damage affecting his motor control.

He looks around at the hellish landscape. No expression. No reaction. Just... processing.

Then his eyes glow. Green. Matching the strange colors of the hot springs.

He stands motionless among the steam vents. Waiting. A broken machine with Borg eyes in a landscape that looks like another planet.

*The audience thinks: This is the threat.*

### Beat 21: The Second Arrival

**Location:** Northern California. Redwood forest. Night. Ancient trees, cathedral silence. Fog drifting between trunks that have stood for a thousand years.

A different kind of primordial.

Then: the same sound. Building. Electrical. Wrong.

Lightning arcs between the massive trunks. A sphere of energy forming. Birds scatter. The forest that has seen everything hasn't seen this.

At the center, a figure materializes. The scorch mark spreads across the forest floor, ferns burning.

This figure lands differently. Not mechanical. *Human*.

He's gasping. Panting. The arrival hurt. He's disoriented, checking his body, making sure he's intact. Naked and vulnerable among the ancient trees.

He looks around with urgency. Fear. The eyes of someone who's seen things. Who barely made it.

The fog swirls around him. He's alone. No idea where Data landed, or if Data made it at all.

He steadies himself against a redwood trunk. Catches his breath. Looks up at the trees towering above him.

He's arrived. He made it.

We see his face now. Young. Handsome. That jawline.

*Kirk.*

He's catching his breath. Steadying himself. The body language of a survivor. A man with a mission. A warning to deliver.

*The audience thinks: This is our hero.*

SMASH TO BLACK.

END OF EPISODE

---

## NOTES FOR 1x02: "Credo"

**Hour two picks up with:**
- Kirk and Data on Earth - Kirk finds the team (now at the mission), integrates, is helpful and charming
- Data contained, studied - Carter works on repairs, notices damage patterns match *fighting* Borg
- Work continues on Nova Roma - first tests of Piscina, the Credo testing framework introduced
- The reversal - Kirk exposed, his eyes glow green, Data was trying to warn them all along
- Kirk escapes into the world, Data joins the team
- Thematic parallel: Credo means "I believe/trust" but the framework is about *verification*. The whole episode asks: how do you test who to trust?

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. ~~**The mission location.**~~ Resolved: American Southwest Spanish mission, abandoned since the 1800s.

2. **The praeparate message.** Was it a warning from allies, or intercepted Borg communication? Who sent it?

3. **Joe Dawson.** Does he appear in hour one or is he introduced in hour two?

4. **The Ra connection.** When does this get revealed? Hour two? Later in season one?

5. **Midas's backstory.** How exactly did he end up in Nova Roma? What's the comedy of errors?

6. **Data's green eyes.** The explanation - carrying Borg code as evidence? Damage? Needs to feel fair when revealed.

---

## THEMATIC NOTES

**Capacitas Nova** = "New Capacity" - the pool growing to accommodate more. The show's universe expanding. The audience's understanding expanding. Humanity's capacity to survive expanding through backup civilization.

**The Pool Metaphor** - memory allocation as foundation for everything else. But also: pooling resources, pooling knowledge, pooling four franchises.

**The Mission** - padres preserving faith and knowledge on the frontier through centuries of change. The aesthetic carries through to Nova Roma - ancient architecture, careful scholarship, patience. Casey's connection to it since 1858 ties the American West to the grander historical sweep.

**Romans as Collaborators** - Marcus's "ah" and his hypocaust comparison. He's not just receiving knowledge, he's translating it into Roman concepts. The knowledge transfer goes both ways.

**Casey's Redemption** - thirty years of lonely work finally meaning something. "This is the first time I've thought we might actually pull it off."
