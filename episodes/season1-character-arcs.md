## THE CORE FOUR (SG-1)

### Colonel Samantha Carter
**Arc: Military Efficiency → Civilizational Thinking**
- **Start:** Carter approaches Nova Roma like a military deployment. Timelines, deliverables, operational security. She's brilliant but thinking in quarters, not centuries.
- **Turning Point 1 (early, ~1x04-05):** Marcus asks her a question she can't answer — not because she doesn't know the technical answer, but because the answer requires understanding *why* a civilization would want something. She realizes she's been building tools without understanding the culture they serve.
- **Turning Point 2 (mid-season, ~1x10-12):** Time dilation cost becomes personal. She realizes she's aging faster (Earth-side) than the project needs her. The work has to outlast her. She starts designing systems that can be maintained without her.
- **Turning Point 3 (late, ~1x18-20):** She defers a design decision to Marcus. Not because she can't decide, but because he'll be maintaining it for decades. The student's judgment matters more than the teacher's.
- **End:** Carter is thinking in generations. She's become what Casey has been for 30 years — someone building for a future she may not see.
- **Key Relationship: Carter/Casey** — Starts as mutual respect between professionals. Becomes genuine philosophical partnership. Casey teaches her to think long; she teaches him to work with a team again.
- **Key Relationship: Carter/Marcus** — Teacher/student that inverts. By season end, Marcus is correcting her assumptions.

### Dr. Daniel Jackson
**Arc: Translator → Language Architect**
- **Start:** Daniel approaches Latin as a translation problem. Convert English computing concepts into Latin. He's good at this. He's always been good at this.
- **Turning Point 1 (~1x03-04):** Lucia Serena tells him his translations are grammatically correct and conceptually wrong. "You are putting your thoughts in our words. That is not language. That is costume." He realizes he's been colonizing Latin instead of building with it.
- **Turning Point 2 (~1x08-10):** He coins a term that the Romans adopt naturally — it enters their daily vocabulary. The first time a piece of technical Latin *lives*. He understands the difference between translation and linguistic creation.
- **Turning Point 3 (~1x16-18):** A Roman student uses a term Daniel invented in a way Daniel didn't anticipate — extending the metaphor, creating new meaning. The language is growing beyond him. This is the point.
- **End:** Daniel is no longer translating. He's midwifing a new technical language that belongs to the Romans, not to Earth.
- **Key Relationship: Daniel/Lucia** — Intellectual equals who approach the same problem from opposite sides. She has the native intuition; he has the cross-cultural perspective. Romantic tension they're both too professional to acknowledge. By season end it's unspoken but undeniable.
- **Key Relationship: Daniel/Pliny** — Scholar to scholar across 2000 years. Pliny's Naturalis Historia Nova becomes the template for documentation philosophy.

### Colonel Jack O'Neill
**Arc: Retired Skeptic → Guardian of Common Sense**
- **Start:** O'Neill is here because he was asked, not because he believes in the mission. He's retired. He's seen too much. He thinks rebuilding civilization through C89 code is insane.
- **Turning Point 1 (~1x03):** He catches a bug in code review. He claims it was luck. Carter knows it wasn't. He's paying more attention than he pretends.
- **Turning Point 2 (~1x09-10):** A Roman citizen struggles with something the team built. O'Neill, not any of the technical people, identifies why — because he thinks like a user, not a developer. "If I can't understand it, they can't either."
- **Turning Point 3 (~1x17-19):** Kirk's network is closing in. O'Neill shifts from technical skeptic to strategic defender. He's the one who sees the operational picture. This is what he's actually for.
- **End:** O'Neill is fully committed but still pretends he isn't. His role is clear: he's the user advocate, the bullshit detector, and the tactical brain. He still claims he can't read code. He still catches bugs.
- **Key Relationship: O'Neill/Midas** — Comedy gold. Two people who process the world through irreverence. Midas tells stories about Aristotle; O'Neill tells stories about fishing. They understand each other perfectly.
- **Running Gag:** O'Neill gives Roman food increasingly specific reviews. By season end he's a respected food critic in Nova Roma and doesn't know how it happened.

### Teal'c
**Arc: Warrior → Quality Engineer**
- **Start:** Teal'c approaches testing as a warrior approaches training — total discipline, no shortcuts, find every weakness before the enemy does.
- **Turning Point 1 (~1x05-06):** He writes a test that fails in a way nobody expected. The failure reveals a design assumption nobody questioned. Teal'c: "A test that only confirms what you believe is not a test."
- **Turning Point 2 (~1x12-13):** He begins training Romans in testing methodology. His teaching style is Jaffa: rigorous, patient, expecting mastery. The Romans respond well — it's compatible with their military discipline.
- **Turning Point 3 (~1x20-21):** A Roman tester finds a critical flaw that Teal'c missed. Instead of shame, he shows visible pride. "You have exceeded your teacher."
- **End:** Teal'c has built a culture of testing in Nova Roma. His legacy isn't code — it's discipline.
- **Key Relationship: Teal'c/Marcus** — Warrior to engineer. They share a belief in rigor. Some of the show's best quiet scenes are these two, working side by side, saying almost nothing.
- **Signature line evolution:** "Indeed" shifts meaning throughout the season. Early: confirmation. Mid-season: respect. Late season: a Roman tester says it to Teal'c, and he almost smiles.

## THE IMMORTALS

### Duncan MacLeod
**Arc: Investigator → Builder**
- **Start:** Duncan has been tracking the Borg for decades. He's in intelligence mode — find the threat, neutralize it. He's good at this. Four centuries of survival instincts.
- **Turning Point 1 (~1x04-05):** On Nova Roma, he watches Casey and Carter building something. He realizes he's been fighting things his whole life but rarely building them. The frontier isn't a battlefield — it's a construction site.
- **Turning Point 2 (~1x10-11):** FLASHBACK SPOTLIGHT EPISODE. Renaissance Florence. Duncan watched Brunelleschi build the Duomo — an impossible project that took decades and outlived its creator. He begins to see Nova Roma as the same kind of audacious, generational work.
- **Turning Point 3 (~1x18-19):** Kirk's network threatens the mission directly. Duncan has to choose: go hunt Kirk (his instinct) or stay and protect the building (the need). He stays. First time he's chosen defense over offense.
- **End:** Duncan has found something he hasn't had in centuries — a project worth dedicating decades to. He's not just investigating the threat; he's investing in the solution.
- **Key Relationship: Duncan/Casey** — The anchor relationship of the Immortal cast. Decades of partnership. Duncan is the idealist; Casey is the pragmatist. They argue like an old married couple about architecture decisions.
- **Key Relationship: Duncan/Carter** — Mutual respect between two different kinds of competence.

### Methos
**Arc: Detached Observer → Reluctant Participant**
- **Start:** Methos is here because Duncan asked. He's 5000 years old. He's seen civilizations rise and fall dozens of times. He doesn't expect this one to be different. His default is sardonic detachment.
- **Turning Point 1 (~1x06-07):** He accidentally says something about the fall of Alexandria that makes Daniel stop dead. Methos has been treating his memory as a burden. Daniel treats it as treasure. "You were THERE?"
- **Turning Point 2 (~1x12-14):** FLASHBACK SPOTLIGHT EPISODE. The fall of classical civilization. Methos watched a library burn (not the famous one — a different one, worse). He watched knowledge die because nobody built systems to preserve it. Nova Roma's documentation project touches a nerve he thought was dead.
- **Turning Point 3 (~1x19-20):** In a crisis moment, Methos takes charge. Not because he wants to, but because he's the only one who's seen this pattern before.
- **End:** Methos is still sardonic. Still claims he doesn't care. But he's writing things down. He's contributing to Pliny's documentation. He's participating.
- **Key Relationship: Methos/Pliny** — Two old men, one immortal, one mortal, both carrying the weight of knowledge. They become friends quietly, over wine and manuscripts.
- **Key Relationship: Methos/Daniel** — Daniel is the only person who treats Methos's memory as a primary source rather than a burden.

### Midas
**Arc: Comic Relief → Tragic Hero (Who Doesn't Know It Yet)**
- **Start:** Midas is the life of the party. 3000 years old, endlessly enthusiastic, full of stories. The POV character for flashbacks to the ancient world.
- **Turning Point 1 (~1x05-06):** Small moment — a compass spinning near him. A clock running slow. Carter notices but doesn't connect it yet.
- **Turning Point 2 (~1x11-13):** More anomalies. Carter begins to suspect the temporal dilation is connected to a person, not a place. She starts running tests. Midas is cheerfully cooperative, oblivious.
- **Turning Point 3 (~1x20-22):** The truth is NOT revealed this season. But the audience knows. The pieces are there. Carter has a folder she hasn't opened. Season 2's biggest bomb.
- **End:** Midas is still joyful, generous, the heart of Nova Roma. The audience knows he's a ticking time bomb. He doesn't.
- **CRUCIAL:** The audience must love Midas so deeply that the eventual revelation is devastating. Season 1 is about building that love.
- **Key Relationship: Midas/Everyone** — He's the social glue. He knows every Roman by name.
- **Key Relationship: Midas/O'Neill** — The comedy double act.
- **Key Relationship: Data/Midas** — The most unexpected friendship. Both more important than anyone realizes.

### Casey
**Arc: Hermit → Team Member**
- **Start:** Casey has been alone for thirty years. Building clean systems by himself. Brilliant, disciplined, and isolated.
- **Turning Point 1 (~1x03-04):** FLASHBACK SPOTLIGHT EPISODE. The Web3 startup, the npm dependency tree, "That's when I knew it was over." His isolation was a choice, but it was also a wound.
- **Turning Point 2 (~1x08-09):** Someone improves on one of his designs. His first instinct is to reject it. He catches himself. "Huh. That's better."
- **Turning Point 3 (~1x15-16):** Casey teaches his first class in Nova Roma. He's terrible at teaching. Then he gets better. He discovers he likes it.
- **Turning Point 4 (~1x21-22):** Casey deploys something collaboratively. "This is what I was trying to build alone for thirty years. Turns out you need people."
- **End:** Casey has found community after a century of drifting. The loner cowboy has a town.
- **Key Relationship: Casey/Carter** — THE central technical partnership of the show.
- **Key Relationship: Casey/Duncan** — Old friends, different centuries of perspective.

### Joe Dawson
**Arc: Watcher → Chronicler of a New Age**
- **Start:** Joe is the Watcher. He documents Immortals. Here for the record.
- **Turning Point 1 (~1x06-07):** He meets Pliny and recognizes a kindred spirit — documentarians.
- **Turning Point 2 (~1x13-14):** Joe starts a bar in Nova Roma. The social hub. His natural habitat.
- **Turning Point 3 (~1x19-20):** Joe's records save the day — he documented something nobody else thought to record.
- **End:** Joe is writing the definitive chronicle. He's become the Josephus of Nova Roma.
- **Key Relationship: Joe/Pliny** — The friendship of the season. Two mortals among immortals.

## STAR TREK CHARACTERS

### Data
**Arc: Threat → Mystery → Team Member**
- **1x01 Stinger:** Arrives damaged, green-eyed. Audience thinks he's the villain.
- **1x02:** Contained, studied. The reversal — Kirk is the threat, Data is the warning.
- **Mid-season:** Slow integration. Romans fear him. Wins trust through actions.
- **Late season:** Questions about consciousness parallel the Romans' experience of new thinking.
- **End:** Trusted but not fully understood. Carries knowledge of a future where humanity lost.
- **Key Relationship: Data/Midas** — Unexpected friendship. Both more important than anyone realizes.

### Kirk (Assimilated)
**Arc: Hidden Threat → Revealed Enemy → Shadow Antagonist**
- **1x01-02:** The T2 misdirect. Audience thinks he's the hero.
- **1x02:** Exposed. Escapes.
- **1x03-22:** Off-screen but never absent. Reports, sightings, his network growing.
- **Tragic dimension:** The real Kirk might still exist inside. Data believes so. Season 2-3 thread.

## NOVA ROMA CHARACTERS

### Pliny
**Arc: Isolated Scholar → Connected Mentor**
- Eighty years of questions finally meeting answers. Energized by the Earth team. The project's institutional memory. Mortal and old — the clock is real for him.

### Marcus Aurelius Ferrarius
**Arc: Skeptic → Native Tech Lead**
- Skeptical of strangers. Roman engineering intuition proves valuable. First Roman to design independently. Running thread: "Why must we do it this way?"

### Lucia Serena
**Arc: Philosopher → Curriculum Architect**
- Distrustful of haste. Works with Daniel on pedagogy. Designs the educational system for the next generation.

### Gaius Tertius
