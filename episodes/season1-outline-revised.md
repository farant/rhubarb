# NOVUM FUNDAMENTUM
## Season 1: "Fundamentum" — REVISED Season Outline (New Threads Integrated)

### New Threads Added

This revision preserves all existing A-plots, episode structures, and serialized beats. The following new threads are woven into the existing fabric:

1. **Casey's Catholic Faith** — Visual, background element in every episode. The Nightcrawler approach.
2. **Gilfoyle & Dinesh** — Introduced mid-season (~1x10), established by 1x12, with a strong late-season hook.
3. **Historical Flashback B-Plots** — Enhanced with the nominalism thesis. Each flashback era matched to A-plot themes.
4. **Danny's Podcast** — Late-season seed. A voice, a mention, a thread for the audience to pull.
5. **The Black Stone of Cybele** — Mythology seed tied to Midas's Phrygian origins and the Ra connection.

### New Serialized Thread Tracking

**Thread 5: Casey's Faith (Background, Every Episode)**

| Episode | Faith Beat |
|---------|-----------|
| 1x01 | Casey crosses himself before entering the mission. Brief. No dialogue. First visual. |
| 1x02 | Casey's workbench has a small crucifix mounted on the wall. Camera lingers for one beat. |
| 1x03-04 | Casey's rosary visible when he reaches into a pocket. A Roman notices but says nothing. |
| 1x05-06 | Pliny asks Casey about the crucifix: "What does this image represent?" Casey: "A man who died for everyone." Pliny: "Willingly?" Casey: "Yes." Pliny writes something down. |
| 1x07-08 | Casey says grace quietly before a meal at Pliny's villa. O'Neill notices. Says nothing. It's not weird — it's just Casey. |
| 1x09-10 | A Roman asks about the rosary beads. Casey: "It's a prayer. You count." Roman: "How many prayers?" Casey: "Enough." |
| 1x11-12 | Under crisis pressure, Casey crosses himself before a critical deployment. Marcus sees it. After the crisis: "Your gesture — before battle?" Casey: "Before everything." |
| 1x13 | At Joe's bar opening, Casey hangs a small cross behind the bar with Joe's permission. Joe: "My bar's had worse decorations." |
| 1x14-16 | Pliny brings Casey a list of questions about his faith — written out, numbered, organized. A polymath's interview. Casey looks at the list: "This is going to take more than one evening." Pliny: "I have been waiting eighty years for interesting answers. I can wait a few more evenings." |
| 1x17 | Methos sees Casey praying. Says nothing. Later, to Duncan: "Your cowboy prays." Duncan: "He always has." Methos: "Hmm." (It's the 'hmm' of a 5000-year-old who has seen every religion but hasn't dismissed this one.) |
| 1x18 | During the lockdown, Casey prays the rosary openly. The team is too stressed to comment. A Roman woman asks Lucia about it later. Lucia: "He speaks to his god." Roman: "Does his god answer?" Lucia: "He seems to think so." |
| 1x19-22 | Background continuation. Casey's faith is simply part of the visual fabric of the show. By finale, the audience has absorbed it the way they absorbed Nightcrawler's — it's just who he is. |

**Thread 6: Gilfoyle & Dinesh (Mid-Season Introduction)**

| Episode | Gilfoyle/Dinesh Beat |
|---------|---------------------|
| 1x10 | INTRODUCTION. Earth-side C-plot. O'Neill, investigating Kirk's tech acquisitions, flags a company that HASN'T been acquired: an AI coding firm run by two guys who never attend industry events. "Every other company in their sector got bought or went weird. These two just... didn't." Scene at G&D's office: Gilfoyle deleting another mysterious investor email. Dinesh: "Shouldn't we at least read those?" Gilfoyle: "No." |
| 1x11-12 | During the mid-season crisis, O'Neill reaches out to G&D's company as a potential secure communications relay (since they're uncompromised). Gilfoyle refuses. "We don't do government contracts." Meanwhile, Gilfoyle notices that every CEO who attended a particular Napa retreat last quarter is now using identical phrasing in their earnings calls. |
| 1x14 | Brief Earth-side scene. Dinesh mentions a new podcast friend — "this guy Danny, he's really into The X-Files." Gilfoyle: "Everyone who's into The X-Files is a waste of your time." Dinesh: "He's fun! He has a podcast. He's doing a series on weird patterns in the tech industry." Gilfoyle pauses. "...What kind of patterns?" |
| 1x16-17 | Gilfoyle and Dinesh accidentally no-show a "visionary leadership summit" because Gilfoyle's home server crashed. The next week, three founders who DID attend have all pivoted their companies to "unified vision" platforms. |
| 1x18 | During the TLS crisis, O'Neill contacts G&D again. This time Gilfoyle listens longer. "You're saying the chips are compromised." O'Neill: "I'm saying be careful what hardware you trust." Gilfoyle, after hanging up: "We need to audit our supply chain." |
| 1x20 | MID-SEASON HOOK PAYOFF. Gilfoyle has the electron microscope results. Structures in the silicon that shouldn't be there. Not software. Physical structures in the transistors. "Every chip. Every foundry. Dinesh — it's all of them." The audience now knows G&D have independently discovered the ASML compromise. |
| 1x22 | Post-credits. The chip images pinned to a wall. Dinesh: "So what do we do?" Gilfoyle: "That military guy who called us? He knew. He already knew." Pause. "Yeah. We should call him back." Season 2 thread locked in. |

**Thread 7: Historical Flashback Enhancement (Nominalism Thesis)**

See per-episode notes below. Each flashback is enhanced to connect to the nominalism thesis where applicable.

**Thread 8: Danny's Podcast (Late Season Seed)**

| Episode | Danny Beat |
|---------|-----------|
| 1x14 | Dinesh mentions "this guy Danny" and his podcast. (See Thread 6.) |
| 1x18 | During the lockdown, someone's phone plays a podcast in the background — a British voice talking about "patterns, right, because it's like — have you ever noticed how EVERY weird thing in a small town follows the same playbook?" Background audio. Nobody reacts. The audience files it. |
| 1x20 | Dinesh, panicking about the chip discovery, calls Danny. "I need to talk to someone who won't think I'm crazy." Danny: "Mate, I'm the EXACT person for that. Go on." We hear Danny's voice but don't see his face. |

**Thread 9: The Black Stone of Cybele (Mythology Seed)**

| Episode | Cybele Beat |
|---------|------------|
| 1x05 | When the compass spins near Midas, Methos reacts in the background — barely perceptible. He's seen temporal artifacts before. |
| 1x13 | MIDAS FLASHBACK: Enhanced. The Phrygian temporal artifact is a stone — black, dense, warm. Midas: "The priests said it fell from the sky. They called it the Mother's gift." Cybele cult imagery visible. |
| 1x17 | METHOS FLASHBACK: Enhanced. The lost library contains "a stone, black as night, that the priests guarded. They said it spoke to them." Daniel: "Spoke how?" Methos: "They heard... instructions. Whispered. They thought it was a goddess." Two stones, one thread. |

### REVISED Episode Guide

---

#### 1x01 — "Piscina: Capacitas Nova" (New Capacity)
**Status:** Fully outlined (see 1x01-piscina-capacitas-nova.md)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] SG-1 tracks Borg activity to a poker game, kills a golem, meets Duncan MacLeod. Duncan reveals the Borg threat. Alliance with Immortals (Casey, Methos). Assault on the Spanish mission. Discovery of the temporal Stargate. Through the gate to Nova Roma. Meeting Midas, Pliny, Marcus. Carter identifies memory allocation as the foundation. The first code: `structura Piscina`.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Team formation. SG-1 meets Immortals. Duncan's resurrection reveals Immortality. Nova Roma discovered — a clean, uncompromised civilization.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith):** When the team prepares to enter the mission, Casey crosses himself. Brief. Silent. The camera catches it without comment. Duncan doesn't react — he's seen Casey do this for decades. First visual seed.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Stinger — Data and Kirk arrive on Earth via temporal displacement. Data: damaged, green-eyed, mechanical. Kirk: gasping, vulnerable, human. The misdirect begins.

**Tag:** [UNCHANGED] Carter and Casey at dawn. *Piscina est fundamentum.*

---

#### 1x02 — "Credo" (I Believe / I Trust)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] First tests of Piscina. Introduction of the Credo testing framework. Teal'c writes the test suites with terrifying thoroughness.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Kirk arrives, is exposed, escapes. Data joins the team. The Reversal.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith):** Casey's workbench in the mission has a small crucifix on the wall. Not prominent. Just there. When Data is first brought to Casey's workbench for analysis, the camera frames Data's green eyes against the crucifix behind Casey's shoulder. A visual rhyme: two kinds of faith, two kinds of trust.

**C-Plot Enhancement (Historical Context):** The episode title "Credo" gains additional resonance. The Nicene Creed — *Credo in unum Deum* — is the foundational statement of Catholic faith. The testing framework and the creed share a root: what do you trust, and why? Casey would know this. He doesn't say it. The audience can find it.

**Theme:** Trust through verification. The testing framework as epistemology.

---

#### 1x03 — "Verba Nova" (New Words)
**Library:** Chorda (strings) + Chorda Aedificator (string builder)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Daniel and Lucia Serena clash over text representation. Length-prefixed, not null-terminated. The first structured report for the Nova Roma senate.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Daniel's arc begins. Lucia establishes herself. O'Neill catches a bug.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Historical Flashback — Casey):** Casey's IBM tabulating machine days intercut with the chorda work. The flashback shows Casey watching the transition from fixed-length punch card fields to null-terminated C strings. He argued against null termination at the time. "A string should know its own length. That's just common sense." He was overruled. Forty years later, buffer overflows became the most exploited vulnerability in computing history. Now, on Nova Roma, Lucia independently arrives at the same conclusion Casey reached in 1952. **The nominalism connection:** Null-terminated strings are nominalist — the string has no intrinsic property of length; you have to scan it to find out. Length-prefixed strings are realist — the string *knows* what it is. Casey smiles when Lucia explains her reasoning. He doesn't say "I told them so." He just smiles.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Reports of Kirk sightings.

---

#### 1x04 — "Codex Tabulae Exponentialis" (The Growing Ledger)
**Library:** Xar (variable-length array)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Marcus and the census. Growth without destruction. Roman roads.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Marcus's engineering intuition. Duncan's realization about building vs fighting.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Historical Flashback — Duncan):** Duncan watches Casey and Carter building and realizes he's been fighting, not building. Flash to a BRIEF memory — not the full Florence flashback (deferred to S2), but a fragment: Duncan in a medieval town, watching a cathedral go up stone by stone. The builders don't carry swords. He does. He leaves before it's finished. He always leaves before things are finished. Present-day: he watches Marcus laying digital foundations. He stays.

**C-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith):** Casey's rosary is visible in his pocket when he reaches for something. Marcus notices the beads. "What are those?" Casey: "They help me count." Marcus, the census-taker: "Count what?" Casey: "Prayers." Marcus considers this. Nods. He counts things too.

---

#### 1x05 — "Tabularium Novum" (The New Archive)
**Library:** Tabula Dispersa (hash table) + Friatio (hash functions)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Pliny's encyclopedia searchable. Hashing as *friatio*. The fingerprint of knowledge.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Pliny spotlight. Casey and Pliny bond. Teal'c's unexpected test failure.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Pliny and Casey's Faith):** Pliny asks Casey what he does when the weight of memory becomes too heavy. Casey: "I pray." Pliny: "To whom?" Casey: "The God who remembers everything." Pliny, the scholar who has spent eighty years trying to record everything: "That... would be a considerable memory." He's intrigued. Not converted. Intrigued. The polymath has found a new subject.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] First Midas temporal anomaly. Compass spinning. Carter notices.

**C-Plot Enhancement (Black Stone Seed):** When the compass spins near Midas, Methos is in the background. His expression shifts — barely perceptible. He's seen temporal artifacts before. He doesn't speak. But something old wakes up behind his eyes.

---

#### 1x06 — "Unum Pro Omnibus" (One For All)
**Library:** Internamentum (string interning)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Interning — canonical copies, compare by pointer. The mirror of the Borg: they *assimilate*, we *intern*.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Methos reveals knowledge of Alexandria. Data and Midas friendship deepens.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Historical Flashback — Methos/Cybele Seed):** Methos's accidental Alexandria revelation is enhanced. When Daniel presses him — "You were THERE?" — Methos's memory flashes: not just the Library, but something deeper. A priestess in Alexandria, guarding something in a sub-chamber. A black stone. Ecstatic rites that made people... different. "There were cults in Alexandria that the scholars didn't document. Cults that were older than the library. Older than Egypt." He stops himself. Changes the subject. Daniel notices the deflection. Files it.

**The Borg/Interning parallel deepens:** When Methos explains interning — "The Borg assimilate, making everything identical. We intern, making things canonical while preserving their source" — the flashback to Alexandria's cults gives this line additional weight. Methos has seen assimilation before the Borg. He's seen cults that absorbed identity. He's speaking from experience he hasn't fully shared.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Tech company acquisition. Duncan recognizes Kirk's pattern. More Midas anomalies.

---

#### 1x07 — "Tabulae Ceratae" (Wax Tablets)
**Library:** Filum (file I/O)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Saving work. Wax tablets vs stone inscriptions. Read, write, append.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Pliny and O'Neill. Joe Dawson's introduction. Joe and Pliny meet and recognize each other — two documentarians.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Historical Flashback — Preservation Theme):** Joe tells a story about a Watcher archive that was nearly lost — not to fire, but to neglect. "Nobody attacked it. Nobody burned it. We just... forgot to maintain the building. The roof leaked. Twenty years of records, water-damaged." This echoes Methos's later flashback (1x17) about knowledge dying from neglect, not invasion. The theme is planted early: the enemy of knowledge isn't destruction, it's indifference. **Nominalism link:** Indifference to preservation is a nominalist symptom — if knowledge is just information without intrinsic worth, why preserve it?

**C-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith):** Casey says grace before a meal at Pliny's villa. Quiet. Quick. O'Neill is across the table. Doesn't comment. Later, O'Neill to Duncan: "Did Casey just pray over Roman food?" Duncan: "He prays over everything." O'Neill: "Huh." That's it. No judgment. Just noticing.

---

#### 1x08 — "Horologium" (The Clock)
**Library:** Tempus (time management)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Casey tries to synchronize clocks. The readings don't match. Building the Tempus library in a place where time is warped.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Casey flashback. IBM tabulating machines. The Web3 breaking point. Thirty years alone.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Nominalism through Casey's History):** Casey's flashback is enhanced with the nominalism lens. Each era he witnesses represents a step on the nominalist progression:
- **1850s-60s:** First Death. The Industrial Revolution turning craftsmen into operators. "A cobbler makes shoes. A factory worker operates a machine. They stopped being something and started being interchangeable."
- **Early 1900s:** Casey at an efficiency lecture (Taylorism). People measured, optimized, reduced to functions. He walks out. (Seed for eugenics flashback in later seasons.)
- **1950s-70s:** IBM. Casey sees computing born from the military-industrial complex. Punch cards, mainframes — systems designed for institutions, not persons. But the craft is real. He respects the craft.
- **2010s:** The Web3 startup. Peak nominalism. "Decentralized governance for... something. Tokenized... something else." Nothing has a nature. Everything is a platform. Casey's breaking point.

The flashback structure shows the nominalist progression through one man's lived experience across 160 years. The audience absorbs the thesis without it being stated.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Someone goes dark. Kirk's network growing. Time discrepancy between worlds.

---

#### 1x09 — "Arbor Documentorum" (Tree of Documents)
**Library:** XML (parser/serializer, DOM tree)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Pliny's *Naturalis Historia Nova* in structured markup. Documents as trees.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Daniel and Pliny, scholar to scholar. O'Neill catches something in the XML structure.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith — Pliny's Questions Begin):** Pliny begins asking more systematic questions. "You say there is one God. But you pray to a woman — this Mary." Casey: "I ask her to pray for me." Pliny: "So she is an intermediary? Like a patron?" Casey considers this. "That's... actually not a bad way to think about it." Pliny nods. He understands patronage. The Roman social structure has prepared him for this concept in a way modern people wouldn't expect.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Intel fragments about Kirk.

---

#### 1x10 — "Lingua Nova Structurae" (New Language of Structure)
**Library:** STML (XML superset)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Carter extends XML to STML. Capture operators, fragments, transclusion.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Lucia's second major moment. Carter/Marcus deepens. Daniel coins a living term.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Nominalism — Extensibility as Moderate Realism):** Lucia's insight — "You've given the language room to grow" — is enhanced with a philosophical beat. Lucia: "Your old system treated all things the same. Attribute, element, text — interchangeable containers. Your new system lets things be what they are. A fragment is not an element wearing a costume. It IS a fragment." Carter, surprised by the philosophical precision: "That's exactly the design principle." Lucia: "It is also the first principle of any sound philosophy."

**C-Plot Enhancement (Gilfoyle & Dinesh — INTRODUCTION):** Earth-side scene. O'Neill, investigating Kirk's tech acquisitions, identifies G&D's company as the one major AI firm that hasn't been acquired, hasn't pivoted, hasn't gone to the weird retreats. Cut to their office: a cluttered, productive mess. Gilfoyle deletes another "visionary leadership summit" email without reading it. Dinesh: "What if it's something important?" Gilfoyle: "Name one important thing that has ever come from a leadership summit." Brief, establishing scene. The tone is immediately, recognizably Silicon Valley.

---

#### 1x11 — "Praeparate, Pars Prima" (Prepare, Part One)
**Library:** Nuntium (protobuf-style binary serialization) — crisis-driven

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Kirk's network strikes. First on-screen Kirk since 1x02. Suit, boardroom, no green eyes.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Nuntium built under crisis pressure. Roman military dispatch analogy.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith Under Pressure):** Before the critical Nuntium deployment, Casey crosses himself. Marcus, working beside him, sees it clearly. After the deployment succeeds: Marcus: "Your gesture before we began. A prayer for success?" Casey: "A prayer for the right outcome. Not always the same thing." Marcus: "Your god distinguishes between them?" Casey: "My God invented the distinction."

**C-Plot Enhancement (Gilfoyle & Dinesh — Crisis Contact):** During the crisis, O'Neill reaches out to G&D as a potential secure relay. Gilfoyle: "We don't do government contracts." But Gilfoyle has started a file. He's noticed the pattern of acquisitions, the coordinated pivots, the CEOs who come back from retreats sounding... identical.

**Cliffhanger:** [UNCHANGED] The team is split. Communications down.

---

#### 1x12 — "Praeparate, Pars Altera" (Prepare, Part Two)
**Library:** Nuntium completion

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Resolution. Both teams survive. Kirk driven back but not caught.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Cost counted. Ally lost. Data proves essential. Teal'c trains Romans.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Gilfoyle & Dinesh — Post-Crisis):** Brief Earth-side beat. The crisis has made the news — "Coordinated infrastructure attacks." Gilfoyle is watching. He pulls up a screen: the investor emails, the CEO behavior changes, the acquisitions map, now the infrastructure attacks. The beginnings of The Binder.

**C-Plot Enhancement (Gilfoyle Notices the Pattern):** "Every company that was attacked yesterday had a CEO who attended the Napa retreat. Every company that WASN'T attacked had a CEO who didn't." Long pause. Dinesh: "...That's a coincidence." Gilfoyle stares at him with the infinite patience of a man who has never once believed in coincidences.

**Tag:** [UNCHANGED] Quiet aftermath. "We need to build faster." / "We need to build *better*."

---

#### 1x13 — "Aurum" (Gold)
**Library:** None — mythology/character episode

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Midas flashback. Phrygia, 8th century BC. The temporal artifact. "Golden touch" reinterpreted. Exile, wandering, arrival in Nova Roma.

**A-Plot Enhancement (The Black Stone of Cybele):** The temporal artifact is a stone. Black, dense, oddly warm. The Phrygian priests keep it in a mountain shrine. They call it "the Mother's heart" — a gift from Cybele. The ecstatic rites around the stone involve rhythmic chanting, trance states, and participants who emerge... changed. Some don't age right afterward. Some have temporal stutters. Most recover. Midas doesn't. When young Midas touches the stone, the temporal instability becomes permanent. The priests exile him — he's been touched too deeply.

**The audience sees:** The stone is clearly technology, not magic. The "cult" is a pre-scientific community organized around a Borg artifact they don't understand. The Cybele connection is explicit for mythology-literate viewers.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Post-crisis recovery. Joe opens a bar in Nova Roma.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith — The Bar):** Casey asks if he can put a small cross up behind the bar. Joe: "Sure. My bar in Seacouver had a Highlander sword on the wall. A cross is tamer." It becomes part of the bar's character.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Carter reviews temporal data. Audience gets the pieces. Carter almost understands.

---

#### 1x14 — "Invenire et Eligere" (Find and Choose)
**Library:** Selectio (CSS selector engine)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Selectors for STML documents. The Roman *quaestio* — formal inquiry.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Teal'c spotlight. Roman tester writes elegant query. Sleeper agent discovered.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Historical Flashback — Finding Hidden Things):** The Selectio theme — "how do you find something hidden in something complex?" — pairs with a Methos micro-flashback. Brief memory: Methos in a medieval court, watching an inquisitor ask questions. Not the violent kind — the intellectual kind. A formal process for finding truth hidden in contradiction. **Nominalism link:** The formal inquiry tradition (rooted in moderate realism — truth exists and is findable) versus the sleeper agent (nominalist tactic — nothing is what it seems, identity is a mask).

**C-Plot Enhancement (Gilfoyle & Dinesh — Danny Introduction):** Earth-side. Dinesh mentions "this guy Danny" to Gilfoyle. "He has a podcast. Really into The X-Files. But also conspiracy stuff — patterns in the tech industry, weird things happening in small towns." Gilfoyle: "Podcasts are the lowest form of media." Dinesh: "He's funny! And some of his stuff about CEO behavior changes is... actually kind of similar to what you've been tracking." Gilfoyle says nothing. Which, with Gilfoyle, means he's listening.

---

#### 1x15 — "Aquaeductus" (The Aqueduct)
**Library:** TCP (networking)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] First computer-to-computer connection. The digital aqueduct. Marcus sees the parallel instantly.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Marcus leads a system design for the first time. Carter steps back.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Pliny's Faith Questions — Ongoing):** Pliny and Casey in the library, evening. Pliny has his list of questions. They're on question seven. Pliny: "You say your god became a man." Casey: "Yes." Pliny: "And died." Casey: "Yes." Pliny: "And returned." Casey: "Yes." Pliny: "I have documented many extraordinary claims. This is the most extraordinary. And yet it is the only one where the witnesses gained nothing by lying. They were killed for it." Casey: "That's... actually one of the better arguments, yeah." The scene is warm, intellectual, unhurried.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Security concerns foreshadowed. TLS crisis ahead.

---

#### 1x16 — "Vigiles" (The Night Watch)
**Library:** Reactor (event loop)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Event-driven programming through the lens of Roman vigiles. One thread, many connections.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Teal'c spotlight. Kel'no'reem parallels. Casey and Teal'c working together.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Gilfoyle & Dinesh — The Missed Dinner):** Brief Earth-side comedy beat. Gilfoyle and Dinesh were supposed to attend a "visionary leadership summit" dinner. Gilfoyle's home server crashed. They spent the evening debugging instead. The next week, all three founders who attended have announced identical "unified vision" platform pivots. Same words, same order, across three different companies. "Trend-following doesn't produce identical press releases, Dinesh."

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Kirk intercepts a transmission. Tension toward TLS.

---

#### 1x17 — "Quinque Milia Annorum" (Five Thousand Years)
**Library:** None — mythology/character episode

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Methos flashback. The lost library, knowledge dying from neglect. Present-day: Methos writing things down.

**A-Plot Enhancement (The Black Stone in the Lost Library):** Methos's lost library contained more than scrolls. In a sealed sub-chamber: artifacts. Among them — "A stone. Black. Dense. The priests who guarded it said it whispered to them. They heard instructions — how to build things, how to organize, how to... expand." Daniel: "That's not Goa'uld." Methos: "No. It was something else. Something older." Daniel: "What happened to it?" Methos: "When the library fell, I assumed it was lost. But stones survive fire better than scrolls." He pauses. "Someone has it. Someone has always had it."

**The Cybele connection for attentive viewers:** The "stone that whispers instructions" matches the "Mother's heart" from Midas's flashback in 1x13. The Cybele cult in Phrygia, the mystery rites in Alexandria, the guardians in the library. A thread across millennia. The audience can connect it; the characters don't. Yet.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Methos and Pliny sharing wine and manuscripts. "How do you bear it?" / "You don't bear it. You just keep writing."

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith — Methos Notices):** Methos sees Casey praying outside the bar. Later, to Duncan: "Your cowboy prays." Duncan: "He always has." Methos, after a long pause: "I knew men who prayed like that in the second century. Before it was fashionable. Before there were churches. They met in houses and shared bread and they were — " He stops. Duncan waits. Methos: "They were the most irritating people I ever met. And they were right about some things I didn't want them to be right about." He drinks. Scene ends.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] The Ra connection seeded. Goa'uld device in the lost library. Daniel notices. Season 2 thread planted. (Now enhanced: the Ra artifact and the Black Stone are NEAR each other in the library but not the same object. Two different ancient technologies in proximity. Two threads for Season 2.)

---

#### 1x18 — "Arcanum" (The Secret)
**Library:** TLS (encrypted connections) + Base64

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Bottle episode. Kirk has intercepted transmissions. He knows about Nova Roma. Lockdown. Encryption from scratch.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Base64 necessity. O'Neill's not-dumb question. Duncan's spy tradecraft. Carter runs temporal tests.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Historical Flashback — Secrets and Hidden Knowledge):** Duncan's "centuries of spy tradecraft" given a specific flashback: Duncan in Elizabethan England, watching Catholic priests smuggle themselves into Protestant England. Priest holes — hidden rooms in manor houses. Cipher letters. Networks of trust built in secret. The priests risk death to celebrate Mass for people who risk death to attend. Duncan, not Catholic himself, helps because he respects courage. "I've seen every way secrets get compromised. The ones that survived were the ones where the people keeping them believed something was more sacred than their own safety." **This connects Casey's faith, the encryption theme, and Duncan's character in one beat.** The historical Catholic underground illuminates TLS: encryption as the digital priest hole.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith — Prayer During Lockdown):** During the tense lockdown night, Casey prays the rosary openly. Not performatively — he's stressed, this is what he does. A Roman woman watches, curious. Later asks Lucia: "He speaks to his god. The one god." Roman: "Does it help?" Lucia: "He seems calmer afterward. Whether that is the god or the counting, I do not know." A beat. "Both, perhaps."

**C-Plot Enhancement (Gilfoyle & Dinesh — O'Neill's Warning):** O'Neill contacts G&D again during the crisis. This time Gilfoyle stays on the line longer. O'Neill: "The hardware. The chips. You trust them?" Gilfoyle: "...Define trust." O'Neill: "Can you audit your supply chain? All of it. Down to the silicon." Gilfoyle: "Nobody can audit that far down." O'Neill: "Exactly." The chip audit begins.

**Danny Podcast Seed:** During the lockdown, someone's phone plays a podcast in the background — a British voice: "—the thing about patterns, right, is that once you see them you can't UNsee them—" Someone turns it off. The moment passes. The audience hears the voice. Files it.

---

#### 1x19 — "Nuntii Structurati" (Structured Messages)
**Library:** JSON (parser, builder, serialization)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Data leads JSON implementation. Wartime engineering (Nuntium) vs peacetime (JSON).

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Data's first major technical contribution. Team trust turns. Romans approach Data.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith — Data's Question):** Data and Casey working side by side. Data: "Casey. You believe in a soul." Casey: "I do." Data: "Is a soul an entity?" Casey, surprised: "That's... actually a good question. It's a thing that exists. It has properties. It can't be reduced to its properties." Data: "It is sovereign over its own state." Casey: "I... yeah. I guess you could say that." Data: "Then your theology and our architecture agree." Casey: "Huh." Long beat. Data returns to the parser.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Carter and Data see Kirk's pattern. Joe's Watcher records reveal connections. Kirk has been working toward the gate.

#### 1x20 — "Compressio" (Compression)
**Library:** Flatura (DEFLATE/gzip)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Compression. Huffman encoding. The sliding window. Latin rhetoric as compression.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Pattern theme connects to Kirk. O'Neill catches a critical flaw.

**C-Plot Enhancement (Gilfoyle & Dinesh — The Discovery):** THE KEY SCENE. Gilfoyle has the electron microscope results. On screen: chip imagery. Structures in the silicon that shouldn't be there. Not software. Not firmware. Physical structures in the transistors themselves. Gilfoyle, very quiet: "This isn't a backdoor. This is in the PHYSICAL STRUCTURE." Different chip. Different fabricator. Same structures. "Every chip, Dinesh. Every foundry." The audience now knows G&D have independently discovered the ASML compromise.

**Danny Podcast Enhancement:** Dinesh, spiraling, calls Danny. "I need to talk to someone who won't think I'm crazy." Danny's voice (we don't see his face): "Mate, you've called the EXACTLY right person. Go on." The audience hears Danny take Dinesh seriously — with the earnest intensity of a man who has been waiting for this call.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Kirk is moving toward the gate. Carter's temporal theory. Gaius Tertius optics breakthrough.

#### 1x21 — "Forum Digitale, Pars Prima" (The Digital Forum, Part One)
**Library:** HTTP (client, server, request parsing, response building)

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] The culmination. Every library converges. First web server on Nova Roma. Marcus and Roman engineers as partners.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Ensemble episode. Casey: "Turns out you need people." Duncan chooses defense over offense.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith — Before the Storm):** Casey is in the mission chapel (a quiet corner with the crucifix). Duncan finds him. "Ready?" Casey: "Almost." Duncan waits. Casey finishes. Stands. "Now I'm ready." Duncan: "You really believe all that?" Casey: "I've been alive for two hundred years, Duncan. The thing that's kept me sane isn't code." Duncan doesn't argue. They walk out together. Two Immortals heading into what might be a battle. One armed with a sword, one armed with a rosary.

**C-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Kirk assaults the mission. O'Neill and Duncan hold the perimeter. Kirk reaches the gate.

**Cliffhanger:** [UNCHANGED] Kirk steps through.

---

#### 1x22 — "Fundamentum" (The Foundation)
**Library:** HTTP completion — first page served on Nova Roma

**A-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Kirk on Nova Roma. The first web page loads. Marcus types a URL. The entire foundation working together.

**B-Plot:** [UNCHANGED] Data steps forward. Kirk/Data confrontation. Kirk transmits signal to the stars.

**B-Plot Enhancement (Casey's Faith — In the Finale Montage):** In the final sequence at Joe's bar — everyone together — Casey is visible in the background, rosary in hand, sitting quietly. Not praying, just holding it. The way you hold something familiar when you're at peace. The cross behind the bar is visible. The visual language of faith woven into the warmth of community.

**C-Plot Enhancement (Gilfoyle & Dinesh — Season Hook):** Post-credits or late episode. G&D's office, late at night. The chip images pinned to a wall. Gilfoyle has drawn connections — the investor emails, the CEO behavior changes, the chip structures, the infrastructure attacks. The beginning of The Wall. Dinesh: "So what do we do?" Gilfoyle: "That military guy called us twice. Both times during a crisis. Both times he asked about the hardware. He knows more than he told us." Dinesh: "Should we call him back?" Gilfoyle looks at the wall. "Yeah. Call him back." He reaches for the phone. Freeze on his hand. Cut to credits. Season 2 is now MANDATORY for anyone watching the Gilfoyle thread.

**Final Sequence:** [UNCHANGED]

Casey: "The foundation's laid."
Carter: "*Fundamentum positum est.*"

Methos and Pliny outside under the stars.

Carter's "Temporalis Anomalia" folder. She closes it. Not yet.

**Post-Credits Stinger:** [UNCHANGED] Deep space. Kirk's signal reaches something vast with green lights.

END OF SEASON ONE.

### Notes on Integration Philosophy

1. **Casey's faith never becomes a subplot.** It's always visual or brief conversational. No arguments, no crises of faith, no dramatic conversions. Just a man who prays, and people who notice. The accumulation over 22 episodes is what makes it powerful.

2. **Gilfoyle & Dinesh enter in their own register.** Their scenes are tonally Silicon Valley — comedy, bickering, paranoia that turns out to be justified. They don't feel grafted onto the show; they feel like a parallel story that will eventually converge.

3. **The Black Stone of Cybele works as mystery archaeology.** The audience gets pieces: Midas's stone in Phrygia (1x13), Methos's stone in Alexandria (1x17), the Cybele cult imagery. Attentive viewers will connect them. The show doesn't connect them yet. Season 2 material.

4. **Danny exists as a voice and a mention.** He's a presence, not a character, in Season 1. A British accent on a podcast. A name Dinesh mentions. The audience is intrigued but not introduced. The full Hot Fuzz entry is Season 2 territory.

5. **The nominalism thesis is NEVER stated.** It's shown through Casey's flashbacks (watching craft die, watching people become interchangeable), Lucia's philosophical observations (things should know what they are), and the Borg's philosophy (everything is raw material). The audience absorbs the argument by living through it with the characters.

*This revision adds approximately 3-5 minutes of screen time per episode in new B/C plot material, leaving all A-plots and serialized beats untouched. The new threads integrate with existing character dynamics (Casey/Pliny, Methos/Daniel, O'Neill's Earth-side operations) rather than requiring new character relationships that haven't been earned.*
