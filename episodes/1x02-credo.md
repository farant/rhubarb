# NOVUM FUNDAMENTUM
## Episode 1x02: "Credo"
### Beat Sheet (Draft 1 — Compiled from Writers' Room)

---

## COLD OPEN

**Scene 1: Data. Yellowstone. Night. Immediately after the 1x01 stinger.**

Data stands in the steam. He doesn't move. He CAN'T — motor systems too damaged. Internal servos whir and click. Self-diagnostics running behind green eyes.

We stay with him for 60-90 seconds. No dialogue. The hiss of geothermal vents. The audience thinks they're watching a Borg drone activating.

He takes one step. Falls. Gets up. Takes another. Each step a grinding effort.

**DIRECTION NOTE:** The camera should treat Data like a horror movie monster. Low angles. The green eyes in steam. Mechanical sounds in primordial landscape. Every visual cue says THREAT.

Headlights. A park ranger's truck on a distant road. Data turns toward it. Begins the long, broken walk.

**Hard cut to:**

**Scene 2: Kirk. Redwood forest. Same night.**

Kirk moves with purpose. Finds a ranger station. Breaks in. Clothes. A phone. He's efficient, resourceful, *human*.

He calls 911.

**KIRK:** My name is James Kirk. I was in an accident. I need help. There's another — a machine. It attacked me. I think it's heading east.

**DIRECTION NOTE:** The camera treats Kirk like the hero of a thriller. Handheld, intimate. His vulnerability is real. His fear looks genuine. Every visual cue says SURVIVOR.

He hangs up. Looks at himself in a mirror. Steadies himself. His hands are shaking.

The misdirect deepens: Kirk just reported Data to the authorities. He's weaponizing the truth — Data IS a machine, Data IS heading east. Kirk is the Corbomite Maneuver made flesh: his humanity is the bluff.

SMASH TO MAIN TITLES

## ACT ONE: "Probatio" (The Test)

*Building the test framework / Testing Kirk. The double helix begins.*

### Beat 1: Nova Roma — Morning After

**Location:** Pliny's villa. Morning light. Carter, Casey, Teal'c, Marcus. The Piscina code from last night glowing on Casey's air-gapped laptop.

Carter runs it. It works. She's satisfied.

Teal'c is not.

**TEAL'C:** You have demonstrated that it functions. You have not demonstrated that it is reliable.

**CARTER:** It passed the test.

**TEAL'C:** What test? You wrote instructions and confirmed they execute. That is not testing. That is rehearsal.

Casey backs Teal'c up. The test must be adversarial. You have to try to break it.

**MARCUS:** Like a siege. You do not test a wall by leaning against it. You test it with a battering ram.

Teal'c looks at Marcus. The barest acknowledgment. Respect between warrior and engineer.

They begin building the Credo framework. The structure of a test: setup, action, assertion. Daniel, translating: *Praeparare, agere, confirmare.*

**DANIEL:** What do we call the framework?

**TEAL'C:** *Credo.*

**DANIEL:** "I believe." "I trust."

**TEAL'C:** Trust that has been earned. A system that passes all tests has earned the right to the word.

### Beat 2: The Mission — Kirk Arrives

**Location:** The Spanish mission. O'Neill and Duncan on perimeter. News arrives: reports of a "machine" in Yellowstone. And a survivor — a man calling himself James Kirk.

Kirk arrives escorted by military. Cleaned up but still shaken. The classic Kirk charisma muted — a man who's been through something terrible.

**KIRK:** I was sent back. To warn you. The Borg — they won. In my timeline, they won. We tried everything. It wasn't enough.

He knows things. Ship classifications. Tactical details. Things that check out against SG-1's intelligence.

**O'NEILL:** And the machine? The one in Yellowstone?

**KIRK:** *(haunted)* Data. An android. Lieutenant Commander Data. He was my crewmate. But they got to him. The Borg. He's compromised. He's carrying Borg code — I saw it in his eyes. Green. The Borg color.

Kirk's story is internally consistent, emotionally compelling, and *technically true* — Data IS carrying Borg code (as evidence, not infection). Data's eyes DO glow green. Kirk uses real facts to construct a false narrative. This is essential for the reversal to feel fair.

### Beat 3: Duncan's Instinct

Duncan pulls O'Neill aside.

**DUNCAN:** Something about him. I can't place it.

**O'NEILL:** He checks out. Everything checks out.

**DUNCAN:** That's what worries me.

Duncan feels something around Kirk. Not the Buzz — the Immortal sense of another Immortal. Something else. Something *wrong*. Like hearing a chord where one note is off. A crowd compressed into one body. Four hundred years of reading people, and this is something new. He files it away.

### Beat 4: Kirk Integrates

Kirk is helpful. And he's GOOD. Strategic insights about the Borg that are genuinely valuable. He volunteers to help with defenses.

**Kirk and O'Neill bond:**

**KIRK:** *(watching the team work)* You know, where I come from, we had a saying about first contact situations.
**O'NEILL:** Yeah?
**KIRK:** "Try not to get killed." Pretty much covered everything.
**O'NEILL:** *(grins)* I like this guy.

**Kirk and Carter — he defers, admires, positions himself as subordinate:**

**KIRK:** You're handling the temporal displacement analysis yourself?
**CARTER:** Do you know something about it?
**KIRK:** Only what it felt like from the inside. *(beat)* You're the expert here. I'm just glad someone understands what happened to us.

**Kirk's tiny tells (rewatch details):**
- He never asks about the Borg tablets. Everyone else wants to know. Kirk already knows.
- He positions himself near technology. Not obviously — but track his blocking and he's always near a screen, a terminal, a device.
- He hasn't eaten since arrival. O'Neill offered. Kirk declined gracefully. Nobody notices.

### Beat 5: O'Neill's Instinct (Played as Comedy)

**O'NEILL:** *(to Carter, privately)* There's something about Kirk.
**CARTER:** What?
**O'NEILL:** I don't know. He's too... something.
**CARTER:** Too what?
**O'NEILL:** Too KIRK! Nobody's that Kirk. It's like he's doing an impression of himself.
**CARTER:** Jack, you just met him.
**O'NEILL:** Yeah, and within an hour I liked him. When does that happen? I don't like ANYONE within an hour. It took me three years to admit I liked Daniel.

The audience laughs. But O'Neill is RIGHT. This scene retroactively becomes the most important conversation in the episode.

### Beat 6: ACT BREAK

**Nova Roma.** Teal'c runs the first real Credo test on Piscina. It fails. A bug — not in the code. In the test itself. The test was wrong.

**TEAL'C:** A test can lie. Remember that.

Hard cut to Kirk's face. Smiling. Helpful. Passing every test.

---

## ACT TWO: "Inspectio" (Inspection)

*Deep-testing Piscina / Inspecting Data. The cracks appear.*

### Beat 7: Nova Roma — Testing Deepens

The Credo framework takes shape. Teal'c writes tests with terrifying thoroughness. Edge cases. Boundary conditions. What happens at the exact moment the pool grows? What happens when the inputs are hostile?

**TEAL'C:** *(handing Marcus a slate of test requirements)*

**MARCUS:** These are... extensive.

**TEAL'C:** These are minimum.

**MARCUS:** When do you stop testing?

**TEAL'C:** You do not.

A test fails. Marcus is frustrated.

**MARCUS:** It failed.

**TEAL'C:** *(satisfied)* Good. Now we know where the edge is.

**MARCUS:** *(beat, then slowly)* ...Good.

Marcus's growth moment: failure as information, not shame.

**Pliny watches, recognizing the method:**

**PLINY:** You are doing what we do with histories. Verifying each source against others. Finding where accounts disagree.

**TEAL'C:** Your method is sound.

**PLINY:** *(wryly)* I have had eighty years to refine it.

### Beat 8: The Mission — Carter Examines Data

**Location:** Casey's workshop, repurposed as containment. Data restrained — not cruelly, but firmly. Battle-damaged. One eye mechanism visible. Green glow. He looks frightening.

On the wall behind Casey's workbench: a crucifix. Small, wooden, unremarked. It's been there since Casey set up the space. Nobody comments on it. The camera doesn't linger. But it's *there* — and as Carter works on Data, the shot composition places Data's green eyes in the foreground with the crucifix soft-focused over Casey's shoulder. The machine and the cross. Two things that were broken and didn't stay dead. The audience won't consciously register this the first time. On rewatch, it's unmistakable.

Carter is repairing him. Surgeon's hands. As she works, she talks to Daniel.

**CARTER:** These damage patterns. Look at this.

She shows Daniel the scorch marks on Data's chassis.

**CARTER:** This isn't random. These burns are on his forearms, his chest. He was *blocking* something. And these cuts — on his back. He was running. Running and turning to fight. Then running again.

**DANIEL:** He was fighting Borg.

**CARTER:** He was fighting Borg *alone*.

First crack in the narrative. Kirk said Data was compromised. But Data's damage tells the story of someone who fought Borg, not someone who served them.

Carter goes deeper. She opens Data's chest panel. Not just mechanical damage inside — there are data storage modules. Intact. Deliberately protected even as the rest of him took damage.

**CARTER:** These storage modules... he shielded them. His arms took the worst hits because he was protecting his torso. Whatever's in these recordings, he thought it was worth dying for.

She begins extracting the data. **Data is the black box of a crashed civilization.** His body is the flight recorder of the future.

### Beat 9: Carter's Personal Stakes

As Carter works on Data, Daniel notices her hands are steadier than they should be. She's done this before — not with an android, but with something adjacent.

**DANIEL:** You okay?

**CARTER:** *(quiet)* Jolinar.

Daniel understands. Carter was involuntarily blended with a Tok'ra symbiote. She knows what it's like to have another intelligence inside your body. She looks at Data — carrying Borg code, mistaken for the enemy because of what's inside him.

**CARTER:** He's carrying something that isn't him, and everyone assumes that makes him the threat. *(beat)* I know what that's like.

This is personal. SG-1 deep cut. Carter's empathy for Data isn't generic kindness — it's survivor recognition.

### Beat 10: Kirk's Moment Alone

Kirk finds the mission's communications equipment. Studies it — just for a moment, when no one's watching. His expression doesn't change. But the camera lingers.

His hand twitches. Just once. A gesture too precise, too mechanical. He covers it by flexing his fingers like they're stiff from the cold.

It's nothing. Unless you know.

### Beat 11: Data's Recordings

Carter cracks the storage modules. Data's internal recordings begin to play on a screen.

Fragmentary. Corrupted. But clear enough: a future in ruins. The Borg victorious. And then — a specific recording. Two figures preparing for temporal displacement. Kirk and Data. Together. And then Kirk's eyes — glowing green. Before the displacement. Not after. BEFORE.

**CARTER:** *(staring at the screen)* Oh god.

She doesn't have the full picture yet. The recording is damaged. But she has enough: Kirk was assimilated before they traveled back. Not after. Before.

### Beat 12: Data Speaks

Carter works on Data's vocal processors. Delicate — her hands inside his neck, rerouting connections. Data is conscious, watching her with his one functional eye. Patient. Trusting her even though she has every reason to fear him.

A burst of static. Then, broken but intelligible:

**DATA:** Credo... Kirk... is Borg.

The assertion. Not "believe me." Not "trust me." *Credo* — I put forward this proposition to be tested. And then the test result: Kirk is Borg.

**CARTER:** *(already moving)* I know. I found your recordings.

**DATA:** *(stronger now)* His mission... the gate. He knows... everything I know. He will find the gate.

**CARTER:** He hasn't found it yet. He's been contained to the mission.

**DATA:** He has not eaten since his arrival. He does not need to. The Borg provide.

Carter's blood runs cold. O'Neill offered Kirk food. Kirk declined. Nobody thought twice about it.

### Beat 13: ACT BREAK

Data's damaged voice synthesizer:

**DATA:** He was the finest captain in Starfleet. He defeated the Kobayashi Maru. The no-win scenario. *(beat)* Now he IS the no-win scenario.

Hard cut to Kirk in the hallway. He heard something. A door closing. Footsteps moving with purpose. His smile doesn't change. But his eyes — just for a frame — calculate.

---

## ACT THREE: "Revelatio" (Revelation)

*The helix strands converge.*

### Beat 14: Nova Roma — The Adversarial Test

Intercut with Earth events. Teal'c runs the full adversarial suite on Piscina. Not just the obvious tests — what happens when the system is given deliberately bad input? What happens when something LIES about what it needs?

**TEAL'C:** A test that only confirms what you believe is not a test. It is a mirror.

The tests reveal that Piscina handles malicious input correctly. It rejects the lie.

On Earth, the team needs to apply the same principle.

### Beat 15: The Approach

Carter finds Duncan.

**CARTER:** We have a problem.

**DUNCAN:** I know. I've been watching him.

**CARTER:** Data says Kirk was assimilated before they traveled back. I found recordings in Data's memory. Kirk's eyes glow green in the footage. He's not a survivor. He's an advance agent.

Duncan nods. Four hundred years of reading people. Kirk was too perfect. And that wrongness he felt — the crowd compressed into one body — now it has a name.

**DUNCAN:** The Quickening. In my world, when an Immortal absorbs another's essence, sometimes the darkness wins. I've seen it. I've LIVED it. *(beat)* That's what I feel in him. Something taken over by something darker.

**CARTER:** Can he be saved? Can they be separated?

**DUNCAN:** I was. *(beat)* But I had friends who fought for me.

Methos appears. He's been listening.

**METHOS:** Kill him.

**DUNCAN:** Methos —

**METHOS:** Don't. I've watched threats fester for five thousand years because someone hesitated. Whatever Kirk was, he isn't that anymore. End it.

**DUNCAN:** You don't know that. There might be something of him left.

**METHOS:** There might be something of a lot of people left inside a lot of Borg drones. That's not a reason to invite them in for tea.

The tension between Immortals. Duncan wants to save. Methos wants to survive. Both are right. This thread persists for the series.

### Beat 16: The Confrontation

The courtyard. Open ground. They approach Kirk carefully. Carter, Duncan, Teal'c. O'Neill on the perimeter.

Kirk sees them coming. And knows. The way a poker player knows when the bluff is called.

**KIRK:** *(still smiling)* Colonel Carter. Duncan. Something wrong?

**CARTER:** Who sent you, Kirk? Really.

**KIRK:** I told you. I was sent to warn —

**TEAL'C:** *(stepping out behind him, staff weapon raised)* You were sent to infiltrate. Your story was constructed to pass inspection. But you forgot something.

**KIRK:** And what's that?

**TEAL'C:** A good test is adversarial.

Kirk's smile doesn't fade. It *changes*. Becomes colder. More honest. The mask slipping — not dramatically, just... the warmth drains out. Like someone turned off a light behind his eyes.

**KIRK:** You know, in my timeline — my real timeline — I was the best captain Starfleet ever had. I beat the Kobayashi Maru. *(beat)* This isn't a no-win scenario either.

His eyes glow green. First time since the 1x01 stinger. The color of VERITAS — the same green as a passing test. The Borg's color is the color of a test that says "I'm fine." The false positive made visible.

### Beat 17: Kirk's Escape

He doesn't fight. He doesn't transform into a golem. He RUNS. Fast. Inhumanly fast. The Borg enhancements aren't spectacle — they're speed, strength, processing.

The mission's electronics flicker as he passes. Doors respond to him. Lights shift. He moves through the building like it's part of him.

Duncan gives chase. Kirk reaches the perimeter. One last moment — he pauses. Turns.

**KIRK:** I'll see you again. I've seen your colony. I've met your Romans. *(beat)* They seem like good people. That's what we like best.

Gone. Into the night. Into the world. With everything he learned.

### Beat 18: Character Reactions

Each character processes differently:

**O'NEILL:** *(cold, military)* I had COFFEE with him. *(to Carter)* I TOLD you he was too Kirk.

**CARTER:** You did. I should have listened.

**O'NEILL:** *(no humor now)* Yeah. You should have.

**TEAL'C:** He passed every test you designed. You did not design the right tests. *(beat)* Indeed.

**CASEY:** *(real fear)* If they can take Kirk — a man who talked computers into self-destructing — and turn him into THIS? What chance does anyone have?

**DUNCAN:** *(quiet, to himself)* There's still someone in there.

**METHOS:** *(to Duncan)* I hope you're wrong.

### Beat 19: Data Accepted

They return to Data. His voice is stronger now. He gives them the full briefing: Kirk was assimilated before time travel. The Borg wanted him specifically — his charisma, his strategic brilliance, his ability to inspire trust. The perfect Trojan horse. The man who beat the no-win scenario, turned into the no-win scenario.

**DATA:** I could not destroy the evidence I carry. Even though it makes me appear as one of them. It was too important.

**O'NEILL:** So you carried proof of the enemy inside yourself, knowing everyone would assume you were the enemy.

**DATA:** It was the logical course of action.

**O'NEILL:** *(beat)* Welcome to the team.

### Beat 20: The Credo Framework Named

**Nova Roma.** The full Credo test suite runs on Piscina. Every test passes. Terminal output scrolls. Green text — VERITAS. But the *right* kind of green. The green of verified trust, not the green of Borg eyes.

**CARTER:** *(to Casey)* I want to name the testing framework.

**CASEY:** *Credo?*

**CARTER:** It's Latin. It means —

**MARCUS:** We know what it means, Colonel.

The Romans have been listening. Learning. Already claiming it.

O'Neill looks at the green test output on screen.

**O'NEILL:** So how do we know *those* are right?

**CARTER:** We wrote the tests.

**O'NEILL:** We trusted Kirk too.

Beat. Nobody has an answer. Because O'Neill just identified the recursion problem at the heart of epistemology: you have to trust SOMETHING. The question is what, and how deeply, and how often you re-examine it.

That's credo. Not certainty. Warranted, provisional, constantly-re-examined trust. Faith with open eyes.

---

## TAG

### Beat 21: Through the Gate

**The mission, night.** The gate shimmers. The team stands before it.

Data, repaired enough to function, stands with them.

**O'NEILL:** So we've got a Borg agent loose on Earth who knows where we are, an android who can't fully talk yet, and a civilization of Romans waiting for us to teach them to code. Tuesday.

**CARTER:** *(to Data)* Are you ready?

**DATA:** I do not know if I will be accepted.

**CARTER:** Neither were we. The Romans are thorough.

**DATA:** Then I look forward to being tested.

They step through.

### Beat 22: Nova Roma — Midas and Data

Nova Roma. Morning. The Forum Stellarum. Romans waiting.

Midas sees Data. Doesn't flinch. Walks up to him. Looks at the green eyes, the damaged face, the mechanical body.

**MIDAS:** You're the machine Carter told us about. The one Kirk was afraid of.

**DATA:** I am an android. I am not certain Kirk was afraid of me.

**MIDAS:** *(grinning)* Trust me. Anyone who runs that fast is afraid of something. Come on. I'll show you around. Have you ever had Roman wine?

**DATA:** I do not consume liquids for sustenance.

**MIDAS:** Neither do I, technically. But it's not about sustenance. It's about sitting with someone.

Data looks at Midas. The first person to treat him as a person, not a threat or a specimen. Two beings who are more important than anyone realizes — the unknowing MacGuffin and the black box of the future — finding friendship in the quiet.

**DATA:** I would... like that.

They walk into Nova Roma together.

FADE TO BLACK.

---

## STINGER

Deep space. Silent. Somewhere on Earth, Kirk stands on a hill overlooking a city. The lights below. All those microchips. All those systems. All those trusting people.

His green eyes reflect the city lights.

He opens a laptop — stolen, modern, connected. His fingers move across the keys with inhuman precision. Not searching. Building. The first node of a network that will take twenty episodes to reveal.

A single line of code on the screen. We don't see what it does. But the cursor blinks green.

SMASH TO BLACK.

END OF EPISODE

---

## THEMATIC NOTES

**"Credo"** shifts meaning across the episode:
- Act 1: "I believe." Faith. Trust. The human instinct to believe the charming man.
- Act 2: "I assert." A proposition submitted for testing. Carter's forensic analysis.
- Act 3: "I have tested, and the test has passed." Warranted, earned trust. Not certainty — provisional confidence built on evidence.
- Tag: Both meanings simultaneously. "I look forward to being tested."

**The False Positive and the True Negative:**
- Kirk is a false positive. Passes human verification (charming, helpful). IS the threat.
- Data is a false negative. Fails human verification (mechanical, green-eyed). IS the ally.
- A test framework that only confirms what you believe is a mirror, not a test.

**Green = VERITAS = Borg:**
- Credo test output: green text for VERITAS (pass).
- Borg eyes: green glow.
- The color of "I'm fine" is the color of "you're compromised."
- The false positive made visual.

**Genre Architecture:**
- T2 misdirect (Data=Arnold, Kirk=T-1000) with camera direction reinforcing it
- Kobayashi Maru inversion: the test-breaker became the test that breaks trust
- Dark Quickening parallel: Duncan recognizes technological possession
- Data as black box: the forensic evidence that cracks the misdirect
- Carter/Jolinar: personal stakes from SG-1 lore
- Methos vs Duncan: kill him vs save him — persists across the series

**Credo / Nicene Creed Resonance:**
- The episode title is "Credo" — the first word of the Nicene Creed. *Credo in unum Deum.*
- The testing framework and the creed share a root: what do you trust, and why?
- Teal'c's credo is empirical — trust earned through adversarial testing. The creed's credo is theological — trust given to what cannot be tested but has been witnessed. Both are acts of warranted belief. Both reject blind acceptance.
- Casey's crucifix on the workbench wall is the visual bridge. He lives in both credos simultaneously and sees no contradiction. The show doesn't explain this. It simply presents a man who tests his code and prays before missions, and treats both as serious.

**Connection to the series:**
- *Fides quaerens intellectum* — faith seeking understanding. The show's long-term epistemological position.
- Credo establishes the *method* for everything that follows. Every library gets tested. Every assumption gets examined. The epistemology comes before the technology.

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Joe Dawson.** Does he appear in this episode? If so, what role? Maybe he arrives at the mission with the Immortals and serves as chronicler of the Kirk arrival.

2. **Lucia Serena.** Any Nova Roma B-plot beyond Marcus? The testing philosophy could interest her as an educator.

3. **The gate knowledge.** Kirk says "I've seen your colony" — but did he actually go through the gate? Or did he just learn about Nova Roma from conversations? Important for continuity.

4. **Data's repair timeline.** How functional is he by the end of the episode? Partially repaired (still damaged, limited) feels right for ongoing tension.

5. **Kirk's escape route.** Does he go through a door? Over a wall? Through the gate briefly? His escape needs to feel earned but not make the team look incompetent.
