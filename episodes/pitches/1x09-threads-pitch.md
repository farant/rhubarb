## 1. CASEY'S FAITH THREAD: Pliny's Systematic Questions Begin

### The Setup

The season outline is explicit for 1x09: **"Pliny begins asking more systematic questions. 'You say there is one God. But you pray to a woman — this Mary.' Casey: 'I ask her to pray for me.' Pliny: 'So she is an intermediary? Like a patron?'"**

This is a significant escalation. Previous faith beats have been *reactive* — someone notices Casey's practice and asks a brief question. Now Pliny *initiates*. He comes to Casey with prepared questions. The polymath who has spent eighty years collecting information has added Casey's religion to his research program.

### The Beat

**Location:** The workshop. Late in the day. The team has been building the XML parser — Pliny has been deeply engaged with the A-plot (his encyclopedia IS the test data for the tree structure). But now the work is pausing. Pliny approaches Casey. He has a wax tablet. There are notes on it.

**PLINY:** *(sitting down beside Casey, the tablet in his hand — this is an interview, and Pliny interviews like a scholar)* Casey. I have been observing your devotional practice for some time. I have questions. Systematic questions.

**CASEY:** *(looks at the tablet. Sees numbered items. A small smile — this is very Pliny.)* Go ahead.

**PLINY:** You say there is one God.

**CASEY:** Yes.

**PLINY:** But you pray to a woman. This Mary.

**CASEY:** I ask her to pray for me.

**PLINY:** *(writing)* So she is an intermediary? Like a patron?

Casey considers this. The Roman patronage system — a patron intercedes with the powerful on behalf of clients. It's not a perfect analogy but it's closer than most modern frameworks. Pliny's Roman worldview has prepared him for this concept in a way that a 21st-century secular materialist's wouldn't.

**CASEY:** That's... actually not a bad way to think about it.

**PLINY:** *(nodding, writing more)* A patron of extraordinary rank. The mother of your God.

**CASEY:** Yes.

**PLINY:** *(looking up from his tablet)* And the beads. Your counting practice. What are you counting?

**CASEY:** Prayers to her. And meditations. On the life of her son.

**PLINY:** *(beat — the scholar processing)* A repetitive devotional practice with structured meditation. We have something similar. The Salii — the priests of Mars — perform a ritual dance, stepping and counting, while reciting the Carmen Saliare. The steps are the counting. The words are the meditation. *(beat)* Yours is quieter.

**CASEY:** Mine doesn't involve dancing.

**PLINY:** *(a small smile — the first time Pliny has made anything resembling a joke about religion)* Perhaps it should.

A beat. Then:

**PLINY:** I have fourteen more questions.

**CASEY:** *(looking at the tablet, then at Pliny)* This is going to take more than one evening.

**PLINY:** *(the man who waited eighty years in Nova Roma)* I have been waiting eighty years for interesting answers. I can wait a few more evenings.

### Why This Episode

1. **Pliny is the spotlight character alongside Daniel.** The A-plot uses his encyclopedia as the data that needs tree structure. He's been staring at hierarchies all day. His mind is in "organizing knowledge" mode. Of COURSE he'd then apply that mode to Casey's religion — it's another knowledge domain to map.

2. **The patronage parallel is the season outline's specific instruction.** This is the beat the outline demands. Pliny's Roman frame of reference makes Marian devotion comprehensible — not identical to Roman patron-client relations, but RECOGNIZABLE. This is the Nightcrawler approach: Casey's faith becomes more understood by the people around him, not through argument but through cultural translation.

3. **"Fourteen more questions" seeds 1x14-16.** The season outline has Pliny bringing Casey "a list of questions — written out, numbered, organized" in 1x14-16. This is the BEGINNING of that list. Pliny starts collecting. By 1x14, the list will have grown.

4. **The Salii comparison is Pliny being Pliny.** He doesn't evaluate — he COMPARES. He places Casey's practice within his own frame of reference. The comparison is anthropological, not theological. Pliny is doing what he always does: documenting. The faith thread advances through Pliny's scholarly curiosity, not through any kind of preachiness.

### Escalation Table Updated

| Episode | Faith Beat | Mode | Who Notices |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1x01 | Crosses himself | Visual only | Nobody |
| 1x02 | Crucifix + Data visual rhyme | Visual + compositional | Camera |
| 1x03-04 | Rosary / "What are those?" / "They help me count" | Brief verbal — about object | Marcus |
| 1x05 | Two extended beats ("A man who died for everyone" / "The God who remembers everything") | Extended verbal — about faith | Pliny |
| 1x06 | Crucifix in frame | Visual — compositional REST | Nobody |
| 1x07 | Grace before meal / "He prays over everything" / "Huh." | Brief verbal — about practice | O'Neill |
| 1x08 | Rosary / "How many prayers?" / "Enough" + "Reminders. That I'm not in charge." | Two beats — communal + personal | Roman apprentice, Marcus |
| **1x09** | **Pliny's systematic questions. Patronage parallel. "Fourteen more questions." "This is going to take more than one evening."** | **Extended verbal — theological/cultural interview** | **Pliny (scholar-mode)** |

The pattern: individual noticing → cultural noticing → **systematic inquiry**. The faith thread transitions from "people notice Casey's practice" to "someone begins formally studying it." Pliny is the perfect vehicle — he's a scholar, not a convert. His interest is intellectual. But intellectual interest in Catholic theology, pursued with genuine curiosity, is how many real conversions have historically begun.

### Production Note

The wax tablet Pliny carries should echo the episode's A-plot: structured data. Pliny's questions about Casey's faith are ORGANIZED — numbered, categorized, methodical. The same mind that wants to structure his encyclopedia in XML wants to structure his understanding of this foreign religion. The tablet is the physical incarnation of the episode's theme: knowledge has natural hierarchy, and the tools for organizing it reveal its structure.

## 2. KIRK STINGER: Hierarchy as Weapon

### The Progression So Far

| Stinger | Kirk's Step | Mirror Library | Number | Word |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|------|
| 1x01 | Seed | — | — | — |
| 1x02 | Germination (laptop, first code) | — | — | — |
| 1x03 | First root (server farm) | Chorda | — | — |

| **1x09** | **First hierarchy (org chart, 9/31)** | **XML/STML** | **9/31** | **HIERARCHIA** |

### The Stinger

**Location:** Earth. Night. Kirk's office. The filing cabinets from 1x07. The dual-clock setup from 1x08 (analog and digital — the analog is still running, the digital reads a different time. Kirk has been tracking the drift). Kirk is at his desk. Not looking at monitors. Looking at paper.

He has a document spread in front of him. Hand-drawn. A tree structure. At the top: a single box. Below it: three boxes. Below those: seven more. Below those: dozens. It's an organizational chart, but not a corporate one. No names — just roles. Functions. Responsibilities. Each box has a designation, not an identity.

An aide enters with a folder.

**AIDE:** The Seattle cell is restructured. Three layers now, like you asked. Nobody below the second level knows anyone above it.

**KIRK:** *(not looking up from the tree)* Show me.

The aide produces a printed org chart. Kirk holds it next to his hand-drawn version. They match.

**KIRK:** *(pointing to a node in the tree)* This node. If it's removed, what happens to the branches below it?

**AIDE:** They're isolated. No upward communication path.

**KIRK:** *(satisfied)* Good. That's the design. If they capture any branch, the root survives. If they capture the root — *(beat)* — there is no root. The root is an abstraction. The tree doesn't have a center. It has a structure.

He turns to the whiteboard. The progression of words: TABULARIUM, LEXICON, ARCHIVUM, CHRONOGRAPHIA.

He writes: **9 / 31**

Below CHRONOGRAPHIA: **HIERARCHIA**

**KIRK:** *(looking at the org chart and the hand-drawn tree together)* They're building a tree to organize documents. *(beat)* I'm building a tree to organize people.

He pins the org chart to the wall. Next to it: the Midas temporal profile folder from 1x08. The CHRONOGRAPHIA notes. The clock drift data. The tree.

**KIRK:** *(to himself)* A tree with no root. A clock with no master. A structure that survives the loss of any node. *(long beat)* They think they're building a civilization. They're building my intelligence network's architecture for me.

SMASH TO BLACK.

### What This Means

Kirk stinger progression: seed → germination → root → branches → organization → standardization → persistence → timing → **hierarchy**. TABULARIUM → LEXICON → ARCHIVUM → CHRONOGRAPHIA → **HIERARCHIA**.

The dark mirror sharpens: the team builds a tree to give knowledge its natural structure (Pliny's encyclopedia organized by subject, by category, by species — realist hierarchy). Kirk builds a tree to give his operatives a *designed* structure — compartmentalized, resilient to capture, no natural center. Realist tree vs. nominalist tree. One reflects the structure of reality. The other imposes a structure to resist reality (namely, the reality of being caught).

Kirk's "tree with no root" is the anti-XML. XML has a root element. Every document has a single root from which all structure descends. Kirk's organization deliberately has NO true root — the "root" is an abstraction, a role anyone can fill. This is the nominalist version of hierarchy: structure without nature, organization without essence.

The gut-punch line: "They think they're building a civilization. They're building my intelligence network's architecture for me." Kirk is watching the team's technical progress and LEARNING from it. The same concepts the team uses to organize knowledge, Kirk uses to organize power.

## 3. JOE/METHOS PRIVATE CONVERSATION: The Reunion

### The Context

This has been deferred since 1x07. Joe arrived through the gate. Methos was at dinner. Three seconds of eye contact across the table. Since then: separate orbits. Joe with Pliny, Joe with O'Neill, Joe with Casey. Methos at his pillar, wine in hand, sardonic commentary, strategic distance. Neither has sought the other out. Both know the conversation is coming.

It's overdue. The thread appendix says "1x09 or 1x10. Private. Late night. Wine." This is the episode. Here's why: 1x09 is about structure — about how things organize naturally vs. how they're forced to organize. Joe and Methos's relationship is THE test case. The Watcher and the Watched. A relationship with an imposed structure (Watcher protocol: observe, don't interfere) that has always strained against its natural structure (they're friends, they have been for decades, the professional distance was always a fiction).

### The Beat

**Location:** Late night. Joe's temporary quarters — not the bar yet (that's 1x13), just a room near the Forum. Wine on the table. Methos appears without announcement. He's good at appearing without announcement.

**METHOS:** *(standing in the doorway, wine in hand — he brought his own)* Joe.

**JOE:** *(not surprised — he's been expecting this)* Methos.

A beat. Methos sits. They drink.

**JOE:** I've been here three weeks.

**METHOS:** I know.

**JOE:** You've been avoiding me.

**METHOS:** *(sardonic, but there's something underneath)* I've been sitting at a pillar drinking wine and making observations about other people's code. I haven't been avoiding anyone.

**JOE:** That's what avoidance looks like when you've had five thousand years to practice it.

Methos doesn't argue. Because Joe's right.

**JOE:** *(after a long drink)* The Chronicles have you as Adam Pierson. Watcher researcher. Born 1963. Died... well, you didn't die, you just stopped showing up. Your file is still open.

**METHOS:** You could close it.

**JOE:** I could. *(beat)* I haven't.

**METHOS:** Why?

**JOE:** Because closing a file means the story is over. *(beat)* And your story isn't over. It's the longest one we have.

Silence. Methos drinks. When he speaks, the sardonic edge is thinner.

**METHOS:** When I was in Alexandria — the real one, not the nostalgia version — there was a cataloguer. He spent forty years indexing scrolls. By the time he finished, the first scrolls he'd indexed had been recopied and the originals destroyed. He started over. He spent another thirty years. Then the Romans came and he started over again.

**JOE:** What happened to him?

**METHOS:** He died. Old. Still cataloguing. *(beat)* He was the happiest man in Alexandria. He'd found the thing that didn't end.

**JOE:** *(understanding)* The work.

**METHOS:** The work. *(long beat, then looking at Joe with something approaching directness)* You spent thirty years watching Duncan live. I spent five thousand years watching everyone die. We both chose the same thing — observation over participation. *(beat)* You're here now. Participating. Writing Pliny's chronicles into structured files. Building something instead of recording something.

**JOE:** So are you. The code comments. The three-voice moments. "The Borg overwrite. Civilizations append." That's not observation, Methos. That's testimony.

Methos is quiet for a long time. Then:

**METHOS:** Daniel asked me about Alexandria. *(careful)* About the lower levels. The things I saw there.

**JOE:** I know. I have the Watcher record. 280 BC. An observer noted a man matching your description fleeing the Serapeum. Running. A man who doesn't run from anything was running.

**METHOS:** *(very quiet)* What else does your record say?

**JOE:** That you didn't return to Alexandria for four hundred years. *(beat)* What did you see, Methos?

**METHOS:** *(the five-thousand-year-old man choosing his words like someone disarming a bomb)* Something I'm not ready to name. Not yet. *(beat)* But Daniel is asking the right questions. And he has better tools now than I had then.

**JOE:** The structured text. The STML analysis.

**METHOS:** Give a man like Daniel a way to cross-reference ancient documents with Watcher records and archaeological data in a structured format... *(he trails off)* He'll find what I found. But he'll understand it better than I did. I was a survivor. He's a scholar.

The scene ends. Two men who've been watching from the sidelines, now on the field. The Watcher's file on the world's oldest man is still open. The conversation isn't over. But it's started.

**Timing:** 120-150 seconds. This is a big scene — the longest C-plot beat in the season so far. It's earned. It's been building since 1x07.

### What This Does for the Thread Architecture

1. **Joe/Methos is no longer deferred.** The reunion happened. It was private, wine-soaked, and honest. It sets the tone for their relationship going forward: not professional (Watcher/Subject) but personal (two men who chose observation and are learning to participate).

2. **Methos OPENS THE DOOR to Daniel's investigation.** He doesn't reveal what he saw. But he acknowledges that Daniel is on the right track and has better tools (STML/XML) than Methos had. This is Methos giving implicit permission for the investigation to continue — the five-thousand-year-old man trusting a scholar to handle what he couldn't.

3. **Joe's Watcher records are CONFIRMED as useful.** The 280 BC observation is real. It corroborates what the audience learned in 1x07. Joe isn't just a bartender — he's a primary source.

4. **The "happiest man in Alexandria" story** is a Methos parable. The cataloguer who found "the thing that didn't end" — the work of organizing knowledge. This parallels the A-plot (organizing Pliny's encyclopedia into XML) and Joe's own transition (from Watcher to participant). The tree of documents is the thing that doesn't end.

---

## 4. DANIEL'S INVESTIGATION USING STML TOOLS

### The Setup

Daniel has been building a dossier since 1x06:
- **1x06:** Methos's tense-slip ("They..."), the Alexandria flash — sub-chamber, priestess, stone, cults
- **1x07:** Joe's Watcher records corroborate — 280 BC, Methos fleeing the Serapeum
- **1x08:** Background work, not spotlighted (Casey's episode)
- **1x09:** The XML/STML tools give Daniel what he's been missing — *structure*

### The Beat

**Location:** Daniel's workspace. He has physical notes spread across a table — printouts of Watcher records from Joe, his own translations of Methos's fragments, archaeological data he's been reconstructing from memory and from the team's library of Earth reference materials.

The problem: flat text. Everything is in flat files. The Watcher record says "280 BC, subject matching description fled Serapeum, lower levels." The Methos fragments say "sub-chamber, priestess, black stone, cults older than Egypt." Daniel's own archaeological knowledge says "Serapeum had restricted lower levels, multiple cults operated there, Cybele worship documented in Alexandria from 3rd century BC." But these are three separate documents with no cross-references. No links. No hierarchy.

Now Daniel has the XML parser.

```c
/* Arbor investigationis — structura documentorum Danielis */
<investigatio titulus="Alexandria-Serapeum">
  <fontes>
    <fons genus="testis" nomen="Methos" tempus="-280">
      <observatio>Fugit ex Serapaeo. Cucurrit.</observatio>
      <fragmenta>
        <fragmentum>Sub-cella. Sacerdos. Lapis niger.</fragmentum>
        <fragmentum>Cultus antiquiores quam Aegyptus.</fragmentum>
        <fragmentum>Verbum captum: "assimi—"</fragmentum>
      </fragmenta>
    </fons>
    <fons genus="vigil" nomen="Custos-280BC" tempus="-280">
      <observatio>Homo descriptioni congruens fugit ex Serapaeo.
                  Non rediit ad Alexandriam per CCCC annos.</observatio>
    </fons>
    <fons genus="archaeologicum" tempus="-250/-200">
      <observatio>Serapaeum inferiores cellae documentatae.
                  Cultus Cybeles in Alexandria a saeculo III a.C.n.</observatio>
    </fons>
  </fontes>
  <nexus>
    <connexio a="Methos/-280" ad="Custos-280BC"
              vis="Corroborat — idem eventus, duo fontes"/>
    <connexio a="lapis-niger" ad="Cybele"
              vis="Coniectura — lapis niger cultus Cybeles?"/>
  </nexus>
</investigatio>
```

**DANIEL:** *(to Pliny, who is watching with professional interest)* I can cross-reference now. Look — the Watcher record and Methos's fragments describe the same event, same year, same location. Two independent sources. And the archaeological evidence puts a Cybele cult in the Serapeum's lower levels during exactly that period.

**PLINY:** *(the scholar in him immediately engaged)* Three convergent sources for a single event. That is strong evidence. *(beat, looking at the XML structure)* Your tree. The root is the investigation. The branches are the sources. The connections between branches — those are your cross-references.

**DANIEL:** Exactly. And I can add more branches as I find more sources. The structure grows without losing coherence.

**PLINY:** *(quiet admiration)* This is what my encyclopedia lacks. I have thirty-seven books. Twenty thousand facts. But the connections between facts are in my head, not in the text. If I were to die — *(a beat, and both men feel the weight of Pliny's history with dying)* — the connections die with me. Your tree preserves the connections.

**DANIEL:** That's what XML does. It doesn't just store information. It stores the *relationships* between information.

### What Daniel Now Knows (and What He Doesn't)

**Knows:**
1. Methos was in Alexandria's Serapeum around 280 BC
2. He went to the lower levels (restricted area)
3. He saw a priestess, a black stone, and cults "older than Egypt"
4. He fled and didn't return for 400 years
5. The Watcher records independently confirm his flight
6. Cybele worship was documented in Ptolemaic Alexandria
7. The word Methos caught himself before saying started with "assimi—"

**Doesn't know:**
1. What the black stone IS (Borg artifact)
2. Why Methos ran (the "assimilation" he almost named)
3. The connection to Midas's Phrygian origin (Midas's stone in the same cult)
4. Whether the stone is still somewhere on Earth

**The dramatic irony:** The audience has seen Midas's flashback fragments (the Phrygian temple, the stone that changed him). The audience knows "assimi—" almost certainly means "assimilation." Daniel doesn't have these pieces yet. But his STML-organized dossier is building the connective tissue that will eventually reveal the pattern.

**Timing:** 60-90 seconds. Intercut with A-plot teaching scenes.

---

## 5. C-PLOT BEATS (4 Beats Interwoven)

### Beat C1 (Act 1-2): Carter's Emotional-State Experiment

**The Thread Appendix from 1x08 asks:** "Does the frequency shift with Midas's emotional state?" Carter now has precise tools (Tempus timestamps from 1x08) and structured data storage (the A-plot's XML, used here for her private analysis). She begins the next phase.

**Location:** Carter's workstation. She's built a logging system:

```c
/* Mensura continua — frequentia et status Midaeis */
<mensura tempus="47832.441892">
  <frequentia valor="0.00371" amplitudo="0.0041"/>
  <observatio>Midas in horto. Tranquillus. Cum herbis.</observatio>
</mensura>
<mensura tempus="48102.556723">
  <frequentia valor="0.00369" amplitudo="0.0043"/>
  <observatio>Midas in foro. Ridens. Cum Marco loquens.</observatio>
</mensura>
<mensura tempus="48814.339201">
  <frequentia valor="0.00382" amplitudo="0.0058"/>
  <observatio>Midas post disputationem de aquaeductu. Agitatus.</observatio>
</mensura>
```

The frequency shifts slightly when Midas is agitated. The amplitude increases. When he's calm, it's stable. When he's animated, it rises. Not dramatically — the difference is in the fourth decimal place. But it's there. The "heartbeat" accelerates under stress.

Carter saves the file. Structured now — not the flat text she started with in 1x05, but XML. Each measurement timestamped (Tempus), each observation tagged (STML structure), each correlation preserved.

**CARTER:** *(to herself, looking at the structured data)* It responds to his emotional state. It's not just alive. It's connected to him.

She closes the file. The burden deepens.

**Timing:** 45 seconds. Private. No dialogue except Carter's whispered line.

### Beat C2 (Act 2-3): Joe/Pliny Working Session — Structured Chronicles

**The thread continues from 1x08's first working session.** Now they have XML.

**Location:** Pliny's study. Joe and Pliny are converting Watcher records into structured format. Joe is dictating. Pliny is organizing.

**JOE:** Subject: Duncan MacLeod. First observation: 1625. Location: Scottish Highlands. Observer designation: W-4419.

**PLINY:** *(writing in the XML structure, which he's taken to with the passion of a man who has been organizing information for eighty years)* Wait. Your observer. W-4419. This observer also documented three other subjects in the same period?

**JOE:** How did you know that?

**PLINY:** *(pointing to the tree)* I cross-referenced. Your flat records listed the observer number in each entry but never connected them. In the tree, I grouped observations by observer. W-4419 was prolific — four subjects across Scotland and Northern England between 1620 and 1640. *(beat)* He was a good Watcher.

**JOE:** *(staring at the structured data)* I've been reading these records for thirty years. I never saw that connection.

**PLINY:** You didn't have a tree.

The scene does triple duty: advances the Joe/Pliny partnership, demonstrates the A-plot's utility (XML reveals hidden connections in flat data), and shows the Watcher records becoming a REAL resource — not just anecdotal corroboration but structured, cross-referenceable intelligence.

**Timing:** 45 seconds.

### Beat C3 (Act 3-4): O'Neill Files — Time Discrepancy Update

**Location:** O'Neill's quarters. He's reviewing the latest intelligence summaries. A new report from an Earth-side contact.

**O'NEILL:** *(to Joe, who has become his informal intelligence partner)* Two more contacts reporting timestamp irregularities. The gate transmissions from Earth arrive with clock drift. Not the same drift every time — it varies.

**JOE:** Like Casey's clocks.

**O'NEILL:** *(nodding)* Like Casey's clocks. The sinusoidal drift. But from the Earth side, it looks random because they don't know the frequency. *(beat)* Carter knows the frequency.

**JOE:** You going to ask her?

**O'NEILL:** *(long pause — O'Neill is the man who files everything and acts on nothing until the time is right)* Not yet. She'll tell me when she's ready. *(beat)* But I'm going to organize what I have. The way Daniel is organizing his investigation.

He opens an XML file. The audience sees: O'Neill has been learning from the A-plot too. He's building his own structured dossier.

```xml
<intelligentia titulus="Discrepantia Temporalis">
  <observationes>
    <obs tempus="..." fons="Ramirez" differentia="+6h"/>
    <obs tempus="..." fons="Contactus-2" differentia="+4h 12m"/>
    <obs tempus="..." fons="Contactus-7" differentia="+5h 38m"/>
  </observationes>
  <coniectura>Oscillatio sinusoidalis. Cf. horologium Casey.</coniectura>
</intelligentia>
```

**O'NEILL:** *(looking at the structured data, the same tone he used in 1x08 — "I don't like coincidences")* Three data points. Same phenomenon. Different magnitudes. *(beat)* If Carter's right that it's sinusoidal, then the magnitude depends on WHEN the message was sent relative to the cycle.

He's not a physicist. But he's a commander who understands patterns. And now he has the tools to organize them.

**Timing:** 45 seconds.

### Beat C4 (Tag area): Daniel/Lucia — The Tree as Natural Hierarchy

A brief scene that connects Daniel's investigation to the episode's philosophical core:

**DANIEL:** *(to Lucia, after a long day of building XML structures)* The tree structure. It's not arbitrary, is it? Pliny's encyclopedia isn't organized in a tree because trees are convenient. It's organized in a tree because knowledge IS hierarchical. Minerals belong to geology. Geology belongs to the natural sciences. The hierarchy isn't imposed. It's discovered.

**LUCIA:** *(the philosopher-linguist)* That is precisely correct. A tree that reflects the nature of what it contains is not a classification. It is a recognition. *(beat)* Your old system — the flat files, the unstructured text — treated all knowledge as equivalent. One fact next to another, no relation, no context. That is a nominalist data structure.

**DANIEL:** And the tree is realist.

**LUCIA:** The tree is honest. Things have natures. Those natures have relationships. The tree makes the relationships visible.

**Timing:** 30 seconds. Dense, philosophical, the episode's thesis stated through the characters who understand it best.

## 6. THREAD-BY-THREAD STATUS PROPOSALS: After 1x09

| Thread | Status After 1x09 | Next Beat |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Casey's Faith** | **SYSTEMATIC INQUIRY BEGINS.** Pliny approaches Casey with prepared questions. Patronage parallel for Marian devotion. "Fourteen more questions." "This is going to take more than one evening." The faith thread transitions from noticing to studying. | 1x10: Rest. 1x11-12: Under crisis pressure, Casey crosses himself before deployment. Marcus: "Before battle?" Casey: "Before everything." |
| **Kirk Stinger** | **9/31. HIERARCHIA.** Kirk builds a compartmentalized org chart — a tree with no root. "They think they're building a civilization. They're building my intelligence network's architecture for me." Kirk learning from the team's technical progress. | 1x10: Kirk mirrors STML's extensions — capture, fragments, transclusion as intelligence tools. |
| **C-Plot (Kirk/Earth)** | **NETWORK GROWING.** O'Neill tracking more contacts with timestamp irregularities. Kirk's org is becoming more structured. No new dramatic beats — the intelligence thread simmers while the Midas temporal and investigation threads advance. | 1x10-11: Escalation toward mid-season crisis. |
| **Joe Dawson** | **PARTICIPANT.** Joe/Methos private conversation happened. Joe/Pliny working sessions now use XML. Joe is no longer settling in — he's producing intelligence (structured Watcher data) that the team uses. | 1x10-12: More sessions. Bar scouting begins. Joe fully integrated. |
| **Joe/Methos** | **REUNION HAPPENED.** Private. Wine. Late night. Honest. Joe's file on Methos is still open. Methos gives implicit permission for Daniel's investigation. "He'll find what I found. But he'll understand it better than I did." The professional distance (Watcher/Subject) is gone. What remains is personal. | 1x10-12: Occasional scenes. They're comfortable now. The tension is released. What builds next is collaboration. |
| **Joe/Pliny Partnership** | **PRODUCTIVE.** XML transforms their collaboration. Pliny cross-references Watcher records in ways Joe never could with flat files. "You didn't have a tree." The documentary partnership has tools now. | 1x10-13: Deepening. By 1x13: the bar opens as second workspace. |
| **Black Stone / Cybele** | **INVESTIGATION ACCELERATED.** Daniel builds structured STML dossier. Three convergent sources (Methos testimony, Watcher records, archaeological evidence) now cross-referenced in XML. Methos implicitly blesses the investigation. Daniel knows: black stone, Serapeum lower levels, Cybele cult, 280 BC. He doesn't know it's a Borg artifact. | 1x10-13: Daniel adds more sources. By 1x13 (Midas flashback): the dossier connects to Midas's Phrygian origin. |
| **Midas Temporal** | **EMOTIONAL CORRELATION DETECTED.** Carter finds the frequency shifts with Midas's emotional state (amplitude increases when agitated). The "heartbeat" is connected to his psychology, not just his biology. Now stored in structured XML — organized, timestamped, cross-referenced. | 1x10-12: More data. The question becomes: does Midas know what he is? Carter's silence becomes harder to maintain. |
| **Nominalism / Realism** | **TREES AS REALIST STRUCTURES.** Lucia states the thesis: "A tree that reflects the nature of what it contains is not a classification. It is a recognition." Flat files are nominalist (all data equivalent). Trees are realist (data has natural hierarchy). Kirk's rootless tree is the nominalist counter — structure without essence. | Ongoing. Each library deepens. |
| **Pliny's Mortality** | **ENGAGED.** Pliny's line to Daniel — "If I were to die, the connections die with me" — acknowledges his mortality while the XML tree offers an answer: structure that preserves connections beyond the structurer. He's energized. The XML gives him a tool for immortality that doesn't require being immortal. | 1x13: Midas reveal hits Pliny hard — the man he's lived beside for eighty years IS the mystery. |
| **Data/Midas Friendship** | **BACKGROUND.** Data present in the A-plot teaching scenes but not spotlighted on the Midas thread this episode. | 1x10: Data may notice something about Midas's patterns through the structured-data lens. |
| **Daniel as Investigator** | **EMPOWERED.** Daniel now has STML tools for structured text analysis. His dossier is organized, cross-referenced, and growing. Methos has implicitly blessed the investigation. Pliny sees the methodology and admires it. The investigation has infrastructure. | 1x10-13: Daniel adds more sources. The investigation accelerates toward the Midas reveal in S2. |
| **Methos's Secret** | **DOOR OPENED.** Methos didn't reveal what he saw in Alexandria. But he acknowledged Daniel is on the right track. "He'll find what I found." The five-thousand-year-old man is, for the first time, trusting someone else to handle what he couldn't. The secret is no longer just Methos's burden — it's shared, in the sense that others are pursuing it with his knowledge. | 1x10-17: The secret remains. But Methos is less alone with it. |
| **Carter's Secret Burden** | **STRUCTURED + DEEPER.** Carter's data is now in XML — organized, timestamped, with emotional-state correlation. The burden is heavier (more evidence, more precision, now showing psychological connection) and better organized (the structured format makes it harder to dismiss). She needs to tell someone else. Casey knows about the frequency but not the emotional correlation. | 1x10-12: Carter's silence becomes untenable. The data demands disclosure. |
| **Earth-Side Seed** | **UNCHANGED from 1x08.** "Smart Town" chyron was placed in 1x08. No follow-up needed. | 1x10: Gilfoyle/Dinesh introduction per season outline. |
| **Time Discrepancy** | **MORE DATA POINTS.** O'Neill has three timestamp irregularities now (Ramirez + two more). He's building his own XML dossier. The intelligence thread and the physics thread are converging — O'Neill suspects what Carter knows. | 1x10-12: More data points. O'Neill will eventually ask Carter directly. |

## 7. THREAD INTERSECTION MAP

### Which Threads Touch Which Scenes

| Scene / Beat | Threads Present |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Pliny/Casey faith interview (workshop)** | Casey's Faith (escalation), Pliny (scholar-mode), A-plot resonance (structured questions = structured data) |
| **Joe/Methos late-night conversation** | Joe/Methos (REUNION), Methos's Secret (door opened), Black Stone/Cybele (Methos blesses investigation), Daniel as Investigator (empowered by proxy) |
| **Daniel's STML dossier (workspace)** | Daniel as Investigator (empowered), Black Stone/Cybele (three-source cross-reference), Nominalism/Realism (tree = realist structure), Joe/Pliny (Watcher records as source) |
| **Carter's emotional-state experiment** | Midas Temporal (emotional correlation), Carter's Burden (structured + deeper), Time Discrepancy (data accumulating) |
| **Joe/Pliny XML working session** | Joe/Pliny Partnership (productive), Joe Dawson (participant), A-plot utility demonstrated |
| **O'Neill timestamp dossier** | Time Discrepancy (more data), Kirk/Earth C-plot (network growing), O'Neill as intelligence analyst |
| **Daniel/Lucia nominalism/realism** | Nominalism/Realism (thesis stated), A-plot philosophy |
| **Kirk stinger** | Kirk Stinger (9/31, HIERARCHIA), Nominalism/Realism (rootless tree as nominalist hierarchy), Kirk learning from team's progress |

### Intersection Density

This episode has EXTREMELY high thread-intersection density because the A-plot tool (XML/structured markup) is a *meta-tool* — it's a tool for organizing other tools' output. Every thread that has been accumulating data (Carter's temporal readings, Daniel's investigation, O'Neill's intelligence, Joe's Watcher records) now benefits from the same technology. The XML parser is the infrastructure that connects previously separate threads. This is the first episode where the C-plot threads CONVERGE through shared tooling rather than through shared characters.

## 8. THE JOE/METHOS SCENE AS SERIES ARCHITECTURE

### Why This Is a Big Moment

The Joe/Methos private conversation is arguably the most important C-plot scene in Season 1 so far. Here's why:

1. **It releases pressure.** The deferred reunion has been building tension since 1x07 (three episodes). Audiences can feel deferred payoffs. Releasing it here, in the XML episode, is structurally correct — the episode about organizing relationships is where you acknowledge the most complicated relationship in the ensemble.

2. **It reframes Methos.** He's been the sardonic commentator — one line, perfectly placed, back to the pillar. This scene reveals that the detachment is effortful. He's been avoiding Joe because the conversation requires honesty, and Methos's five-thousand-year survival strategy is strategic dishonesty. Joe makes him honest.

3. **It authorizes Daniel's investigation.** Methos saying "He'll find what I found. But he'll understand it better" is the green light. Not explicit — Methos doesn't say "Go tell Daniel to dig deeper." But Joe will. And the audience knows it. The investigation's acceleration in the back half of the season is authorized here.

4. **The "happiest man in Alexandria" parable** is Methos at his storytelling best. The cataloguer who found "the thing that didn't end" — it's about Joe, it's about Pliny, it's about the entire XML/STML project. Organizing knowledge is the work that doesn't end. And in this episode, the tools to do it properly have arrived.

## 9. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR COMPILATION

1. **Joe/Methos scene length.** I've pitched 120-150 seconds — the longest C-plot beat in the season. Is this too long for a C-plot scene, or is the deferred payoff worth the screen time? Alternative: split it across two scenes (Joe/Methos meet in Act 3, the deeper conversation continues in Tag).

2. **Pliny/Casey faith beat — Salii comparison.** Pliny comparing the rosary to the Salii priests' ritual dance is historically grounded (the Salii were real) and tonally right (Pliny compares, doesn't evaluate). But does the character writer have a different angle on this beat? The season outline specifically asks for the patronage parallel; the Salii comparison is my addition.

3. **Carter's emotional-state experiment.** The thread appendix asks: "Does the frequency shift with Midas's emotional state?" I've answered yes (frequency shifts slightly, amplitude increases when agitated). Is this the right moment to reveal this, or should it be saved for 1x10? The risk: too many revelations in one episode. The benefit: the XML tools make the structured observation possible for the first time.

4. **Daniel's STML dossier — on-screen code.** Should Daniel's investigation XML be shown on screen in detail, or is a brief glimpse sufficient? The A-plot will already have significant on-screen code. Adding Daniel's investigation XML risks code-overload.

5. **Kirk stinger — "tree with no root."** Kirk's compartmentalized org chart is the dark-mirror version of XML's root-element structure. Is "HIERARCHIA" the right word? Alternatives: ORDO (order), ARBOR (tree — but that's the team's title word), STRUCTURA (structure). HIERARCHIA feels right because Kirk is specifically building a HIERARCHY of command, but it's also the most on-the-nose.

6. **O'Neill building his own XML dossier.** This shows O'Neill learning from the A-plot and applying it to intelligence work. Is this too much O'Neill for an episode that's already dense with Daniel/Pliny/Joe/Methos/Carter C-plot beats? Alternative: O'Neill's dossier is mentioned but not shown.

7. **The "happiest man in Alexandria" — is this a real Methos flashback or just a story he tells?** I've pitched it as a story (Joe and Methos at a table, Methos narrating). If the character writer wants a brief visual flashback (10-15 seconds, a man cataloguing scrolls in firelight), that could work too. But Methos telling stories > Methos in flashbacks, generally. The voice is the point.
