## A. STRUCTURAL DECISIONS

### Beat Count and Act Structure

**Recommendation: 25 beats** (matching 1x05's structure). Cold Open + 5 Acts + Tag + Stinger, with 4 C-Plot beats interwoven.

The **A-plot technical writer's act structure holds** with minor adjustments:

| Section | Beats | Content |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Cold Open | 1 | Carter's redundancy discovery (pre-dawn) |
| Act One: "Redundantia" | Beats 1-5 | The problem named. The linguists explain. Pointer equality. The naming. |
| Act Two: "Aedificare Super Fundamenta" | Beats 6-10 | Dependency chain. Core implementation. Borg parallel. Carter's answer. Global singleton. |
| Act Three: "Probatio" | Beats 11-14 | Interning the census. Pointer comparison. Teal'c's test. Vocabulary statistics. |
| Act Four: "Methos Meminit" | Beats 15-16 | Methos/Alexandria revelation. Data/Midas friendship. |
| Act Five: "Unum Pro Omnibus" | Beats 17-19 | Interned census live. Pliny's encyclopedia interned. Title moment. |
| Tag | Beats 20-21 | Carter/Marcus evening walk. Methos closing. |
| Stinger | Beat 22 | Kirk's "LEXICON" scene |
| C-Plot | Beats C1-C4 | Kirk acquisitions. Compass. Duncan's pattern. Data's eyes. |

**Adjustment from A-plot pitch:** The A-plot writer places the Methos/Alexandria scene in Act Four as a standalone act. This is correct — it gives the emotional center of the episode room to breathe, separated from the technical implementation (Acts 1-3) and the payoff (Act 5). The character writer's suggestion of "Act Two or early Act Three" for the Methos revelation is overruled — it needs the weight of its own act, especially with the flashback flash.

**Tag adjustment:** The A-plot writer gives Tag only to Carter/Marcus (Beat 20). I recommend ADDING a brief Methos closing beat (Beat 21) before the stinger — see Section C below.

---

## B. CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### Conflict 1: Methos/Alexandria — Who Triggers It?

**A-plot writer:** Methos raises the Borg parallel himself during the implementation discussion (Beat 8), then the Alexandria revelation follows naturally in Act 4 (Beat 15) when Daniel is working alone.

**Character writer:** Daniel and Lucia are explaining canonical forms. Daniel mentions Alexandria. Methos slips into first-person tense ("They didn't just choose. They *destroyed* the variants."). Daniel catches the tense-shift.

**Thread writer:** Similar to character writer. The conversation about empires imposing canonical language leads Daniel to push: "You were in Alexandria." Not a question.

**DECISION: Use the character writer's version for the TRIGGER, but the A-plot writer's placement.** Reason: The tense-slip is dramatically superior to Methos voluntarily raising it. The character writer gives us "They." → "You said 'they.'" → "You weren't reading. You were *remembering.*" This is Daniel at his best — the archaeologist who identifies primary sources. But place this in **Act Four** (not Act Two), after the Borg discussion has given the audience the philosophical framework. The Borg parallel in Act Two makes the audience THINK about assimilation as metaphor. The Alexandria revelation in Act Four makes them realize Methos has SEEN it as reality.

**Specific sequence:**
1. Beat 8 (Act Two): Methos raises the Borg parallel himself ("You know who else does this.") — use A-plot writer's version
2. Beat 15 (Act Four): Daniel working in the archive. Methos enters. The tense-slip happens. — use character writer's dialogue with thread writer's Daniel push ("You were in Alexandria." Not a question.)

### Conflict 2: The Alexandria Revelation — How Much Detail?

**A-plot writer:** Methos mentions Alexandria, the sub-chamber, cults, "a priestess," "artifacts, stones," then deflects. Daniel writes in his notebook.

**Character writer:** Much more detail. Methos describes the Ptolemaic confiscation policy ("They confiscated every scroll... returned the copies and kept the originals"). Describes the sub-chamber explicitly. Mentions the stone ("Black. Dense. Warm to the touch even in winter"). The priestess. The synchronized behavior. The word "assimilation." Then catches himself.

**Thread writer:** Mid-detail. Methos describes the sub-chamber, mentions "cults that made people different," then the mask returns. Daniel notices the deflection.

**Historian:** Provides grounding for the confiscation policy (Ptolemy III Euergetes, Galen as source), the Serapeum underground chambers (Rufinus), and the Cybele presence in Alexandria.

**DECISION: Use the character writer's FULL version** with one critical edit. The character writer's scene is the most dramatically rich — the tense-slip, the cascading detail about the sub-chamber, the stone description, the word "assimilation." This is the first major crack in Methos's armor and it should be substantial enough that the audience FEELS the weight of five thousand years surfacing.

**THE EDIT:** Cut the line where Methos explicitly says "Assimilation." The character writer has: Daniel asks "What did you call it?" and Methos answers "Assimilation." This is TOO explicit — it makes the Borg parallel a direct statement rather than letting the audience connect it themselves. Instead, have Methos catch himself BEFORE the word: "I called it something—" *(stops, sets down the wine cup, changes the subject)*. The audience who just heard the Borg discussion in Act Two will fill in the word themselves. This is the Nightcrawler approach applied to the Borg thread.

**Include the historian's grounding** — use the Ptolemaic confiscation policy as Methos's opening example of "interning" at Alexandria, which naturally leads to the deeper memories.

### Conflict 3: The 10-15 Second Flash vs. No Flashback

**Character writer:** Advocates for a 10-15 second "flash" — torchlit sub-chamber, priestess with kohled eyes, the black stone on a pedestal absorbing light, synchronized figures, young Methos watching from behind a column, stone pulses, priestess turns toward him, SMASH CUT back.

**Character writer also asks (Open Question #2):** Should there be a parallel brief Midas flash during the Data/Midas "uninternable" scene?

**DECISION: Include Methos's flash. NO Midas flash.** The Methos flash (10-15 sec) is earned — it comes at the exact moment in the dialogue when Methos describes the stone, and it gives the audience a visual anchor for the sub-chamber that will pay off in 1x17. It's also a different register than 1x04's Duncan flashback (2-3 min) and 1x05's Pliny flashback (60-90 sec). The brevity scale: 1x04 > 1x05 > 1x06. The flashbacks are getting shorter, which suggests each is more potent.

No Midas flash because: (a) it would crowd the episode with two flashbacks in one act; (b) the Midas/Phrygia story is for 2x13; (c) Midas's mystery is better served by inference (the audience connects the stones themselves); (d) the Data/Midas "uninternable" scene is warm and intimate and a flashback would break its tone.

### Conflict 4: The Data/Midas Friendship Scene — Which Version?

**A-plot writer (Beat 16):** Botanical specimens. Rosa canina. "Names should be shared. People should not." Data: "Philosophically consistent in a way I find unusual among biological organisms." Midas: "You are the most honest person I have ever met." — Warm, simple, about classification.

**Character writer (Section 3):** Two-part scene. Part 1 — Walking the colony. Midas describes Tertia Valeria's garden. Data: "You cannot be interned." Midas: "That's an odd way to be told you're alone." Data: "I was not telling you that you are alone. I was telling you that you are *original*." Part 2 (callback) — Data returns: "Friendship is what you use when interning is impossible." — Deeply philosophical, about uniqueness and verification.

**Genre fan:** Data should say something about finding interning "enviable" and Midas responds "I think you are your own canonical copy." — Warm but less developed.

**DECISION: Use the character writer's TWO-PART version as the primary Data/Midas scene.** It's dramatically richer, philosophically deeper, and does more work for the series arc (the self-verification question, the "uninternable" concept, the 2x11-13 setup). The A-plot writer's botanical specimens version is cut as a standalone scene — BUT the Rosa canina detail can be folded in as context (they're cataloging specimens when Data makes the observation, giving them an activity during the conversation).

**Placement:** Part 1 (the "uninternable" scene) in **Beat 16, simultaneous with Beat 15** (Methos/Alexandria). The parallel structure — two deeply personal scenes happening at the same time in different rooms — gives Act Four its emotional architecture. Part 2 (the callback — "friendship is external verification") in **late Act Five or early Tag**, after the technical work is done.

### Conflict 5: The Borg/Interning Parallel — Who Delivers It?

**A-plot writer:** Methos raises the Borg parallel. Carter answers. Data provides the precise distinction ("The distinction is precise. Interning operates on the *name*, not the *named*.") Methos has the closing line: "The Borg share identity. You share vocabulary. That's a thinner line than you think."

**Thread writer:** Similar to A-plot, but gives Casey a brief line: "One for all isn't the same as all for one."

**Genre fan:** Wants Data to connect it explicitly to Picard/Best of Both Worlds.

**DECISION: Use the A-plot writer's version with the thread writer's Casey line added.** The A-plot writer's scene (Beats 8-9) is the strongest dramatically. Methos raises it, Carter thinks carefully, Data provides the philosophical precision, Methos delivers the closing warning. ADD Casey's line ("One for all isn't the same as all for one") as the beat's final word — it's a one-line summary of the whole episode spoken by the man whose crucifix is in frame. It also half-quotes the Musketeers motto, which the thread writer notes.

**CUT the genre fan's explicit Picard/Best of Both Worlds reference.** Data should NOT say "This is the inverse of what happened to Captain Picard." The resonance should be implicit. The audience will hear it. Data doesn't need to spell it out.

### Conflict 6: The Cross-Franchise Algorithm Moment (Three Voices)

**Genre fan proposes three voices:**
1. **Methos:** 47 names, one canonical identity, "Your machine does in microseconds what took me five thousand years to manage badly"
2. **Data:** Memoization, O(n) to O(1), "transforms the nature of the operation from examination to recognition"
3. **Casey:** Grandfather's one Bible, family annotations, "everyone points to it... they all share the conversation"

**A-plot writer:** Doesn't propose a specific three-voice moment. The interning explanation is distributed across Carter, Daniel, Lucia, Data, and Pliny in Acts 1-2.

**DECISION: Use the genre fan's three-voice moment, but trim it and place it carefully.** The 1x05 three-voice moment (Pliny/Data/Casey explaining hashing) worked because it was a single focused beat. This should be similar.

**Placement:** During **Beat 7** (after the core implementation is on screen). Carter has just shown the code. Now three characters explain what it MEANS through their own lens. Keep each contribution to 3-4 lines max. The genre fan's versions are too long — trim:
- Methos: Keep "47 names" and "your machine does in microseconds." Cut the middle elaboration.
- Data: Keep "from examination to recognition." Cut the formal definition.
- Casey: Keep the grandfather's Bible. This is gold. Every word stays.

### Conflict 7: The Kirk Stinger — Which Version?

**A-plot writer (Beat 21):** Video call with six faces showing functional designations (NORTHWEST-INFRA-7, etc). Kirk addresses by function. After the call, he consolidates duplicate operatives in a database. Types a note using the word "canonical." Says "Unum pro omnibus" to himself.

**Thread writer (Section 2):** Conference room in a real office building. Glass walls. Frosted corporate name. Kirk reads from a *style guide* — canonical phrases ("leadership opportunity" not "career change"). Explains that standardized language enables searchability/monitoring. Writes "LEXICON" on whiteboard. Adds "6/31." Camera pulls back through glass wall to reveal identical buildings.

**Genre fan (Section 5):** Protocol document. Two whiteboards. Kirk says "There is no deviation. There is the protocol." Writes "FORMA CANONICA" on the protocol. Writes "UNUM PRO OMNIBUS."

**DECISION: Use the thread writer's version as the base, with elements from the A-plot writer.** The thread writer's scene is the strongest because:
1. The STYLE GUIDE is a perfect mirror of interning — canonical phrases, not canonical strings
2. The searchability rationale ("if someone uses the phrase, they're ours") is chilling and technically precise
3. "LEXICON" continues the series (TABULARIUM → LEXICON)
4. The pull-back through identical glass buildings is a great visual

**Add from the A-plot writer:** Kirk should use the word "canonical" and the phrase "Unum pro omnibus" (either spoken or written). The thread writer has "LEXICON" on the whiteboard. Add "6/31" from the thread writer. Kirk says "Unum pro omnibus" to close — the A-plot writer's ending.

**Cut from the genre fan:** "FORMA CANONICA" on the protocol and "UNUM PRO OMNIBUS" on the whiteboard are redundant with the spoken version. The genre fan's "There is no deviation. There is the protocol." is too Borg-literal. Kirk should be smoother than that.

**Final stinger structure:**
- Real office building, glass walls, corporate name ("Synthesis Dynamics" or similar)
- Kirk reading from style guide: canonical phrases for all communications
- "LEXICON" on whiteboard. "6/31."
- Kirk explains: standardized language enables monitoring/searchability
- Closes laptop: "Unum pro omnibus."
- Camera pulls back through glass.
- SMASH TO BLACK.

### Conflict 8: Daniel Pushing Methos — One Beat or Two?

**Character writer (Open Question #1):** Should Daniel make a second attempt to return to the subject later in the episode, which Methos shuts down harder?

**DECISION: ONE beat only.** Daniel pushes in Act Four. Methos deflects. Daniel files it. A second push would dilute the impact of the deflection and make Methos look less formidable. Daniel is an archaeologist — he's patient. He pulls threads over episodes, not within a single episode. Let the audience see Daniel write in his notebook and KNOW he'll be back. That's more powerful than seeing him try again the same day.

### Conflict 9: Teal'c's Test — Immutability vs. Case Sensitivity

**A-plot writer (Beat 13):** Teal'c tests immutability. He interns a string, modifies the original, re-interns the modified version. The table returns the OLD canonical copy. The concern: someone will modify a local copy and expect the canonical version to reflect the change. Data: "If one voice changes the canonical word, every reference is changed without consent." Teal'c: "The canonical copy is a *treaty*."

**Character writer (Section 6):** Teal'c tests case sensitivity. 'CINNABAR' and 'cinnabar' produce different canonical copies. "A freed slave and a free citizen have different legal status but are the same person."

**DECISION: Use the A-plot writer's IMMUTABILITY test as the main Beat 13.** It connects directly to the Borg/assimilation theme (mutable canonical = assimilation) and delivers the episode's deepest philosophical point: immutability is the price of sharing. Teal'c's "the canonical copy is a treaty" is one of the best lines in the episode.

**Fold the character writer's case-sensitivity observation** into a brief line in the test montage (early Beat 13, before the immutability discovery): Teal'c notes the case issue, Carter confirms it's by design, and Teal'c files it — seeds future discussion without competing with the immutability beat.

### Conflict 10: The Naming Scene — "Internamentum"

**A-plot writer (Beat 5):** Daniel proposes "Internare?" Lucia refines to "Internamentum." Lucia writes on the board: "Internamentum: Locus ubi unum pro omnibus conservatur." Pliny reads and approves.

**Character writer (Section 4):** Lucia explains she's been interning since she was twelve. Daniel: "We need a Latin name for the process." Lucia: "The process has a Latin name. *Internare.*"

**Historian (Part 6):** Daniel needs a word. Lucia: "*Internare.* To place within." Daniel: "*Internamentum.*" Pliny objects: "We already have a word. *Exemplar.*" Lucia: "Then the internamentum is the *theca exemplarium.*" Pliny: "I prefer *internamentum*. It implies the act of placing something inside a secure space."

**DECISION: Use the historian's version, which is the richest.** It includes all three voices (Daniel proposing the derivation, Lucia providing the root, Pliny objecting with "exemplar" and then being persuaded). The historian's version gives Pliny a role in the naming scene he doesn't have in the other versions, and the *exemplar* vs. *internamentum* debate is linguistically substantive.

**BUT:** End with Lucia's board-writing from the A-plot writer: "*Internamentum: Locus ubi unum pro omnibus conservatur.*" This is the beat's landing. Pliny reads it and says "Unum pro omnibus." Carter echoes. Hard cut to the board.

**Who:** Carter, Marcus, Data, Pliny.
**Placement:** Act Two, Beat 6.

### Scene 7: Core Implementation + Three Voices (Beat 7)

**Use A-plot writer for the code walkthrough.** Carter codes, walks through `chorda_internare()`. Marcus's question ("the first citizen's word?") and Carter's correction ("not the first citizen's word — the *canonical* word").

**Then the three-voice moment** (genre fan's trimmed version): Methos (47 names), Data (examination to recognition), Casey (grandfather's Bible).

**Who:** Carter coding. Marcus questioning. Then Methos, Data, Casey for the three-voice beat.
**Placement:** Act Two, Beat 7.

**Use A-plot writer's immutability test** with character writer's case-sensitivity as brief preamble.
See Conflict 9 above.

**Who:** Teal'c presenting, Carter responding, Data confirming ("Assimilation. If one voice changes the canonical word...").
**Placement:** Act Three, Beat 13.

### Scene 12: The Vocabulary of a Civilization (Beat 14)

**Use A-plot writer.** The statistics: 1,466 canonical words. Pliny: "The vocabulary of a civilization." Daniel: "A finite vocabulary arranged in infinite combinations." Pliny: "The Internamentum is the periodic table."

**Who:** Carter, Pliny, Daniel.
**Placement:** Act Three, Beat 14. ACT BREAK.

### Scene 13: Methos/Alexandria Revelation (Beat 15)

**Use character writer's trigger** (tense-slip, Daniel catches it) + **character writer's dialogue** for the full scene + **character writer's flash** (10-15 sec). Cut explicit "Assimilation" — have Methos catch himself before the word.

Include historian's Ptolemaic confiscation policy as Methos's opening historical frame before the personal memory surfaces.

**Who:** Methos and Daniel, alone.
**Placement:** Act Four, Beat 15.

### Scene 14: Data/Midas — "The Uninternable" (Beat 16)

**Use character writer's two-part version.** Part 1 here (simultaneous with Beat 15). Part 2 callback in Tag.

Activity: they're cataloging botanical specimens (A-plot writer's Rosa canina as setting detail). Data: "You cannot be interned." The full "original, not alone" exchange. "Two uninternable things, walking together." The self-verification question. "How do you know you haven't drifted?"

**Who:** Data and Midas, alone.
**Placement:** Act Four, Beat 16 (simultaneous with Beat 15).

### Scene 15: The Interned Census Live (Beat 17)

**Use A-plot writer.** The query demonstration. Pointer comparisons. "That query took four minutes yesterday." Marcus: "Every Roman magistrate who has ever waited for a census query will understand this improvement."

**Who:** Carter, Marcus, a citizen. Full team observing.
**Placement:** Act Five, Beat 17.

### Scene 16: Pliny's Encyclopedia Interned (Beat 18)

**Who:** Pliny and Carter.
**Placement:** Act Five, Beat 18.

### Scene 17: The Title Moment (Beat 19)

**Use A-plot writer** with character writer's ensemble dynamics. The final statistics on the board. Lucia summarizing the dependency chain. Marcus's aqueduct metaphor. Pliny's dedication: "Unum pro omnibus, non omnes pro uno."

**Who:** Full team gathered.
**Placement:** Act Five, Beat 19.

### Scene 18: Tag — Carter/Marcus Walk (Beat 20)

**Use A-plot writer.** Their ritual walk. Marcus: "Can any be removed?" Carter: "No." Marcus: "Then you have built something Roman." Carter: "Next, we need to save things to disk." Marcus: "File I/O." The 1x07 tease.

**Who:** Carter and Marcus.
**Placement:** Tag, Beat 20.

### Scene 19: Tag — Data/Midas Callback + Methos (Beat 21)

**NEW BEAT — not in any single pitch but compiled from character writer and A-plot writer.**

Two sub-beats:
1. Data returns to Midas. "Friendship is what you use when interning is impossible." Midas: "Then I'm glad I know you, Data." (Character writer's callback.) — 45 seconds.
2. Methos alone in the archive, post-conversation with Daniel. Pouring wine. Looking at the interned data on screen. A quiet moment of the man who remembers everything he's told Daniel — and everything he hasn't. He touches the screen where the word "canonica" appears. His hand lingers. He drinks. — 30 seconds, no dialogue. The silence IS the statement.

**Who:** Data/Midas (sub-beat 1). Methos alone (sub-beat 2).
**Placement:** Tag, Beat 21.

### Scene 20: Stinger — Kirk's LEXICON (Beat 22)

**Use thread writer's version** with A-plot writer's "Unum pro omnibus" closing.
See Conflict 7 above.

**Who:** Kirk, aide(s).
**Placement:** Stinger, Beat 22.

## D. WHAT TO INCLUDE FROM EACH PITCH

### From the Technical/A-Plot Writer:

**KEEP:**
- The complete act structure and pacing (it's strong and well-balanced)
- ALL on-screen code moments (8 code blocks — these are essential)
- The cold open redundancy discovery
- The pointer equality explanation (content vs. identity — Beat 4)
- The dependency chain as structural landmark (Beat 6)
- The core `chorda_internare()` code walkthrough (Beat 7)
- The Borg parallel scene structure (Beats 8-9)
- The global singleton scene (Beat 10)
- The census interning montage and memory visualization (Beat 11)
- The pointer comparison demonstration (Beat 12)
- Teal'c's immutability test (Beat 13)
- The "vocabulary of a civilization" statistics (Beat 14)
- The interned census live demonstration (Beat 17)
- Pliny's encyclopedia interning and auto-cross-references (Beat 18)
- The title moment and Pliny's dedication (Beat 19)
- The Carter/Marcus evening walk (Beat 20)
- The mirror structure analysis (problem → Borg naming → working through → dark mirror)
- The stinger's use of functional designations and "canonical"

**CUT:**
- Nothing major. This is the backbone of the episode.

### From the Character Writer:

**KEEP:**
- Methos's tense-slip trigger mechanism ("They" → Daniel catches it)
- The full Alexandria revelation scene with escalating detail
- The 10-15 second Methos flash (sub-chamber, priestess, stone, young Methos)
- The Data/Midas two-part "uninternable" scene (the best B-plot material)
- "Friendship is what you use when interning is impossible" (callback)
- Midas's self-verification question ("How do you know you haven't drifted?")
- Carter's fatigue moment with Casey ("I wish intelligence worked that way. One truth, shared with everyone." / "What truth are you carrying?" / "Too many.")
- Casey's faith thread RESTING — correct analysis, crucifix in frame only
- Performance note: Peter Wingfield "Comes a Horseman" register for the revelation
- Open Question resolution: ONE push from Daniel (no second attempt)

**CUT:**
- The character writer's proposed placement (Act Two/Three) for the Alexandria scene — moved to Act Four
- The "What happened to Lorenzo?" Duncan/O'Neill exchange — this duplicates the C-plot thread writer's version and the thread version is better placed
- The Midas flash (character writer's Open Question #2) — too crowded with the Methos flash

### From the Thread Writer:

**KEEP:**
- The Casey escalation table (updated through 1x06 — crucifix in frame, no dialogue)
- The Kirk stinger scene as primary version (style guide, "LEXICON," searchability rationale, glass-wall pullback)
- The Kirk progression table (seed → germination → root → branches → organization → standardization)
- The 4 C-Plot beats:
  - C1: Kirk acquisitions (Portland, Denver, Boise) — use thread writer's dialogue
  - C2: Compass update (oscillating pattern, variable amplitude, second instrument)
  - C3: Duncan recognizes Kirk's pattern ("He's not indexing anymore. He's *standardizing*.")
  - C4: Data's eye-color beat with Midas
- The nominalism/realism analysis (interning = deepest realism yet)
- Casey's one-line contribution to the Borg scene: "One for all isn't the same as all for one"
- The Musketeers half-motto observation (only using first half of "unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno")
- The three-column comparison table (Team / Kirk / Borg)
- The full Thread Status Appendix — include at end of beat sheet
- The backward/forward connections — include in continuity notes

**CUT:**
- The thread writer's version of the Methos/Alexandria scene — superseded by character writer's more detailed version
- The thread writer's version of Daniel's push — superseded by character writer's tense-slip
- The temporal clock drift anomaly (sundial vs. laptop) — this is interesting but overstuffs the C-plot. Keep compass-only for 1x06. The clock drift can seed in 1x07 or 1x08 naturally.

### From the Genre Fan:

**KEEP:**
- The three-voice cross-franchise algorithm moment (Methos/Data/Casey — trimmed)
- Casey's grandfather's Bible speech — this is the genre fan's best contribution, every word stays
- The inversion analysis: Borg interning is LOSSY (keeps function, discards nature); our interning is LOSSLESS (full transcription)
- The Hugh parallel (de-assimilation as reverse interning) — for thematic notes, not dramatized
- The Seven of Nine analysis (new canonical version, not restoration) — for thematic notes
- The "Darmok" warning (private interning is meaningless; canonical must be shared) — for thematic notes
- The observation about the singleton pattern ("it practices what it preaches") — for thematic notes
- Data's 10-second silence during the interning demo (the Lal resonance — "the string that cannot be interned") — this is a DIRECTION NOTE, not dialogue
- "Resistance is futile" inversion possibility — defer this, too cute for this episode
- The number 47 — if it lands naturally. Don't force it.
- BSG "all this has happened before" as anti-interning — for thematic notes

**CUT:**
- The extended Borg architecture analysis (Section 9: key vs. value ontology, Borg Queen as singleton) — this is smart criticism but too inside-baseball for the beat sheet. Save for series bible.
- The Foundation/B5/DS9/Hitchhiker deep connections — most are too elaborate for the beat sheet. Keep Foundation/Seldon note. Cut B5, DS9 Prophets, Total Perspective Vortex.
- The "Inner Light" / "Data as living internamentum" scene — the genre fan proposes Casey saying "You're not redundant, Data. You're backed up." This is cute but doesn't earn its place. Cut.
- The Joe Dawson Watcher Chronicles as anti-internamentum — clever but not dramatizable. Bible note.
- "FORMA CANONICA" and "UNUM PRO OMNIBUS" on Kirk's whiteboard — redundant with spoken version.
- "There is no deviation. There is the protocol." — too Borg-literal for Kirk.

### From the Historian:

**KEEP:**
- The Ptolemaic ship-search policy detail for Methos's Alexandria scene (Galen source, "ek ploion" labels)
- The Serapeum underground chambers (Rufinus) as grounding for the sub-chamber
- Cybele cult in Alexandria — historically attested (Metroon, syncretic religion, mystery initiations)
- The Galli description — NOT for dramatization in 1x06, but the beat sheet should note this for 1x17
- The naming scene dialogue (Daniel/Lucia/Pliny three-way with "exemplar" debate)
- Key Latin terminology: canonica, exemplar, communis, idem, par → identitas
- The Twelve Tables as interning precedent (for Marcus's dialogue — "One law for all citizens")
- The aquila as canonical reference (for Marcus — potential brief mention)
- Production design notes for the Methos flash (Mouseion district, Serapeum sub-chambers, sound design)
- Zenodotus → Aristophanes → Aristarchus chain as the first textual interning project (for Daniel's dialogue)
- Latin as canonical language (dead = immutable = interned forever) — for thematic notes
- The ethical question of canonicalization (who decides what's canonical?) — echoes O'Neill's 1x05 "Who chose the math?"
- The Septuagint legend — for Casey resonance in thematic notes (NOT dramatized)

**CUT:**
- The full Vulgate section — too much for this episode. The Septuagint mention is sufficient.
- The Res Gestae distributed copies — save for 1x15 (networking/backup).
- The Roman measurement standards section — interesting but already covered by Marcus's existing metaphors.
- The Lex Coloniae — defer to a future governance episode.
- The taurobolium description — 1x17 material, not 1x06.
- Detailed production design for a FULL Alexandria flashback — we're doing a 10-15 sec flash, not a full scene.
- The bibliography appendix — save for series bible, not beat sheet.

## E. WHAT TO CUT OR DEFER

### Cut (Too Dense for One Episode):
- Second Daniel push on Methos (character writer's Open Question #1)
- Midas flash/flashback (character writer's Open Question #2)
- Clock drift / sundial anomaly (thread writer C2 detail) — move to 1x07-08
- Extended Borg architecture analysis (genre fan Section 9)
- B5/DS9/Hitchhiker deep genre connections (genre fan Section 4)
- "Data as living internamentum" / Casey: "You're backed up" scene (genre fan)
- Vulgate, Res Gestae, Roman standards, Lex Coloniae (historian)
- Taurobolium and detailed Galli rites (historian — for 1x17)
- Full Alexandria production design (historian — for 1x17)

### Defer to Series Bible / Thematic Notes (Interesting but Not Dramatized):
- Hugh as reverse-interning (genre fan) — thematic notes
- Seven of Nine's "new canonical version" (genre fan) — thematic notes
- "Darmok" warning about private interning (genre fan) — thematic notes
- The singleton as self-referential principle (genre fan) — thematic notes
- BSG "all this has happened before" (genre fan) — thematic notes
- Foundation Second Crisis (genre fan) — thematic notes
- Borg Queen as corrupted singleton (genre fan) — series bible
- Latin as immutable canonical language (historian) — thematic notes
- Septuagint as miracle of canonical agreement (historian) — thematic notes
- The ethical question of canonicalization (historian) — seed in O'Neill's silence, develop in S3

## F. TITLE RESONANCE

### How Many Layers to Surface?

The thread writer identifies three readings. The genre fan adds the Musketeers. The historian adds the aquila and the sacrificial tradition.

**DECISION: Surface THREE layers. Imply the fourth.**

1. **Technical (stated explicitly):** One canonical copy for all references. This is the A-plot. Said many times by many characters.

2. **Borg (stated explicitly by Methos):** "Unum pro omnibus" = one consciousness for all drones. Methos names this. The distinction is dramatized. Kirk echoes it in the stinger.

3. **Theological (visual only — Nightcrawler approach):** The crucifix is in frame during the "canonical" discussion. Casey says nothing about it. The audience connects "one for all" to "a man who died for everyone" (1x05) on their own. The thread writer's analysis is correct: the signal is zero, the resonance is entirely in the viewer's mind.

4. **Musketeers (implied by absence):** The show uses only the first half of "unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno." The second half is the Borg version. This is noted in thematic notes but NOT stated by any character. The Dumas-literate audience catches it.

**What is NOT stated:** Nobody says "this is like the Musketeers." Nobody says "this is like the Cross." Nobody says "this is like the aquila." The title does the work. The audience adds layers on rewatch. This is by design.

## G. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

### 1. Carter's Fatigue Beat — Where Does It Land?

The character writer proposes Carter almost confiding in Casey: "I wish intelligence worked that way. One truth, shared with everyone." / "What truth are you carrying?" / "Too many." This is a good beat — it shows the weight of Carter carrying the compass data, the Midas temporal file, the growing secret burden. But where does it go without disrupting flow?

**My recommendation:** During the census interning montage (Beat 11), as a brief two-line exchange. Carter is coding, Casey brings her coffee, the moment happens, they return to work. It's small enough not to slow the montage but plants the seed that Carter's secret-keeping is accumulating.

**Fran to confirm or adjust.**

### 2. Data's Slot Number 47

The genre fan and the 1x05 beat sheet both mention this Easter egg. If Data's entry in the interning table resolves to the 47th canonical entry, it's a deep Trek cut.

**My recommendation:** Include it as a one-frame visual during the census interning montage (Beat 11). When Data's name scrolls by on the screen, the counter reads "XLVII." Not called out. Freeze-frame gold. Low cost, high reward.

**Fran to confirm.**

### 3. O'Neill's Presence in This Episode

O'Neill is relatively quiet in 1x06 (compared to his "Who chose the math?" spotlight in 1x05). His contributions:
- "You're saying we're building Borg tech" (Beat 8) — the O'Neill instinct
- "One table. One point of failure." (Beat 10) — the strategic mind
- C-plot with Duncan (Beats C1, C3)

Is this enough? The A-plot writer gives him more (the Beat 10 exit is strong). The character writer gives him nothing specific. The thread writer has him in the C-plot.

**My recommendation:** This is sufficient. O'Neill's two lines in the main plot (Borg objection, singleton risk) are both load-bearing. His C-plot presence with Duncan tracks Kirk's growth. He doesn't need more. Not every character needs a spotlight every episode.

**Fran to confirm.**

### 4. Casey Faith Beat — Confirm the Rest

All five writers agree: the faith thread rests in 1x06. The crucifix is in frame during the canonical discussion. No dialogue. The escalation table (thread writer) is correct.

The only addition is Casey's grandfather's Bible speech in the three-voice moment (genre fan). This is not a "faith beat" per se — it's a personal memory that reveals Casey's relationship with shared canonical texts. It rhymes with faith without being about faith.

**My recommendation:** Include the Bible speech. It's organic, it's the three-voice moment, and it doesn't break the rest. The thread writer's escalation table still holds because the speech isn't about Catholicism — it's about a family sharing one book.

**Fran to confirm.**

### 5. Methos's Closing Beat in the Tag

The A-plot writer doesn't include a Methos beat in the Tag. I've added one (Beat 21, sub-beat 2) — Methos alone, touching the screen, no dialogue. This gives the audience a final image of the man who just cracked open his armor, alone with the weight of what he revealed. It also mirrors 1x05's tag (Methos's fire warning).

**My recommendation:** Include. 30 seconds. No dialogue. The silence is earned.

**Fran to confirm or cut.**
