# NOVUM FUNDAMENTUM
## Episode 1x07: "Tabulae Ceratae" (Wax Tablets)
### COMPILATION PLAN — Decisions Document

---

## A. STRUCTURAL DECISIONS

### Beat Count and Act Structure

**Recommendation: 22 beats** (Cold Open + 5 Acts + Tag + Stinger, with 4 C-Plot beats interwoven).

The A-plot technical writer's act structure is strong and well-paced. The five acts map to the episode's progression cleanly:

| Section | Beats | Content |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Cold Open | 1 | Power fluctuation. Data loss. Carter sees zero. "TABULAE CERATAE." |
| Act One: "Cera et Lapis" | Beats 1-4 | The loss understood. Marcus's wax/stone metaphor. Carter's blueprint. Dependency chain grows. |
| Act Two: "Scribere" | Beats 5-8 | First write. Streaming writer. The sync moment. Overwrite vs. append. |
| Act Three: "Legere" | Beats 9-12 | First read. Streaming reader. Census + encyclopedia saved. Teal'c tests error handling. |
| Act Four: "Conservare" | Beats 13-16 | Joe arrives. Joe/Pliny scene. Joe's leaky-roof story. Vocabulary saved. |
| Act Five: "Quod Scribitur, Manet" | Beats 17-19 | Reload test. Teal'c's test suite. Title moment. |
| Tag | Beats 20-21 | Carter/Marcus walk. Pliny/Joe evening. |
| Stinger | Beat 22 | Kirk's persistence stinger. |
| C-Plot | Beats C1-C4 | Joe/O'Neill briefing. Carter saves temporal data. Casey's grace + O'Neill's "Huh." Daniel/Joe Methos file. |

**Key structural adjustment:** The A-plot writer places Joe's arrival in Act Four (Beat 13). This is correct — the first three acts should focus on the TECHNICAL build (write, sync, read, save), and Joe's arrival marks the emotional pivot. The episode's first half is about HOW to persist. The second half is about WHY.

## B. CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### Conflict 1: Kirk Stinger — Three Different Versions

**A-plot pitch:** Physical filing cabinets. Metal drawers. Manila folders. MACLEOD, D. dossier. "Digital for operations. Paper for secrets." Writes TABULARIUM. 7/31.

**Threads pitch:** Server room with rack-mounted drives. Digital backup. "I don't build in memory." Writes ARCHIVUM. 7/31.

**Genre pitch:** Terminal with digital files organized by city. Opens new file: COMMENTARII RETIS (Network Commentary = Captain's Log inverted). "The record is the network." 7/31.

**DECISION: Use the A-plot writer's version as the base, with the threads writer's ARCHIVUM and one element from the genre fan.** Reasoning:

1. The **physical filing cabinets** are dramatically the strongest because they INVERT the team's achievement. The team just learned to go FROM analog TO digital. Kirk is maintaining analog records BECAUSE digital is vulnerable. Same persistence instinct, opposite security model. This is the sharpest mirror the episode can produce.

2. The MACLEOD, D. dossier is a bombshell visual that earns its beat. Kirk having a physical file on Duncan — with photographs, printed emails, handwritten notes — tells the audience Kirk's intelligence operation is deeper than the team knows. It's a gut-punch for Highlander fans.

3. **ARCHIVUM** (threads writer) is the better whiteboard word than TABULARIUM. TABULARIUM already appeared in 1x05 — repeating it is thematic but also repetitive. ARCHIVUM is a new word that specifically means "archive" and mirrors the team's new capability. Kirk stinger progression: TABULARIUM → LEXICON → ARCHIVUM. Each word represents an escalation: indexing → standardizing → persisting.

4. From the genre fan: Kirk should say something that echoes TOS Kirk's logging habit, connecting his record-keeping to who he WAS. Add one line: "Everything filed. Everything recoverable." This echoes the Captain's Log compulsion without being explicit. CUT the full COMMENTARII RETIS concept — it's too on-the-nose for Kirk at this stage. Kirk's Borg-compromised nature should remain subtext.

5. The A-plot writer's closing line — "What is written, remains" — is perfect because Marcus says the same thing in Act Five. Same principle. Same Latin phrase. Opposite purpose. KEEP.

**Final stinger structure:**
- Synthesis Dynamics office (established 1x06). Expanded. Kirk alone.
- Wall of physical filing cabinets. Metal drawers. Manila folders.
- Aide asks about the physical files. Kirk: "Digital for operations. Paper for secrets."
- Opens MACLEOD, D. dossier. Photos, emails, notes. Returns it.
- Opens NOVA ROMA — GATE ACCESS folder.
- "Seven cities, thirty-one operatives. Everything filed. Everything recoverable."
- Writes on whiteboard: **7 / 31**
- Below it: **ARCHIVUM**
- "What is written, remains."
- Closes cabinet. Locks it. Camera holds on the lock.
- SMASH TO BLACK.

**Kirk stinger progression updated:** seed → germination → root → branches → organization → standardization → **persistence**. TABULARIUM → LEXICON → ARCHIVUM.

### Conflict 2: Joe Dawson's Arrival — Gate vs. Road

**A-plot pitch:** Joe walks up the ROAD to Nova Roma. Limping, cane, leather bag. Duncan sees him first.

**Character pitch:** Joe comes through the GATE with Earth personnel. Last through. Sees Duncan. "You could've mentioned the Romans."

**Threads pitch:** Joe comes through the GATE. O'Neill meets him. Wary/testing dynamic.

**DECISION: Use the GATE arrival (3-to-1), but steal the A-plot's cinematic WALKING approach for Joe's physical entrance.** Here's the synthesis:

Joe comes through the gate with a small group of Earth personnel. He's the last one through — he pauses at the event horizon (character writer's detail, showing the man crossing a threshold). On the other side, the camera catches him WALKING — the limp, the cane, the guitar case on his back, the leather satchel. He takes in Nova Roma. The walking visual is preserved even though the arrival point is the gate.

First interaction: **Duncan.** The character writer's dialogue wins: "You could've mentioned the Romans." / "I did mention the Romans." / "You said 'a colony.' You said 'some locals.'" This is warmer and more character-specific than the threads writer's O'Neill-first version.

**BUT:** O'Neill should be present. He pulls Joe aside shortly after (this becomes C-Plot Beat C1 — see the threads writer's version). The dynamic: Duncan vouches, O'Neill is wary, Joe is charming. This establishes the triangle.

**CUT:** The A-plot writer's "He followed the trail through the Stargate" line. Joe doesn't come uninvited — Duncan arranged for him to come (character writer establishes this). O'Neill authorized it. Joe arrives on a supply run, listed as "cultural liaison."

### Conflict 3: Joe/Pliny Scene — Multiple Versions

**A-plot pitch:** Joe in Pliny's archive room. "So you're the one who cataloged nature." / "I attempted to catalog all of it. I fell short." Rich dialogue about documentation. The candle/lamp/lighthouse metaphor.

**Character pitch:** Joe wanders into Pliny's villa. "They told me you wrote an encyclopedia." / "Thirty-seven volumes. Forty years." Leaking-roof story. Pliny's armaria. Pliny's vulnerability about Vesuvius.

**Threads pitch:** Pliny finds Joe. "You have the look of a man who writes things down." Pliny challenges Watcher non-interference philosophy. "A scholar who only observes is a mirror... A scholar who engages is a *lens*."

**Genre pitch:** Joe sees digital encyclopedia. Shows Pliny a Chronicle. "You have been doing what I do." / "Buddy, I've been doing what you do with worse handwriting."

**DECISION: Use the threads writer's OPENING LINE as the hook, then fold in the A-plot writer's structure and the character writer's emotional depth.** The threads writer's "You have the look of a man who writes things down" is the best opening — it's Pliny initiating, recognizing Joe's nature before Joe says anything. This is Pliny the observer.

**The compiled scene:**

1. **Opening:** Pliny's villa. Evening. Joe exploring. Pliny sees him in the doorway. "You have the look of a man who writes things down." (Threads writer)

2. **The handshake:** Joe explains the Watchers briefly. Thirty years of observation. "We observe. We record. We don't interfere." Pliny: "How many did you chronicle?" Joe: "Personally? One primary subject for twenty years." (Character writer)

3. **The mutual recognition:** Pliny's Naturalis Historia. Forty volumes. Eighty years. They recognize each other — same compulsion, same vocation. (A-plot writer's "two documentarians" analysis)

4. **The challenge:** Pliny pushes on non-interference. "A scholar who only observes is a mirror. A scholar who engages is a lens." Joe: "That's been the argument for a thousand years." Pliny: "And what has a thousand years of non-interference produced?" Joe: "A lot of files. Some of them very good." (Threads writer — this is too good to cut)

5. **The bond:** Joe pours himself wine without asking (character writer — "a bartender's instinct"). They settle in. Two documentarians, recognizing they share a faith — that writing things down matters.

**CUT:** The A-plot writer's candle/lamp/lighthouse metaphor — it's clever but it belongs in the Tag (Beat 21), not here. Save it for the Pliny/Joe evening scene. The genre fan's "worse handwriting" line is fun but too jokey for the emotional register of this scene — save for a lighter moment later.

**Placement:** Act Four, Beat 14. This is the emotional center of the episode.

### Conflict 4: Joe/Methos — On-Screen or Deferred?

**Genre pitch:** Full on-screen reunion. "You." / "Me." / "You brought the Chronicle?" / "I brought ALL the Chronicles."

**Threads pitch:** They see each other at dinner. A LOOK. No conversation. Deferred.

**Character pitch:** They don't interact directly. Methos doesn't seek Joe out. The tension of proximity. Deferred.

**DECISION: DEFER. 2-to-1 favors it, and it's the right call dramatically.** The Joe/Pliny relationship is this episode's new pairing. It needs the screen time. Adding a full Joe/Methos reunion would crowd the episode with two major new relationship beats. The genre fan's dialogue is electric ("You." / "Me.") but it deserves its OWN beat in a future episode — not a compressed version crammed into 1x07.

**What to include instead:** A LOOK. At Pliny's dinner (the Casey grace scene), Joe and Methos are both present. Their eyes meet across the table. Methos raises his wine cup — the smallest acknowledgment. Joe nods. That's it. The Highlander fans will vibrate. Everyone else sees an enigmatic moment. The conversation comes later.

**Why this works:** Methos's character is defined by control. He reveals himself on HIS schedule. Having a full reunion in someone else's villa, at someone else's dinner, surrounded by witnesses — that's not Methos. He would wait. He would choose the moment. The deferral IS Methos's character.

**Save for:** 1x09 or 1x10. A private scene. Late night. Wine. Then the genre fan's dialogue can breathe.

### Conflict 5: Three-Voice Algorithm Moment

**Genre pitch:** Joe / Pliny / Data. Joe = practice (Watcher craft), Pliny = mortality (written record outlives writer), Data = existential ("File I/O is how the dead speak to the living").

**A-plot pitch:** No specific three-voice moment. Overwrite/append discussion has multiple speakers but it's a full-room discussion.

**DECISION: Use the genre fan's three-voice moment with JOE / PLINY / DATA, but place it carefully and trim.** The 1x05 and 1x06 three-voice moments worked. The pattern should continue. Joe being one of the three voices is correct — it's his introduction, and the algorithm moment is how the audience learns who he IS.

**Placement:** During the Tag, Beat 21 (the Pliny/Joe evening scene). NOT during the main A-plot acts. Reason: the three-voice moment in 1x05 and 1x06 happened during the implementation acts. In 1x07, Joe isn't present during the technical implementation (Acts 1-3). He arrives in Act 4. The three-voice moment should happen AFTER the team has built persistence, when Joe and Pliny are reflecting on what it means. Data joins them — he's been working on file I/O all day and comes to the villa.

**Trim each to 3-4 lines max:**
- **Joe:** The Watcher practice. "I open the Chronicle. I write what I saw. I close the book. The observation survives the observer." (Genre fan, trimmed)
- **Pliny:** The mortality lens. "I wrote for forty years. I died. The volumes survived. The observation survived the observer." (Genre fan, trimmed)
- **Data:** The existential lens. "File I/O is how the dead speak to the living." (Genre fan — this line is perfect, keep intact)

The repeated phrase "the observation survives the observer" from Joe and Pliny, and then Data's inversion, gives the three-voice moment its structure.

### Conflict 6: Daniel/Joe Methos File Scene

**Threads pitch:** Late-night scene. Daniel asks Joe about Methos. Joe reveals Watcher entry from 280 BC — observer saw Methos flee Alexandria after visiting the Serapeum. Independent corroboration. "The Methos Chronicle has killed three Watchers."

**Character pitch:** Mentions Joe/Daniel intersection but doesn't stage the scene.

**DECISION: INCLUDE, as C-Plot Beat C4 in the Tag.** The threads writer's scene is essential for the season arc. It connects Joe's arrival to the Methos/Alexandria/Black Stone thread from 1x06. The independent corroboration — a Watcher in 280 BC saw Methos flee after visiting the Serapeum's lower levels — gives Daniel a second source. This is what transforms Daniel's investigation from "Methos told me something weird" to "two independent sources confirm something happened under Alexandria."

**Placement:** After Beat 19 (title moment), during the Tag. 60-90 seconds. Late night. Joe's quarters. Daniel finds him.

**Key dialogue to keep:**
- "Subject appeared disturbed by something in the lower levels."
- The margin note: "First recorded instance of the subject voluntarily leaving a center of learning."
- "Can I see the Chronicle?" / "Parts of it. The ones that are safe to share."
- "The Methos Chronicle has killed three Watchers and driven two others to quit."

### Conflict 7: Cold Open Specifics

**A-plot pitch:** Storm. Power fluctuation. Systems restart. Carter sees `internamentum_numerus = 0`. Writes "TABULAE CERATAE." SMASH TO MAIN TITLES.

**Others:** Reference the data loss but don't detail the cold open.

**DECISION: Use the A-plot writer's version entirely.** It's the strongest cold open — economical, devastating, visual. The zero on the screen is the inciting incident. Carter alone, in the dark, staring at the number that means everything they built is gone.

**One addition from the character writer:** Carter's notebook. She opens it to the page from 1x06 where she wrote "CANONICA." Below it, she writes "TABULAE CERATAE." The notebook as persistent storage — a visual that pre-echoes the episode's theme.

### Conflict 8: O'Neill's "Fifth Race" Beat

**Genre pitch:** O'Neill quiet beat — "That would have been useful." References his Ancient knowledge being volatile.

**A-plot pitch:** O'Neill says "Fix that." Efficient, pragmatic.

**DECISION: BOTH. They're in different scenes and serve different functions.**

- **Beat 1 (morning report):** O'Neill's "Fix that." This is strategic O'Neill — the commander who cuts through to the operational imperative. Use the A-plot writer's version.

- **Beat 5 or 7 (during the first successful write/read):** O'Neill's quiet "...That would have been useful." This is personal O'Neill — the man who lost the Ancients' knowledge because it was in volatile storage (his brain). Carter hears it. She knows what he means. Nobody explains.

**Keep the genre fan's analysis as a direction note:** the "Fifth Race" resonance is implicit, never stated. O'Neill doesn't say "when the Ancients filled my brain." The audience fills it in.

### Conflict 9: Joe Bringing Watcher Archives

**Genre pitch:** Joe brought ALL the Chronicles. Physical archives. Bombshell.

**Character pitch:** Open question — how much material?

**Threads pitch:** Joe has the Methos Chronicle at minimum.

**DECISION: Joe brings SELECTED Chronicles, not all.** Reasoning:

1. "ALL the Chronicles" is a logistical impossibility. The Watcher archive spans centuries and thousands of subjects. Joe couldn't carry it through a Stargate.

2. Joe bringing everything reduces the dramatic potential for future episodes. If all the data is already on Nova Roma, there's no reason to go back for more. Keep the full archive on Earth as a resource that requires effort to access.

3. What Joe brings: His personal field journals (30+ years of Duncan's Chronicle). The Methos Chronicle (or the portions he could access — some sections are classified above his clearance). A selection of key chronicles relevant to known Nova Roma Immortals. And his knowledge — decades of institutional memory that isn't in any written file.

4. The genre fan's "I brought ALL the Chronicles" can be ADAPTED: Joe brought all of HIS chronicles. "I brought everything I have." That's still significant — Joe's personal archive is extensive — without breaking the logistics.

### Conflict 10: Marcus's Role

**A-plot pitch:** Marcus is central — names the wax/stone metaphor, provides the engineering framework. "Now we are becoming a city."

**Character pitch:** Marcus is background.

**Historian pitch:** Strongly supports Marcus as the Roman voice for writing technologies.

**DECISION: Marcus is CENTRAL. Use the A-plot writer and historian's versions.** This is Marcus's second spotlight after 1x04. The wax/stone metaphor is HIS — it comes from his material culture, his engineering training. He should:

1. Name the wax/stone distinction (Beat 2) — the A-plot writer's scene is perfect
2. Provide the "when to sync" engineering insight (Beat 7) — syncing at meaningful boundaries, like completing a course of stone
3. Deliver the title moment line: "Now we are becoming a city" (Beat 19)
4. Have the Carter/Marcus walk (Beat 20) — their ritual continues

The historian adds: Marcus knows the legislative workflow (wax draft → stone inscription → archive). The stylus with write-on-one-end-erase-on-the-other is a visual he should handle. Pliny should hand Marcus a stylus during the naming scene, and Marcus should demonstrate the dual function.

## C. KEY SCENE DECISIONS

### Scene 1: Cold Open — The Loss
**Use A-plot writer entirely** + character writer's notebook detail.
Carter alone. Night. Storm. Machines restart. `internamentum_numerus = 0`. Opens notebook, writes "TABULAE CERATAE" below "CANONICA." SMASH TO MAIN TITLES.
**Who:** Carter alone.

### Scene 2: The Morning After (Beat 1)
**Use A-plot writer.** Carter reports to the team. "Everything is gone." Pliny's reaction ("Define 'everything'"). O'Neill: "Fix that."
**Who:** Carter, Marcus, Pliny, O'Neill. Full team.

### Scene 3: Marcus Names It — Wax and Stone (Beat 2)
**Use A-plot writer + historian's production design.** Marcus at the board. Wax tablets vs. stone inscriptions. "Memory is wax. Disk is stone." The stylus — write on one end, erase on the other (historian's detail).
**Who:** Marcus, Carter, Pliny.

### Scene 4: Carter's Blueprint — The Filum Library (Beat 3)
**Use A-plot writer.** Carter writes the three operations: Legere, Scribere, Appendere. Daniel and Lucia on the etymology of "filum" — thread, Ariadne's thread. Marcus on the two modes. Pliny: "I have never smoothed the wax on a completed volume."
**Who:** Carter, Daniel, Lucia, Marcus, Pliny.

### Scene 5: ACT BREAK — Dependency Chain Grows (Beat 4)
**Use A-plot writer.** The dependency chain on the board, six libraries deep. Data: "The boundary between computation and persistence. Between thought and record." Marcus: "Between wax and stone."
**Who:** Carter, Marcus, Data.

### Scene 6: The First Write (Beat 5)
**Use A-plot writer.** "Salve, Nova Roma!" Seventeen bytes. Disk light blinks. Carter unplugs/replugs the machine. The file survives. Pliny: "Do that with my encyclopedia."
**Add genre fan's O'Neill beat HERE:** After the successful write/read, O'Neill very quietly: "...That would have been useful." Carter hears it. No explanation.
**Who:** Carter, Pliny, O'Neill.

### Scene 7: The Streaming Writer + Buffer (Beat 6)
**Use A-plot writer.** Line-by-line writing. Census entries. "These lines are not on disk yet." Marcus's engineer instinct: "A gap during which the power could drop."
**Who:** Carter, Marcus.

### Scene 8: The Sync Moment (Beat 7)
**Use A-plot writer.** `filum_scriptor_sync(scriptor)`. "Buffer is wax. Disk is stone. Sync is the chisel." Marcus's engineering insight: sync at meaningful boundaries, not every word and not never.
**Who:** Carter, Marcus, Pliny.

### Scene 9: ACT BREAK — Overwrite vs. Append (Beat 8)
**Use A-plot writer.** The two modes demonstrated. Methos from his pillar: "The Borg overwrite. They don't append to a civilization." Pliny: "An encyclopedia that overwrites its own entries is not propaganda." Data: "History preserves the past. State replaces it." Marcus writes in Latin: *Civilitas quae appendit, meminit. Civilitas quae superscribit, obliviscitur.*
**Who:** Carter, Methos, Pliny, Data, Marcus.

### Scene 10: The First Read + File Status (Beat 9)
**Use A-plot writer.** Reading files back. Pliny's question about metadata. Carter: "Size. Type. Permissions." `FilumStatus` demonstrated.
**Who:** Carter, Pliny.

### Scene 11: Streaming Reader + Saving Census/Encyclopedia (Beats 10-11)
**Combine A-plot writer's Beats 10-11.** The streaming reader demonstrated on the encyclopedia. The ChordaAedificator from 1x03 used for long lines — the dependency chain in action. Data: "Reuse. The road built for military movement is later used for commerce." Then: saving the census (3,217 citizens, 0.34 seconds) and the encyclopedia (12,847 entries, 1.87 seconds). Pliny: "If I had had this tool in Stabiae, the original would have survived the eruption."
**Who:** Carter, Marcus, Data, Pliny.

### Scene 12: ACT BREAK — Teal'c's Error Test (Beat 12)
**Use A-plot writer.** Teal'c reads a file that doesn't exist. Error handling. "The test that matters is not whether the system can read what exists. It is whether the system is honest about what does not exist."
**Who:** Teal'c, Carter.

### Scene 13: Joe Dawson's Introduction (Beat 13)
**Use character writer's gate arrival + A-plot writer's visual walking details.** Joe comes through the gate last. Pauses at the event horizon. The limp, the cane, the guitar case, the satchel. Duncan first: "You could've mentioned the Romans." / "I did mention the Romans."
**Who:** Joe, Duncan. O'Neill present.

### Scene 14: Joe and Pliny — Two Documentarians (Beat 14)
**Compiled version (see Conflict 3 above).** The threads writer's opening line → character writer's emotional depth → threads writer's mirror/lens challenge. This is the episode's emotional center.
**Who:** Joe and Pliny.

### Scene 15: Joe's Story — The Leaking Roof + Methos on Copies (Beat 15)
**Use A-plot writer's structure with character writer's Vesuvius echo and Methos's closing.** Joe tells the leaky-roof story (A-plot and character versions are complementary — combine). Pliny's response: "Not by the enemy. By neglect." Carter from the doorway: the digital equivalent of neglect. Methos from the shadows: "The Library of Alexandria had copies. Copies in Pergamum, copies in Antioch... Do you know what happened to all the copies?" / "They didn't burn. Most of them rotted. Decades of neglect."
**Who:** Joe, Pliny, Carter, Methos.

### Scene 16: ACT BREAK — Saving the Vocabulary (Beat 16)
**Use A-plot writer.** Carter saves the interning table — 1,466 canonical words. Pliny touches the screen (echoing his Methos-like gesture from 1x06). Marcus: "What matters must endure. How it endures is an engineering problem. That it must endure is a human one."
**Who:** Carter, Pliny, Marcus.

### Scene 17: The Reload Test (Beat 17)
**Use A-plot writer.** The definitive test. Save everything. Full shutdown. Reboot. Read back. Census: identical. Encyclopedia: identical. Vocabulary: identical. Marcus: "The stone held." Pliny: "The eruption could not have taken this."
**Who:** Carter, Marcus, Pliny, full team observing.

### Scene 18: Teal'c's Test Suite (Beat 18)
**Use A-plot writer.** Fifteen tests. Fifteen VERITAS. Teal'c's observation on append-to-nonexistent-file: "A just system. It does not punish the first entry for being first."
**Who:** Teal'c, Carter.

### Scene 19: The Title Moment (Beat 19)
**Use A-plot writer.** The full dependency chain on the board. Marcus: "A settlement without records is a camp. A settlement with records is a city... Now we are becoming a city." Carter: "Tabulae ceratae — that's what we WERE. The title is what we've left behind."
**Who:** Carter, Marcus, Pliny, full team.

### Scene 20: Tag — Carter/Marcus Walk (Beat 20)
**Use A-plot writer.** Their ritual evening walk. Marcus: "The carving outlasts the carver." Carter: "You really think in thousands of years." Marcus: "I am Roman. We built roads two thousand years ago that people still walk on." 1x08 tease: "We need timestamps. A record without a date is evidence without a witness."
**Who:** Carter and Marcus.

### Scene 21: Tag — Pliny/Joe Evening + Three Voices (Beat 21)
**Compiled from multiple sources.**

Two sub-beats:

1. **Joe and Pliny at the villa.** Wine. The three-voice moment happens here (Joe/Pliny/Data — genre fan's trimmed version). Data joins them at the villa. Each explains persistence through their own lens. Joe: practice. Pliny: mortality. Data: "File I/O is how the dead speak to the living."

2. **Joe's Chronicle entry.** Joe alone. Opens his journal. Writes his first Nova Roma entry. The camera shows the handwriting: a new file, opened, first line written. `FILUM_MODUS_CREARE`. He closes the journal.

**Who:** Joe, Pliny, Data (sub-beat 1). Joe alone (sub-beat 2).

### Scene 22: Stinger — Kirk's ARCHIVUM (Beat 22)
**Compiled version (see Conflict 1 above).**
Physical filing cabinets. MACLEOD, D. dossier. "Digital for operations. Paper for secrets." 7/31. ARCHIVUM. "What is written, remains." Lock. SMASH TO BLACK.
**Who:** Kirk, aide.

---

## D. C-PLOT BEAT PLACEMENT

### Beat C1 (Early Act 1, between Beats 1-2): Joe/O'Neill Briefing
**Use threads writer.** O'Neill pulls Joe aside after the arrival. Briefs him on Kirk's network. "Seven sites we know about, probably more." Joe's Watcher intelligence instincts engage — he's been tracking covert Immortal networks for decades. O'Neill has a new intelligence asset.
**Who:** O'Neill, Joe.
**Timing:** 60-75 seconds.

### Beat C2 (During Act 3, between Beats 10-12): Carter Saves Temporal Data
**Use threads writer.** Carter's first personal use of the filum library: saving her compass data, oscillation patterns, temporal anomaly readings to disk. The data becomes persistent — and findable. "There. Now it's real." She discovers the oscillation has a periodic frequency — not random, structured. Seeds 1x08.
**Who:** Carter alone.
**Timing:** 45-60 seconds.

### Beat C3 (During Act 4, at Pliny's dinner): Casey's Grace + O'Neill's "Huh"
**Use character writer + threads writer.** The grace beat happens at Pliny's villa dinner. Casey bows his head. Three seconds. Crosses himself. O'Neill sees it. Later, walking back: "Did Casey just pray over Roman food?" / "He prays over everything." / "Huh."
**Who:** Casey, O'Neill, Duncan.
**Timing:** Two beats totaling 45 seconds (the grace itself + the walk-back exchange).

**Production note from historian:** Include the *lararium* (household shrine) in frame during the grace scene. Roman mealtime libations are established practice — Casey's prayer is recognizable as *religio* to the Romans, different in content but identical in form.

### Beat C4 (Tag, after Beat 19): Daniel/Joe — The Methos File
**Use threads writer entirely.** Late night. Daniel finds Joe. Asks about Methos and Alexandria. Joe reveals the 280 BC Watcher entry. "Subject appeared disturbed by something in the lower levels." The margin note: "First recorded instance of the subject voluntarily leaving a center of learning." Independent corroboration. "The Methos Chronicle has killed three Watchers."
**Who:** Daniel, Joe.
**Timing:** 60-90 seconds.

---

## E. WHAT TO INCLUDE FROM EACH PITCH

- The first write + unplug/replug proof (Beat 5)
- The buffer/sync distinction (Beats 6-7)
- The overwrite/append scene with Methos's Borg callback (Beat 8)
- The streaming reader + census/encyclopedia save (Beats 10-11)
- Teal'c's error handling test (Beat 12)

- The Kirk stinger's physical filing cabinets and MACLEOD, D. dossier (Beat 22)

**CUT:**
- Kirk's whiteboard word TABULARIUM (replaced with ARCHIVUM)
- Nothing else major. This is the backbone.

### From the Character Writer:
**KEEP:**
- Joe's gate arrival: "You could've mentioned the Romans" dialogue
- Joe's cover story: "cultural liaison" — simple, clean
- Joe as "the last one through" — pausing at the event horizon
- Joe's guitar case detail (physical character marker)
- Casey's grace scene — the full two-beat structure (grace + O'Neill's "Huh")
- The faith escalation table: O'Neill as the new observer (institutional authority)
- O'Neill's "He prays over everything" line (via Duncan)
- Carter's relationship to persistence and secrets — the tension of saving findable evidence
- Methos's complex reaction to persistence — relief + skepticism + personal threat
- Data's liberation beat: "I was never comfortable being essential to the preservation of knowledge"
- The ensemble persistence table (what each character wants to persist / fears about persistence) — use for beat sheet's thematic notes
- Duncan/Joe shorthand — "Mac" / "Good people." / "The best."
- O'Neill as observer-in-chief — filing Casey's prayer alongside Kirk's pattern
- Joe's Watcher background: expelled twice, took back because chronicles too good to lose
- Open Question resolution on Joe/Methos: DEFERRED (see Conflict 4)
- Open Question resolution on Watcher archive scope: SELECTED, not complete (see Conflict 9)

**CUT:**
- Joe's bar scouting scene — too early. Save for 1x09-10.
- Direct Joe/file-I/O-A-plot participation — Joe doesn't write code, he resonates thematically
- Joe/Midas scene — Joe noting an undocumented Immortal. Seed implicitly (Joe's eyes scanning the room), don't stage a scene.

### From the Threads Writer:
**KEEP:**
- The Casey escalation table (updated through 1x07)
- Beat C1: Joe/O'Neill briefing on Kirk's network — the wary/testing dynamic
- Beat C2: Carter saves temporal data — periodic frequency discovery
- Beat C3: Grace scene structure (threads writer aligns with character writer)
- Beat C4: Daniel/Joe Methos file scene — the full 280 BC Watcher entry
- The Kirk stinger word: ARCHIVUM (replacing TABULARIUM repeat)
- The Kirk progression table: seed → germination → root → branches → organization → standardization → **persistence**
- The Joe/Pliny "mirror vs. lens" challenge (incorporated into Beat 14)
- The nominalism/realism analysis (persistence as ontological upgrade) — for thematic notes
- The thread status appendix — include at end of beat sheet
- All backward/forward connection notes — include in continuity notes
- Joe as thread intersection analysis (Joe ↔ Duncan, Joe ↔ Pliny, Joe ↔ O'Neill, Joe ↔ Daniel, Joe ↔ Methos, Joe ↔ Midas, Joe ↔ Casey) — for continuity notes

**CUT:**
- The threads writer's Kirk stinger scene (server room with drives) — replaced by A-plot writer's filing cabinets version
- The threads writer's version of Joe/Pliny (Pliny initiating) — the opening line is kept but scene structure comes from A-plot/character writers
- The clock drift / temporal anomaly detail from C2 — keep the frequency discovery, cut the specific mechanism
- Joe seeing Midas and "starting a file" — too explicit for 1x07. Let Joe observe without narrating.

### From the Genre Fan:
**KEEP:**
- The three-voice algorithm moment: Joe / Pliny / Data (trimmed, placed in Tag)
- Data's line: "File I/O is how the dead speak to the living" — the best single line in any pitch
- O'Neill's "That would have been useful" beat (placed in Beat 5, after first successful write/read)
- The SG-1 "Torment of Tantalus" resonance — Daniel lost a library because nobody wrote it down. Direction note, not dialogue.
- The TNG "Inner Light" / Kataan probe parallel — for thematic notes
- The Watcher Chronicles mapped to filum API table — for thematic notes / series bible
- The append-only principle: "Append-only logs are the most honest form of documentation" — for thematic notes
- The Watchers as `FilumLector` / Joe as `FilumScriptor` — for thematic notes
- The dependency graph BRANCHING observation (filum goes back to chorda/piscina, doesn't extend the hash/intern chain) — for genre architecture notes
- Joe's Chronicle entry on screen during the Tag — "New assignment. Location: Nova Roma" — trimmed
- The observation about `FilumStatus` as realist philosophy: "The file knows what it IS" — for thematic notes
- The `wb` vs `ab` as philosophical shorthand — for thematic notes

**CUT:**
- The full Joe/Methos reunion scene — deferred (see Conflict 4)
- "I brought ALL the Chronicles" — scaled down (see Conflict 9)
- The COMMENTARII RETIS / Captain's Log stinger concept — too explicit
- The BSG 4096 / page size Easter egg — too deep even for this show
- The extended Foundation / B5 / BSG analysis (Sections 1, 4, 9) — for series bible, not beat sheet
- Joe's bar stool detail — charming but premature for 1x07
- The "Counterfeit" falsified chronicles discussion — save for when file integrity becomes relevant
- The Scotty / transporter buffer parallel — clever but too tangential

### From the Historian:
**KEEP:**
- The persistence hierarchy: wax → papyrus → stone → bronze → lead → ostraca — for Marcus's dialogue and thematic notes
- The stylus detail (write on one end, erase on the other) — give to Marcus as a physical prop in Beat 2
- The *codex* etymological connection (tablet bundle → book → code) — for Daniel/Lucia dialogue, Beat 3
- The legislative workflow (wax draft → stone inscription → archive) — Marcus knows this, informs Beat 2
- The survival paradox (disposable pottery survives, precious papyrus rots) — for thematic notes
- Grace as recognizable *religio* to Romans — production note for C3
- The *lararium* detail — include in frame during Pliny's dinner
- Pliny's *adversaria* (personal notebooks) as parallel to Joe's journals — for Beat 14 scene description
- The Tabularium architecture (connections to 1x05 Kirk stinger) — for continuity notes
- The Acta Diurna as write-once, append-only log — for thematic notes
- Latin terminology audit: all terms verified as correct classical Latin
- The Vindolanda / Herculaneum tablet archaeological examples — for production design reference
- Casey's grace and Roman mealtime observance (Cato's *lararium* prayer) — historical grounding
- Timeline check: 79 AD, Flavian dynasty, wax tablets at peak, codex format emerging — for continuity

**CUT:**
- The full bronze tablets / military diplomas section — too detailed for the episode
- The lead curse tablets / ostraca sections — fascinating but not dramatizable. Save for series bible.
- The full Pliny's villa production design — save for production bible, reference briefly in beat sheet
- The Notarii / Ab Epistulis / Eusebius parallels — for series bible, not beat sheet
- The extended Res Gestae detail — save for future episodes

## F. ELEMENTS TO DEFER

### Defer to Later Episodes:
- **Joe/Methos reunion scene** — 1x09 or 1x10. Private. Late night. Wine.
- **Joe's bar scouting** — 1x09-10. Joe looking at spaces in the Forum.
- **Joe bringing ALL Chronicles vs. selected** — the full Watcher digitization project is a multi-episode arc (1x09 onward, using XML for structured persistence)
- **File integrity / checksums** — beyond 1x07's scope. When corruption becomes relevant.
- **Encryption / access control** — seeded by Carter's concern about findable secrets, but TLS/encryption is 1x18
- **Joe/Midas scene** — Joe cataloging an undocumented Immortal. Seed by Joe's scanning eyes, pay off later.
- **Joe's music** — first guitar performance belongs at the bar opening (1x13)

### Defer to Series Bible / Thematic Notes:
- Foundation Encyclopedia Galactica as civilizational file I/O (genre fan)
- B5 Great Machine as persistence at civilizational scale (genre fan)
- BSG "Exodus" / DS9 "In the Pale Moonlight" as dramatic file I/O (genre fan)
- Highlander "Counterfeit" as corrupted persistence (genre fan)
- The Watcher Oath as access control policy (genre fan)
- `FilumStatus` as realist philosophy (genre fan)
- The survival paradox table (historian)
- Latin as dead=immutable=interned language (historian, from 1x06)
- The Septuagint as translated persistence (historian, from 1x06)
- Full Roman archive system (Tabularium/Aerarium/Provincial) details (historian)

## G. TITLE RESONANCE

### How Many Layers to Surface?

**DECISION: Surface THREE layers. Imply the fourth.**

1. **Technical (stated explicitly):** Wax tablets are what the system has been — volatile, erasable, temporary. "The title is what we've left behind." Carter says this in Beat 19. The episode is a farewell to wax.

2. **Roman cultural (stated by Marcus):** The wax-to-stone transition is the Roman workflow for making things official. Drafts in wax, laws in stone. The team has been drafting. Now they're carving. Marcus articulates this in Beat 2.

3. **Civilizational (stated by Marcus):** "A settlement without records is a camp. A settlement with records is a city." File I/O is what makes Nova Roma a city, not a camp. The wax tablets were the camp phase. Beat 19.

4. **Philosophical (implied, Nightcrawler approach):** Writing things down is a realist act — declaring something worth preserving. The nominalism thread (voiced by Methos's skepticism, Kirk's instrumental use, Joe's leaking-roof story of negligence) runs under the surface. Never named. The audience who has been tracking it since 1x03 sees it.

---

## H. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

### 1. Joe's Knowledge Asymmetry — Who Knows About the Watchers?

The character writer asks: how much does the team know about Joe being a Watcher?

**My recommendation:** Duncan knows everything. O'Neill knows Joe is a Watcher (he arranged the trip and was briefed). Casey knows about Watchers (he's Immortal). The rest of the team knows Joe is "Duncan's friend who keeps records" — a cultural liaison. This creates a useful knowledge asymmetry that doesn't become an issue in 1x07 but can be explored later.

**Fran to confirm or adjust.**

### 2. The Dinner Scene — How Large?

The grace beat (C3) and several character moments happen at Pliny's villa dinner. How crowded is this scene? The threads writer places the full team at the dinner. The character writer makes it more intimate.

**My recommendation:** Full team present (this is a Roman dinner — Pliny would host properly). But the camera work keeps focus on: Casey's grace, O'Neill's observation, Joe and Pliny sitting together, the Methos/Joe LOOK. The crowd is atmosphere. The moments are specific.

**Fran to confirm.**

### 3. O'Neill's "Fix That" — Tone

The A-plot writer gives O'Neill a clean, decisive "Fix that" exit. The character writer gives him a more colorful "You're telling me six episodes of work disappears if someone trips over the power cable?" Both work.

**My recommendation:** Use the character writer's more colorful version FIRST (it gets the laugh and shows O'Neill's personality), then end with the A-plot writer's clean "Fix that" exit. Both in Beat 1. O'Neill's full beat: "You're telling me we lose a week of work because of a thunderstorm?" / Carter: "Yes." / O'Neill: "Fix that." He leaves.

**Fran to confirm.**

### 4. Methos at the Dinner — How Present?

Methos is at Pliny's dinner. Joe is at Pliny's dinner. They exchange a LOOK (decided in Conflict 4). But how much does Methos participate in dinner conversation?

**My recommendation:** Methos is in his usual pillar-leaning, wine-in-hand mode. He's present but not central. His main scene in this episode is Beat 15 (the leaky-roof story, where he adds the Alexandria/copies warning). At dinner, he's background. The LOOK with Joe is a 3-second beat. The audience who knows Highlander feels the weight. Everyone else sees two people acknowledging each other.

**Fran to confirm.**

### 5. Carter/Casey Exchange — Include or Defer?

The character writer proposes Carter's fatigue beat from 1x06: "I wish intelligence worked that way. One truth, shared with everyone." / "What truth are you carrying?" / "Too many." This was placed in 1x06 and could carry forward here.

**My recommendation:** DEFER to 1x08. The 1x07 episode is already introducing a new character (Joe), has a dense A-plot, and four C-plot beats. Carter's secret-keeping weight is dramatized in C2 (saving temporal data to disk). Adding the Casey exchange would crowd the character work. Save it for 1x08, where timestamps and temporal coherence give Carter's burden a new dimension.

**Fran to confirm.**
