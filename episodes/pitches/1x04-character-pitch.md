# NOVUM FUNDAMENTUM
## Episode 1x04: "Codex Tabulae Exponentialis"
### Character & Flashback Pitch (Writers' Room Draft)

---

## THE SHAPE OF THE EPISODE

This is Marcus's episode. He's been learning in 1x01, absent (Earth-side) in 1x02, validating ("This is Roman. We would build it this way.") in 1x03. In 1x04, he LEADS. Carter lets him. And the B-plot — Duncan's cathedral flashback — is the emotional engine that makes Marcus's technical leadership feel like something larger than a census automation project.

The A-plot is the census: Nova Roma needs to count itself, and the counting changes. Growth without destruction. The Xar — the variable-length array — is the technical heart: a structure that grows as needed, doubling its capacity, never losing what it already holds. Roman roads. Roman engineering. *Addere sine delere.*

But the character pitch isn't about what Xar does. It's about what Xar *means* to the people building it.

## DUNCAN'S CATHEDRAL FLASHBACK

### The Trigger

Act Two. Marcus is in Pliny's workshop, alone with Carter and Casey, and he's doing something none of them expected: he's drawing. On a wax tablet, in clean Roman engineering notation, he's sketching the growth pattern of the Xar — the doubling strategy, the capacity curve, the moment when the old container is abandoned for the new one. He's not copying Carter's design. He's *extending* it, adding structural annotations in a shorthand that Carter recognizes as load-bearing analysis. The way a Roman engineer would annotate an aqueduct plan.

Duncan is in the doorway. He came to ask a logistical question — guard rotations, supplies, something mundane. But he stops. Watches Marcus draw.

And the memory takes him.

### The Cathedral (~1220s, Northern France)

**INTERCUT — FLASHBACK:**

A medieval town. Autumn. Scaffolding rising against a gray sky. The skeleton of a cathedral — not finished, not close to finished, but unmistakably *becoming*. Stone on stone. The sound of chisels. The smell of lime mortar and sawdust.

Duncan MacLeod is younger-looking in the way that means nothing for an Immortal — same face, different clothes, different century. He wears a sword. Nobody else here does. He stands at the edge of the construction site, watching.

The builders work in rhythm. A master mason directs a team lifting a keystone into a window arch. The stone settles. The mason checks the line with a plumb bob. Adjusts. Checks again. Nods. Moves on.

Duncan watches the mason's hands. Calloused, precise. The man doesn't look up. He doesn't scan the horizon for enemies. He doesn't carry a weapon. His entire world, in this moment, is the stone and the line and the truth of the plumb.

**DUNCAN (V.O., present-day, barely audible):** I watched him for three days. He never looked up. Not once.

Duncan in the flashback walks closer. A younger worker — an apprentice, maybe seventeen — is mixing mortar in a trough. He sees Duncan's sword.

**APPRENTICE:** You're not a mason.

**DUNCAN:** No.

**APPRENTICE:** What are you?

**DUNCAN:** *(pause)* A traveler.

**APPRENTICE:** Where are you going?

Duncan doesn't answer. Because the honest answer — which he can't give — is that he doesn't know. He's been in this town for two weeks. Before that, a skirmish outside Lyon. Before that, a year in Scotland. Before that, a decade of — what? Moving. Fighting. Protecting people who would age and die while he stayed the same.

**APPRENTICE:** The master says the nave won't be finished for another thirty years. His son will finish it. Maybe his grandson.

**DUNCAN:** And that doesn't bother him?

**APPRENTICE:** *(genuinely confused)* Why would it?

The apprentice goes back to his mortar. Duncan stands at the edge of the construction site, his hand on the pommel of his sword — a weapon among tools, a fighter among builders. He's fascinated. He's restless. He can feel the pull already. There's a conflict in Aquitaine. Someone needs a sword. Someone always needs a sword.

**CUT TO:** Duncan packing a saddlebag in a dim room. Dawn light through a rough window. He pauses. Looks out at the scaffolding. The cathedral isn't finished. Not even close. The workers are already stirring — another day, another course of stone.

He rides out before the sun clears the hills.

**DUNCAN (V.O., present-day):** I left before they finished the nave. I always left before they finished.

### The Pattern (Montage, 30 seconds)

Quick cuts, wordless, scored to the same ambient sound of chisels on stone:

- Duncan in a different town, different century. A bridge being built. He watches from horseback. Rides on.
- A monastery. Monks copying manuscripts. Duncan in the cloister, reading over a monk's shoulder. He's interested. He's already packed.
- A ship under construction. The ribs of the hull like a cathedral inverted. Duncan on the dock. Looking back as he boards a different ship.

The visual language is consistent: Duncan arrives. He sees something being built. He watches. He's drawn to it. And then he leaves — always before it's finished, always toward the next fight, the next crisis, the next place that needs what he carries on his hip instead of what these builders carry in their hands.

**DUNCAN (V.O.):** Four hundred years. I could have watched a thousand things get built. Instead I watched a thousand things get threatened, and I drew my sword.

### The Return (Present Day)

**SMASH CUT TO:** Duncan in the doorway of Pliny's workshop. Marcus is still drawing. Casey is looking over Marcus's shoulder, nodding slowly. Carter is at the keyboard, implementing what Marcus has designed.

Duncan watches Marcus's hands. The stylus on the wax tablet. The same focused precision as the master mason eight hundred years ago. The same refusal to look up from the work.

But this time, Duncan doesn't walk away.

He leans against the doorframe. Crosses his arms. Stays.

He doesn't know why. The audience does. For four hundred years, Duncan left before the peaceful part because his nature — the warrior, the protector, the man with the sword — told him that his value was in the fighting, not the building. He arrived for the crisis. He left when the crisis was someone else's patient labor.

And now, on Nova Roma, there is no crisis to ride toward. There is only this: a Roman engineer drawing growth curves on wax, and the sound of Carter's keyboard, and Casey quietly reading code, and the knowledge that what they're building will outlast all of them except Duncan himself.

He stays.

No dialogue marks the moment. The camera holds on Duncan in the doorway, watching, and then pulls back to include Marcus's drawing hand in the foreground and Duncan's still figure in the background. The composition rhymes exactly with the flashback: a builder in focus, a swordsman watching. Except this time, the swordsman isn't leaving.

## MARCUS'S ARC: THE MOMENT HE LEADS

### Where Marcus Has Been

In 1x01, Marcus asked the questions: "But in a real piscina, you cannot put the water back" — the sharp engineering mind identifying the metaphor's limits. He was learning. Receiving.

In 1x02, Marcus was on the periphery — the testing episode focused on Teal'c and Carter, with Marcus absorbing the methodology. His key moment was small: "When do you stop testing?" / "You do not."

In 1x03, Marcus validated. "This is Roman. We would build it this way." He recognized Chorda's design principles as Roman engineering instincts. He stood. He didn't sit. He watched Carter and stepped forward to annotate, not to lead.

In 1x04, something shifts.

### The Census Meeting (Act One)

The episode opens with a practical problem. The Nova Roma senate has asked for a census — not just Pliny's handwritten records, but a real count. Population. Trades. Resources. Districts. Pliny's forty volumes are comprehensive but static. The senate wants something that can grow as the colony grows.

Marcus walks into the workshop and does something he hasn't done before: he speaks first.

**MARCUS:** The census is not a document. It is a living record. When a child is born, the record grows. When a family moves districts, the record changes. When a trade guild adds members, the count adjusts. *(beat)* What you have built so far — the pool, the strings, the tests — these are materials. Now we need a structure that grows.

He's not asking Carter to explain. He's telling the room what the problem is, in Roman terms, and expecting the solution to follow.

Carter looks at Casey. A micro-expression — eyebrows up, the ghost of a smile. Casey returns it. They've been waiting for this.

**CARTER:** What kind of growth?

**MARCUS:** The kind Rome has always used. You build a road. It goes from here to there. But a road is not just the stones — it is the potential for more stones. Every road is an invitation to extend. You do not tear up the road to make it longer. You *add*.

**CARTER:** And what if the road reaches a cliff?

**MARCUS:** Then you build a bridge. *(beat)* But you do not destroy the road behind you.

This is the Xar pitch, from Marcus's mouth, in Roman metaphors. Carter doesn't correct him. She translates his architecture into code.

### The Handoff Moment

Mid Act Two. Carter has been implementing while Marcus designs. They've been working in tandem — Marcus sketching the growth strategy, Carter typing. At some point the dynamic inverts without anyone marking it.

Carter finishes a function. Turns the screen toward Marcus.

**CARTER:** Does this match what you drew?

She's asking *him* to verify *her* implementation against *his* design. The student is checking with the teacher. Except neither of them is either of those things anymore — they're collaborators, and Carter just acknowledged it by orienting the work toward Marcus's specification instead of the other way around.

Marcus reads the code. He's getting better at this — not fluent, but functional. He can follow the logic if the Latin naming is clear.

**MARCUS:** The growth — you double the capacity each time?

**CARTER:** It's a common strategy. Amortized constant time for appends.

**MARCUS:** *(shaking his head)* No. That is the mathematician's answer. The engineer's answer is: a road that doubles is a road that believes in the future. You are not just making space for what exists. You are making space for what will come.

**CARTER:** *(pause, then quietly)* That's better than my explanation.

She means it. She pushes her chair back six inches — literally making space for him at the center of the workspace. Marcus doesn't notice the gesture consciously. The audience does.

**CARTER:** *(to Casey)* Marcus should present the census system to the senate.

Casey nods. This isn't Carter being generous. It's Carter being strategic. If the Romans are going to own this technology, the Romans need to be the ones who present it. And Marcus is the bridge.

### Marcus and His People

Marcus preparing for the senate presentation. He's in his element — Roman political navigation. He knows the senators. He knows which ones are skeptical of the strangers, which ones are curious, which ones are looking for any advantage.

**MARCUS:** *(to Pliny)* Senator Gaius will ask if this replaces your work.

**PLINY:** And what will you tell him?

**MARCUS:** That it extends your work. That every number in the system came from your volumes first. That you are the foundation and this is the road built on it.

**PLINY:** *(wry)* And if he asks who builds the road?

**MARCUS:** *(carefully)* I will say: Romans build the road. With new tools. Given by friends.

Not "allies." Not "masters." *Friends.* Marcus is threading a needle — the senate needs to see this technology as Roman capability augmented by friendly expertise, not foreign imposition. He's protecting Carter by centering the Romans. He's protecting the project by centering the senate's pride.

This is the political intelligence that makes Marcus more than an engineer. He understands that the code must be accepted before it can be useful, and acceptance is a political act in a republic.

**PLINY:** You will make a good senator someday, Marcus.

**MARCUS:** *(surprised, then uncomfortable)* I am an engineer.

**PLINY:** So was the man who built the first aqueduct. They made him consul.

Marcus doesn't answer. But the seed is planted — the S3 election arc begins here, in a throwaway comment from a dying old man who sees further than anyone.

## THE CARTER/MARCUS HANDOFF — A CLOSER LOOK

The handoff isn't a single moment. It's a gradient across the episode. Here's how it reads beat by beat:

**Act One:** Carter leads the technical discussion. Marcus contributes the Roman engineering frame. Traditional dynamic from 1x01-03.

**Early Act Two:** Carter and Marcus work side by side. Equal contributions. She codes, he designs. Their conversation is peer-to-peer for the first time.

**Mid Act Two:** The scene described above — Carter asks Marcus to verify her implementation. The orientation flips.

**Late Act Two:** Marcus, alone with the wax tablet, redesigns the census data schema without Carter present. When she sees it, she doesn't revise. She implements.

**Act Three:** Marcus presents to the senate. Carter is in the gallery. She doesn't speak. She watches. When Marcus handles a senator's technical question correctly — without looking to Carter for confirmation — Casey leans over to Carter:

**CASEY:** *(quietly)* He doesn't need us anymore.

**CARTER:** *(watching Marcus)* He needs us less. That's not the same thing. But it's the goal.

The difference matters. Carter isn't being replaced. She's succeeding at the mission — knowledge transfer, not dependency creation. The whole project succeeds when the Romans can build without the Earth team. Every moment Carter makes herself less necessary is a victory.

## ENSEMBLE DYNAMICS

### Data and Midas

Their friendship from 1x02-03 continues its quiet deepening. In this episode, they have a specific function: they're the census's *test subjects*. Data volunteers himself and Midas as the first entries in the Xar-based census system — a Roman Immortal and a Starfleet android, both anomalies, both uncategorizable by normal standards.

**MIDAS:** *(watching his entry appear on screen)* "Midas. Age: three thousand, approximately. Trade: historical consultant. District: Forum." *(to Data)* They made me sound boring.

**DATA:** Accuracy and interest are not correlated.

**MIDAS:** You are the most honest person I've ever met, and I've met Aristotle.

**DATA:** I met Captain Picard. I believe the experiences are comparable.

**MIDAS:** *(delighted)* Data, that might be the first joke you've told.

**DATA:** It was not a joke. *(pause)* Although I acknowledge the structural similarity.

Their dynamic is the comic B-plot engine: Midas's warmth drawing Data out, Data's precision grounding Midas's flights. They're testing the census together — adding entries, removing entries, watching the Xar grow — and their friendship IS the test. Can a system designed for Roman citizens accommodate beings that don't fit the categories? The Xar says yes. It grows to fit what it's given. Like friendship.

### Teal'c

Teal'c is testing. He's always testing. But in this episode, his testing has a specific target: the growth behavior. What happens when the Xar doubles? What happens when it doubles again? What happens at the boundary — the exact moment the old allocation is abandoned?

**TEAL'C:** *(to Marcus)* Your road metaphor is incomplete. When the road extends, the old road remains. When your array grows, the old array is abandoned.

**MARCUS:** *(frowning)* The data is copied to the new space.

**TEAL'C:** The data, yes. The space, no. The old space returns to the pool. It is forgotten.

**MARCUS:** That is efficient.

**TEAL'C:** That is dangerous. If something still remembers the old road — still carries a map that points to where the road *was* — it will walk off a cliff.

Marcus stares at him. This is the dangling pointer problem, expressed as Roman cartography. Teal'c just identified the fundamental hazard of reallocation in a way that makes Marcus's engineering instincts fire.

**MARCUS:** Then we must ensure that every map is redrawn when the road moves.

**TEAL'C:** Or ensure that no one carries a map of a road that might move.

This beats gives Teal'c his testing moment for the episode AND plants the ownership/lifetime question that the show will return to repeatedly. Teal'c doesn't resolve it. He identifies it. That's his role: the man who finds the edge.

### O'Neill

O'Neill's role in this episode is lighter than in 1x02-03. He's logistics. He's perimeter. He's the man making sure the census project doesn't get disrupted by the mundane realities of running a settlement inside a potentially hostile situation.

But he gets one great scene: the census itself.

When Marcus demonstrates the census system to a small group before the senate presentation, O'Neill is present. He watches his own entry appear on screen.

**O'NEILL:** "Jack O'Neill. Age: classified. Trade: military consultant. District: Gate precinct." *(beat)* "Military consultant." That's generous.

**MARCUS:** What would you prefer?

**O'NEILL:** "Retired general who keeps getting un-retired against his expressed wishes." But that might not fit in the field.

**MARCUS:** The field grows to accommodate.

**O'NEILL:** *(looking at the screen)* That's actually pretty good. *(to Carter)* Can it do that for my tax bracket?

**CARTER:** Jack, there are no taxes on Nova Roma.

**O'NEILL:** *(standing up)* I'm never going back to Earth.

### Casey and the Rosary Beat

Per the outline: Casey's rosary is visible when he reaches into his pocket. The scene should be organic — Casey reaching for his pen, or a folded note, or the small toolkit he carries. The rosary shifts with the motion. Dark wooden beads, worn smooth. A Roman engineer across the workshop — one of Marcus's people, a man named Quintus — notices.

Quintus doesn't say anything. Not yet. But later, finding Marcus alone:

**QUINTUS:** The tall one. Casey. He carries counting beads.

**MARCUS:** *(not looking up from his work)* I have seen them.

**QUINTUS:** What does he count?

**MARCUS:** *(beat, then with a Roman's practical curiosity)* I will ask him.

Later. Marcus and Casey, end of a long work session. Marcus asks directly — Roman directness, no preamble:

**MARCUS:** Your beads. What are they for?

**CASEY:** They help me count.

**MARCUS:** *(the census-taker, immediately interested)* Count what?

**CASEY:** Prayers.

Marcus considers this. He's a man who counts things for a living — population, resources, distances, capacities. The idea that someone would count prayers doesn't strike him as strange. It strikes him as familiar.

**MARCUS:** How many prayers?

**CASEY:** Enough.

**MARCUS:** *(nodding slowly)* A man who counts knows the value of enough.

He goes back to his work. Casey watches him for a moment — something like recognition in his expression. Two men who count things. Different things. The same discipline.

### Daniel and Lucia

Their collaboration from 1x03 carries forward. In this episode, they're working on the terminology for the Xar — the variable-length array needs a vocabulary, and it needs to be Roman.

**LUCIA:** *Xar*. You propose this as the name?

**DANIEL:** It's Carter's working term. It needs a Roman equivalent.

**LUCIA:** What does it mean?

**DANIEL:** It's... an abbreviation. An acronym, really.

**LUCIA:** *(distaste)* Acronyms are the death of language. What does the thing DO?

**DANIEL:** It grows. It holds things. More things than you expected, because it makes room.

**LUCIA:** *(thinking, tapping her stylus)* *Arca crescens.* A growing chest. No — a chest implies fixed walls. *(pause)* *Xar* is ugly but honest. It tells you nothing and hides nothing. Perhaps that is the right quality for a container that holds anything.

**DANIEL:** You're keeping it?

**LUCIA:** I am accepting it under protest. *(she writes it in her lexicon)* *Xar: receptaculum longitudine variabili.* A container of variable length. *(looking up)* Your acronym is now a Latin word. You're welcome.

Daniel smiles. They've found their rhythm — he proposes, she interrogates, they arrive somewhere neither started. The physical dynamic from 1x03 continues: intellectual closeness, physical distance. When he leans forward to read her lexicon entry, she doesn't lean back — but she doesn't lean forward either. The space between them is an agreement neither has named.

### Pliny

The census is Pliny's *life*. Forty volumes of handwritten records. Every birth, every death, every trade, every district change — all in his cramped, precise handwriting. He has been the census for eighty years.

And now a machine does it in seconds.

The episode needs to handle this carefully. In 1x03, Pliny said: "I am not being replaced. I am being given wings." That sentiment carries forward, but here it's tested. The census was *his*. Marcus building a system that automates it — that *replaces* the need for Pliny to record each entry by hand — is different from the report generator. The report generator used Pliny's data. The census system *is* Pliny's function.

**PLINY:** *(examining the Xar-based census)* When a child is born, who records it?

**MARCUS:** Any registrar. The system accepts the entry and grows to accommodate it.

**PLINY:** And the old entries?

**MARCUS:** Preserved. Unchanged. The new entry simply... joins them.

**PLINY:** *(long pause)* For eighty years, every name in Nova Roma passed through my hand. I held each one. Weighed the ink. Knew the family. Saw the face of the father who came to register.

Another pause. The room is quiet.

**PLINY:** This is better. *(beat)* A census that depends on one old man's hand is a census that dies when the old man does. A census that grows on its own... that lives. *(to Marcus)* You have built something that will outlast me. That is the kindest thing an engineer can do for a scholar.

Pliny's grace in this moment is earned by his character: a man who has always cared more about the work than about his role in it. He sees the Xar as the fulfillment of what he was trying to do, not the erasure of it. His data — every name he weighed and recorded — is the seed. The Xar is the vessel that lets the seed grow beyond one man's lifespan.

### Methos

Methos is present but peripheral. He's at Joe's not-yet-a-bar (Joe's in town by now, setting up), drinking wine and reading one of Pliny's volumes. He drifts through the census discussion once, catches the tail end of Marcus's road metaphor, and offers exactly one contribution:

**METHOS:** *(not looking up from his wine)* The Romans built fifty thousand miles of road. Do you know what happened to most of them?

**MARCUS:** They lasted.

**METHOS:** They lasted because they were *maintained*. Every road had a curator. Someone responsible for its upkeep. Your growing array — does it have a curator? *(he takes a sip)* Or do you assume it will maintain itself?

He goes back to his wine. Marcus stares at him, then at Carter. This is the maintenance/stewardship question — who owns the data structure over time? Who ensures it doesn't degrade? Methos, the five-thousand-year-old, has watched enough civilizations build brilliant infrastructure and then forget to maintain it. His contribution to the episode is one question, delivered with absolute casualness, that the team will be answering for the rest of the series.

## KEY DIALOGUE EXCHANGES

### Marcus Speaking with Roman Engineering Authority

**MARCUS:** *(to the senate, during the presentation)*

We count ourselves because a republic that does not know its people cannot serve its people. This is not new. Rome has counted since the days of Servius Tullius. What is new is the ledger.

*(He gestures to the screen — the census data, structured, growing.)*

A stone tablet holds what you carve. A scroll holds what you write. But the colony grows. Families form. Children are born. People take new trades. The old ledger does not grow with us. It is a portrait, not a mirror.

What we have built is a mirror. It shows us as we are — now, today. When we change, it changes. When we grow, it grows. Not by erasing what was, but by adding what is.

Pliny gave us the foundation — eighty years of his hand, his eye, his devotion. We have built on his foundation a living document. Not to replace his work. To honor it by making sure it never stops.

*(Silence. A senator nods. Then another.)*

### Duncan's Interior Moment

This is voice-over during the flashback intercut, delivered in Duncan's quiet, reflective register — the voice he uses when he's talking to himself more than anyone:

**DUNCAN (V.O.):** The mason worked on the cathedral for twenty-three years. He never saw the finished nave. His apprentice — the boy who mixed mortar — became the master. He worked on it for another nineteen. Neither of them saw it completed. The cathedral took ninety years.

*(Present day: Marcus drawing on the wax tablet.)*

I could have stayed for all ninety. I had the time. I had nothing but time. But I rode to Aquitaine because someone needed a sword, and I told myself that the sword was more important than the stone.

*(Present day: Duncan leaning against the doorframe, watching.)*

Four hundred years of that. Arriving for the fighting. Leaving before the building. And every cathedral I left behind got finished without me.

*(Long pause.)*

I don't know what's different here. Maybe nothing. Maybe I'll ride out tomorrow toward the next fight. But tonight — Marcus is drawing, and the drawing is good, and I want to see what he builds.

### The Carter/Marcus Handoff

Already detailed above, but the culminating exchange:

**CARTER:** *(after Marcus handles a senator's question without looking to her)* He's ready.

**CASEY:** For what?

**CARTER:** To not need me for this part. *(beat)* That's the mission, Casey. Not building the system. Building the people who build the system.

**CASEY:** *(quietly)* I spent thirty years building alone because I couldn't trust anyone else to build right. *(watching Marcus)* He builds right.

**CARTER:** He builds *Roman*. That's better than right. That's *his*.

### O'Neill Comedy Beat

**O'NEILL:** *(watching the Xar demonstration — the array growing, entries being added)*

So it just... gets bigger?

**CARTER:** It doubles in capacity when it needs more space.

**O'NEILL:** Doubles. Every time.

**CARTER:** Every time it runs out of room.

**O'NEILL:** So if I put in one thing, and it grows, and I put in another thing, and it grows again...

**CARTER:** It won't grow every time. Only when it's full.

**O'NEILL:** But when it does grow, it doubles.

**CARTER:** Yes.

**O'NEILL:** *(counting on his fingers)* So after a few doublings, this thing is... huge.

**CARTER:** That's the exponential in the title. *Tabulae Exponentialis.*

**O'NEILL:** *(to Marcus)* You named it "the thing that gets exponentially bigger"?

**MARCUS:** That is what it does.

**O'NEILL:** I like the honesty. Most people name things to hide what they do. *(standing up)* Okay. I have a logistical question. If everything doubles, what doubles the food supply? Because I've seen exponential growth in military operations and the thing that always runs out first is the sandwich budget.

**MARCUS:** *(completely serious)* I will add a provision tracking module.

**O'NEILL:** See, this is why I like working with engineers. You hear "sandwich" and you think "module."

## THE VISUAL RHYME: STONE AND CODE

The flashback and the present day should be connected visually, not just thematically. Specific rhymes:

1. **The master mason's plumb line** rhymes with **Marcus's straight-edge on the wax tablet**. Both men checking that the line is true. Both refusing to proceed until it is.

2. **The scaffolding of the cathedral** rhymes with **the indentation structure of the code on screen**. Nested levels. Temporary support for permanent structure.

3. **Duncan's hand on his sword pommel** (flashback) rhymes with **Duncan's arms crossed** (present day). Same gesture of readiness, transformed from "ready to fight" to "ready to watch."

4. **The apprentice's mortar trough** — wet mortar, raw material — rhymes with **the Piscina allocation output on screen**. Raw memory, ready to be shaped.

5. **Duncan riding away at dawn** (flashback, the cathedral behind him, unfinished) is the mirror of **Duncan leaning in the doorway at dusk** (present day, the workshop behind Marcus, work ongoing). Same framing. Opposite motion. He left the cathedral. He stays for the code.

---

## THE EMOTIONAL ARC

The episode moves through three emotional registers:

**Act One: Confidence.** Marcus steps up. The census problem is HIS domain — he's a Roman engineer, and counting a population is what Roman engineers do. The energy is forward-moving, purposeful. Duncan's flashback hasn't started yet. The episode reads as a straightforward technical/political story.

**Act Two: Reflection.** Duncan's flashback introduces the melancholy. The cathedral he left. The pattern of four hundred years. The restlessness. Meanwhile, Marcus hits his first real obstacle — the senate's skepticism, Teal'c's testing pressure, the realization that building something for three thousand people is different from building something for a workshop. The energy slows. Deepens.

**Act Three: Arrival.** Marcus presents to the senate. Duncan watches from the gallery — positioned like he was at the cathedral, at the edge, observing. But when the presentation succeeds, when the senators nod, when the census goes live with its first real entries — Duncan doesn't leave. The camera finds him in the gallery, still there, and for the first time all episode he looks *settled*. Not happy, not triumphant. Settled. Like a man who has found the chair he didn't know he was looking for.

The tag should be Duncan and Marcus, alone, after the senate session. Not a long scene. Just a moment.

**MARCUS:** You were watching today. In the gallery.

**DUNCAN:** I was.

**MARCUS:** You watch often. Like a man waiting for something.

**DUNCAN:** *(long pause)* I've spent a long time watching things get built. I usually leave before they're finished.

**MARCUS:** *(matter-of-fact)* Then don't leave.

Duncan looks at him. Marcus isn't being philosophical. He's being Roman — direct, practical, unsentimentally honest. *Don't leave* isn't an emotional plea. It's engineering advice. If the structure requires your presence, stay.

**DUNCAN:** *(quietly)* I'm working on it.

FADE TO BLACK.

## NOTES ON WHAT THIS EPISODE SETS UP

- **Duncan's arc toward S2 Florence flashback:** The 1x04 cathedral fragment is deliberately incomplete. The audience sees Duncan leaving, sees the pattern, feels the weight. The FULL Florence flashback — Brunelleschi and the Duomo — is deferred to S2 where it will land with the accumulated context of Duncan having *stayed* on Nova Roma for an entire season. When the audience sees the Florence flashback in S2, they'll know: this time, he watched the whole thing. This time, he saw it finished.

- **Marcus's political arc:** The senate presentation seeds everything that leads to his election in S3. The senators see him as a translator between worlds. The Romans see him as one of their own who can speak the strangers' language. He doesn't want the political role. He's an engineer. But Pliny sees it, and Pliny is rarely wrong about the shape of things to come.

- **The Pliny farewell arc:** Pliny's grace in ceding the census function foreshadows his S3 death — a man who has spent eighty years making himself essential, now peacefully making himself unnecessary. Every time Pliny says "this is better," he's one step closer to being finished. Not with resentment. With the satisfaction of a craftsman whose work will survive him.

- **Teal'c's dangling pointer question:** This is not resolved in 1x04. It's a thread that runs through the series — the problem of references to things that have moved or been freed. Teal'c identifies it. The solution takes seasons to evolve. The question "who ensures that every map is redrawn when the road moves?" is, at its deepest level, a question about governance: who maintains the infrastructure?

- **Duncan and Casey, the emerging parallel:** Both are Immortals. Both have watched centuries of building. Casey built alone for thirty years. Duncan fought alone for four hundred. They're converging on the same realization from opposite directions: Casey learning that he can trust others to build, Duncan learning that building is worth staying for. Their friendship — which the show hasn't explicitly named yet — is forming in the margins.
