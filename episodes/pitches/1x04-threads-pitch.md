## 1. CASEY'S FAITH BEAT: The Rosary and the Census

### Placement

This beat lands in the back half of Act Two — after the Xar is working but before the full census is running. The episode's A-plot has been building toward the census: Marcus has been explaining how Nova Roma's growing population has outstripped their record-keeping, and the team has been building the Xar to hold a dynamic, growing collection of citizen records. The mood is productive, engaged, slightly exhausted — late afternoon work.

### The Scene

Marcus and Casey are at a workbench together. Marcus is scratching census categories onto a wax tablet — family name, trade, district, number of household members — while Casey enters them into the Xar as test data. They're working in tandem, the way a foreman and a surveyor work — one measuring, the other recording.

Casey reaches into his jacket pocket for a stylus he's been using to annotate Carter's printouts. As his hand comes out, something catches — a loop of dark wooden beads, briefly visible, tangled with the stylus. Casey untangles them without looking, the way you'd untangle keys from a lanyard. A habitual motion. He doesn't display them. He tucks them back.

Marcus's eyes follow the beads. He's been counting all day — three thousand citizens, organized by family, district, trade. His life for the past year has been an act of counting. The beads register as familiar.

**MARCUS:** What are those?

Casey glances down at his pocket. Realizes what Marcus saw.

**CASEY:** They help me count.

Marcus sets down his tablet. The census-taker's interest is genuine — counting is his domain.

**MARCUS:** Count what?

**CASEY:** Prayers.

Beat. Marcus considers this. He picks up his wax tablet again — the census tablet, covered in tick marks and names.

**MARCUS:** I count citizens. Families. The timber stores and the grain reserves and the number of children born each season. *(beat)* There is always more to count than I expected.

**CASEY:** Yeah. *(quiet)* Same.

Marcus nods. Not the nod of a man who's been converted to something. The nod of a man who recognizes a fellow counter. They go back to work.

### Why This Works

The beat is organic because it emerges from the physical action of the scene — Casey reaching for a tool and the rosary getting caught. It's not staged or presented. It's the kind of thing that happens when you carry things in your pockets.

The connection to the episode's theme is precise: **counting** is the unifying verb. Marcus counts citizens (census), the Xar counts elements (numerus_elementorum), Teal'c counts tests (assertions passing or failing), and Casey counts prayers. Different kinds of accounting — civic, computational, epistemic, spiritual — all expressing the same impulse: to know the measure of what you have. The rosary IS a counting technology. The abacus and the rosary are cousins. A man who counts prayers and a man who counts citizens recognize each other across the gap because counting is counting. The tool is different. The discipline is the same.

The scene also plants the seed for 1x09-10, where a Roman asks more directly about the rosary beads ("How many prayers?" / "Enough."), and for the deeper Pliny conversations in 1x15. Marcus doesn't ask *about* the prayers here. He asks about the counting. The theology comes later, if it comes at all. For now, it's just two men who understand that there is always more to count than you expected.

## 2. KIRK EARTH-SIDE STINGER: The Fourth Node

### The Growth Rhyme

The A-plot's growth principle: the Xar adds segments without destroying existing ones. When it needs more capacity, it allocates a *new* segment — the old data stays where it was. Growth without destruction. Nothing moves. Everything accumulates.

Kirk's stinger must rhyme with this.

### The Scene

**Location:** Earth. Night. A strip mall parking lot somewhere in the Pacific Northwest — Tacoma, maybe Olympia. The kind of place nobody looks twice at. A UPS Store. A nail salon. A Subway. And at the end of the strip: an unmarked office with blacked-out windows. A business that could be anything — tax preparation, insurance, IT support.

Kirk walks across the parking lot. Suit. No hurry. A man who belongs wherever he decides to belong.

He enters the office. Inside: three people at workstations. They don't look up when he enters. They're already working. The green glow of their monitors reflects off their faces — but the green is slightly wrong. Slightly too organic. The same shade.

Kirk walks past them to a whiteboard on the far wall. It's a map. Pins — four of them now. Portland (from 1x03). Seattle (mentioned in 1x03's C-plot). San Francisco. And now here — wherever this is. Four nodes. Lines drawn between them.

He adds the fourth pin. Steps back. Looks at the map the way Marcus looks at a census tablet: assessing what he has, calculating what he needs.

**KIRK:** *(to the room, without turning)* The Portland relay is stable?

**VOICE:** Stable. Sixty-three hosts.

**KIRK:** San Francisco?

**VOICE:** One hundred eleven.

Kirk nods. He traces the lines between pins. The network is growing. Each node independent. Each node intact. None destroyed to build the next.

His Xar, so to speak.

He writes a number on the whiteboard: **4 / 31**. Four nodes active. Twenty-seven to go. The denominator is chilling — this is a man with a specific plan and a specific count.

He caps the marker. The camera holds on the map. Four pins. Four segments of a growing array. The ledger expands.

SMASH TO BLACK.

### Why This Works

The stinger rhymes with the A-plot on every level:

- **Structural:** The Xar grows by adding segments without moving old data. Kirk grows his network by adding nodes without disturbing existing ones. Portland is still running. Seattle is still running. Growth by accumulation, not replacement.
- **Numerical:** Marcus counts citizens; Kirk counts hosts. Both are conducting a census of their resources. Both are building toward a capacity they haven't reached yet.
- **Visual:** The whiteboard map with pins mirrors Marcus's census tablets with tick marks. Two ledgers, growing.
- **Thematic inversion:** The Xar grows to serve — to hold the census of a free people, to track resources for a community. Kirk's network grows to assimilate — each "host" is a compromised person, an infrastructure node, a piece of the invasion. Same growth mechanic. Opposite purpose. The dark mirror.
- **The number:** 4/31 tells the audience Kirk has a plan with a specific scope. Not infinite growth — targeted growth. He knows exactly how many nodes he needs. That precision is scarier than ambiguity.

### Progression of Kirk Stingers (1x01-1x04)

| Episode | Stinger | Growth Stage |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1x01 | Kirk and Data arrive on Earth. Naked, vulnerable, alone. | Seed |
| 1x02 | Kirk on a hill with a stolen laptop. First line of code. Green cursor. | Germination |
| 1x03 | Kirk in a server farm in Portland. A guard doesn't remember stopping. | First root |
| **1x04** | **Kirk in a strip mall office. Four pins on a map. 4/31. Three workers with green-tinged screens.** | **First branches** |

The progression matches the Xar's growth pattern: one element, then a segment fills, then a new segment is allocated. Kirk's network is his Xar. The audience may not consciously recognize the parallel, but they'll feel it — the rhythm of accumulation that the A-plot has been teaching them all episode is the same rhythm the stinger uses to make their skin crawl.

## 3. C-PLOT THREADING: Kirk/Borg Beats During the Episode

Following the 1x03 pattern of four woven C-plot beats:

### Beat C1 (Early Act 1): The Missing Persons Report

Duncan, during a morning briefing before the census work begins, reports to O'Neill: two tech workers in Seattle have gone "off-grid." Not dead — just gone. Social media silent. Phones off. Apartments abandoned. Their employer says they resigned by email on the same day, using identical language.

**DUNCAN:** Identical resignation letters. Word for word.

**O'NEILL:** Maybe they used the same template.

**DUNCAN:** *(flat)* Maybe.

This is Kirk recruiting. The audience knows it. The characters suspect it. The C-plot's growth theme begins: Kirk's roster is expanding.

### Beat C2 (Mid Act 1 or Early Act 2): The Server Farm Pattern

Carter, reviewing data between census sessions, intercepts another brief Borg-encoded transmission — the third since 1x03's Oregon signal. This one originates from a commercial data center in San Jose. By the time she triangulates, the signal has stopped. But the metadata reveals something new: the transmission wasn't *from* a single server. It was *distributed* across forty machines, each contributing a fragment.

**CARTER:** He's not using single points anymore. The signal was distributed. Forty sources, one message.

**CASEY:** *(quiet)* He's building redundancy.

The parallel to the Xar is explicit for the attentive: Kirk's network, like the Xar, doesn't concentrate data in one location. It distributes across segments. If you destroy one server, the others continue. Growth without single points of failure — the same design principle the team is building into their census system, weaponized.

### Beat C3 (Late Act 2): O'Neill's Perimeter Check

O'Neill has been quiet all episode — watching the census work, making the occasional dry comment. But between scenes, he's been doing his own counting. He pulls Casey aside:

**O'NEILL:** How many people know about the gate location?

**CASEY:** Our team. The Romans. Midas. That's it.

**O'NEILL:** Kirk knew about Nova Roma when he escaped. He knew about the mission. He knew about our people. What he didn't know was the gate address.

**CASEY:** You think he's working toward that?

**O'NEILL:** He's got nodes in Portland, Seattle, San Francisco. He's building infrastructure. He's recruiting people. That's not random growth. That's an approach vector.

O'Neill is applying census logic to threat assessment — counting what Kirk has, projecting what he needs. The general's version of Marcus's engineering intuition: count the stones before you lay them.

### Beat C4 (During or just after the census presentation): Duncan Feels It

A brief scene. Duncan standing on the walls of the Forum Stellarum at dusk, looking outward. Methos finds him.

**METHOS:** The census went well.

**DUNCAN:** Three thousand people. *(beat)* Every one of them a target now.

**METHOS:** They were targets before we counted them.

**DUNCAN:** But now we know how many. And so does Kirk, if he's paying attention. A census tells you what you have to protect. It also tells an enemy what you have to lose.

**METHOS:** *(after a moment)* That's always been the problem with writing things down.

The double edge of the census: knowledge is power for the defender AND the attacker. The Xar holds everything — and everything it holds can be read. This plants a seed for 1x18 (Arcanum/TLS) when encryption becomes necessary because the information they've been building is now valuable enough to steal.

## 4. THEMATIC NOTES: "Codex Tabulae Exponentialis"

### Title Shift Across the Episode

Like "Credo" and "Verba Nova," the title "Codex Tabulae Exponentialis" — The Growing Ledger — shifts meaning across the episode:

- **Act 1:** "The Growing Ledger" = the census. Marcus's problem. Nova Roma has outgrown its record-keeping. The population is growing faster than Pliny's scrolls can track. The ledger needs to grow with the civilization. Literal meaning: a book of records that can expand.

- **Act 2:** "The Growing Ledger" = the Xar. A data structure that grows without destroying what came before. The computational solution to the census problem. Technical meaning: a table that doubles its capacity exponentially, segment by segment.

- **Act 3:** "The Growing Ledger" = the show's ledger. The audience is accumulating characters, relationships, technologies, threats. The show itself is a growing ledger — 1x01 was the first segment (Piscina), 1x02 added Credo, 1x03 added Chorda. Now 1x04 adds Xar. The layers build. Nothing is discarded. Every episode stays in memory. Meta meaning: the show is a Xar of episodes, and the audience is conducting a census of what they know.

- **Stinger:** "The Growing Ledger" = Kirk's ledger. His map with four pins. His count: 4/31. He too is keeping a codex that grows exponentially. Dark meaning: the enemy's ledger grows alongside ours, using the same principles.

### Growth Without Destruction: The Unifying Principle

The Xar's core design philosophy — **elements never move; growth happens by adding segments, not by reallocating and copying** — operates as the episode's moral physics on every level:

**Computational:** The Xar allocates new segments from the Piscina when it needs more room. Existing data stays exactly where it was. No reallocation. No copying. No invalidation of existing pointers. You can hold a reference to element 0 and it will still be valid after element 10,000 is added. Growth is *additive*, never *destructive*.

**Biological/Demographic:** Nova Roma's population grows. New children are born, new families form, the town expands into new districts. But the existing families aren't displaced. The original exiles' houses aren't torn down to build new ones. The civilization grows the way a tree grows — adding rings, not replacing them.

**Architectural (Roman Roads):** Marcus's engineering metaphor, which runs through the episode: Roman roads are built by adding segments. You don't tear up the road from Rome to Naples to build the road from Naples to Brindisi. You extend. Each new segment connects to what came before. The network grows without destroying its origins.

**Personal (Marcus):** Marcus is growing as a leader. He began in 1x01 as a skeptical engineer, became a collaborator in 1x02-03, and now in 1x04 he's taking initiative — designing the census categories, proposing organizational structures, translating Carter's abstractions into Roman engineering idioms without being asked. His growth doesn't destroy who he was. The skeptical engineer is still in there. He's added a new capacity on top of the old one.

**Personal (Duncan):** Duncan's flashback — watching a medieval cathedral going up stone by stone, leaving before it's finished, always leaving before things are finished — and then watching Marcus lay digital foundations and choosing to *stay*. Duncan is adding a new segment to his own character: the capacity to build, not just fight. This doesn't destroy the fighter. It extends him.

**Civilizational:** Nova Roma is expanding — not by conquering neighbors (there are no neighbors), but by growing from within. New institutions, new knowledge, new infrastructure. All additive. All building on the foundation. The Piscina from 1x01 is literally still running underneath the Xar. The Credo tests from 1x02 are still verifying. The Chorda strings from 1x03 are what the census records are made of. **Nothing from previous episodes has been thrown away. Everything compounds.**

**The Dark Mirror:** Kirk's growth also follows this principle — but in service of assimilation, not civilization. His network doesn't destroy its nodes to build new ones. The compromised worker in Portland is still compromised while new workers are recruited in Seattle. Growth without destruction — but the "growth" is infection, and the "destruction" it avoids is detection. Same principle, inverted purpose.

### The Census Connection: Luke 2 and the Biblical Resonance

There is a census in the background of the most important story in Western civilization.

*"In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world."* (Luke 2:1)

It was a census that brought Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem. A bureaucratic act of counting — how many people, where do they live, what do they owe — created the conditions for the Incarnation. The census as infrastructure for providence. The mundane mechanism through which the transcendent arrives.

The show doesn't need to SAY this. But the resonance is there for anyone who knows it: a Roman census, on a world reached through a gate, where something new is being born. The census doesn't cause the miracle. It just makes sure everyone is in the right place when it happens.

If the writers want to plant this very lightly: Pliny, examining the completed census printout, could note in passing that census records have always preceded great changes. "When Augustus counted the empire, something new was about to begin. We Romans have always counted before building." A throwaway line from a historian. The audience can find it or not.

### Moderate Realism and the Nature of Collections

The Xar embodies moderate realism in a specific way that deepens the show's philosophical throughline:

A Xar is a *real thing* — not just a convenient grouping. It has a nature: it grows, it holds elements, it knows its own size (`xar_numerus`). It has properties that are intrinsic, not imposed from outside. The number of elements IS a property of the Xar, not something you discover by scanning to the end (contrast with null-terminated strings — the nominalist approach to "how many?").

The census, similarly, is not just a list. It's an act of recognition. When Marcus counts the citizens, he isn't creating them — he's acknowledging what's already real. Three thousand people existed before the census. The census makes their existence *legible* — to the senate, to the engineers, to history. The moderate realist position: the universal ("citizen of Nova Roma") is real, grounded in the particular (each individual person), and the census is the instrument that makes the universal visible.

The Borg position (the nominalist inversion): individuals are interchangeable units. The census doesn't recognize persons — it inventories resources. Kirk's "census" of his network (4/31) treats compromised humans as nodes, not persons. Same counting. Opposite ontology.

## 5. CONNECTIONS TO PREVIOUS EPISODES

### 1x01 (Piscina) -> 1x04 (Xar): Foundation Supports Growth

The Xar allocates its segments from the Piscina. When `xar_addere` is called and a new segment is needed, the Xar calls `piscina_adquirere` to get the memory. This is the literal, technical reality of the code.

Dramatically: the foundation from episode one is *visibly supporting* the growth in episode four. Carter can say: "The Xar grows from the pool. Every new segment comes from the same Piscina we built in week one." Marcus's engineering instinct grasps this instantly — of course the aqueduct system supports the buildings that connect to it. Of course the foundation bears the weight of what's built on top.

This is also the first time the audience sees a *dependency chain* in the code — Xar depends on Piscina. Library A uses Library B. The stack is building. Each episode adds a layer, and the layers interconnect. By 1x09 (XML), the audience will have internalized this architectural logic: trees need arrays (Xar) which need memory (Piscina), and structured text (XML) needs strings (Chorda) which also need memory (Piscina). The dependency graph IS the season's dramatic structure.

### 1x02 (Credo) -> 1x04 (Xar): Testing the Growth

Teal'c will be writing tests for the Xar. The Credo framework from 1x02 is the tool he uses. The testing philosophy from that episode — adversarial, edge-case-seeking, never finished — applies directly:

- What happens when the Xar is empty? (`xar_vacuum_est`)
- What happens at the exact boundary when a segment fills and a new one must be allocated?
- What happens when you ask for element -1? Element 10,000 when only 50 exist?
- What happens under load — adding three thousand elements, one for each citizen?

Teal'c's tests are the census of the census system — counting the edge cases, verifying the capacity, ensuring that the tool is worthy of the trust being placed in it. "A test that only confirms what you believe is a mirror" (1x02) — the Xar tests should include adversarial scenarios that try to break the growth mechanism.

### 1x03 (Chorda) -> 1x04 (Xar): Strings Live in Arrays

A census record is structured text — a citizen's name is a Chorda, their trade is a Chorda, their district is a Chorda. An array of census records is a Xar of structures that contain Chordae.

The layers visibly stack: Piscina (memory) -> Chorda (text) -> Xar (collection) -> Census (application). Lucia's lexicon from 1x03's tag — the dictionary of Latin computing terms — will need a new entry: *Xar*. She and Daniel will need to find the right word, and the word they chose (*Codex Tabulae Exponentialis*) tells us that the Romans understand this as a *ledger* — a growing book of records. Not an abstract data structure. A codex. A thing with a name and a nature.

---

## 6. GENRE ARCHITECTURE

### The Census as Biblical Infrastructure

As noted above, Luke 2:1 — the census that brought the Holy Family to Bethlehem. A show about Romans conducting a census on a world reached through a portal already lives in this resonance space. The writers don't need to flag it. It's simply there, the way the Nicene Creed was behind "Credo" — available for anyone who recognizes it, invisible to anyone who doesn't.

If we want to make the connection slightly more visible, Pliny is the character to do it through — a historian who knows that census records mark turning points. His line could be as simple as noting that every great Roman undertaking began with a census: roads, armies, colonies. "You cannot build what you have not counted."

### Roman Engineering as Dynamic Arrays

The Xar's growth-by-segments mechanism has a specific Roman engineering parallel: **the Roman road system.** Roads were built segment by segment, extending outward from Rome. Each segment was self-contained (its own surface, drainage, milestones), but connected to the previous segment. The network grew without redesigning existing roads. New provinces meant new road segments, not rebuilding the Via Appia.

Marcus would understand this instinctively. His metaphor: "You do not tear up the road from Rome to add the road to Brundisium. You extend."

The **insula** (Roman apartment block) is another parallel: Roman cities grew by adding insulae — multi-story residential blocks — to existing neighborhoods. Each insula was structurally independent but connected to the urban grid. Population growth was accommodated by adding new insulae, not by demolishing old ones to build larger structures. The Xar IS the digital insula.

The **Roman aqueduct system** extends the parallel further: when a city's water needs grew, Rome didn't replace existing aqueducts. They built additional ones. The Aqua Claudia didn't replace the Aqua Appia — it supplemented it. The old infrastructure remained. New capacity was layered on top. Eleven aqueducts by the 3rd century, all running simultaneously, each built for its era's needs. The Xar's segment array is Rome's aqueduct array.

### Genre Parallels

- **Foundation (Asimov):** The census is the psychohistorical database — you can't predict or prepare for the future without knowing the present in detail. Hari Seldon needed population data. Carter needs a census.
- **Babylon 5, "The Deconstruction of Falling Stars":** The episode that shows the Foundation being built across centuries. The census is the first brick. The data it generates will outlast everyone who compiled it.
- **Halt and Catch Fire, "The Way In":** The moment when infrastructure becomes community — when the technical system starts serving human relationships. The census does this: it turns "approximately three thousand people" into named, located, known individuals. The Xar's capacity to hold every citizen is the technical mechanism; the census is the human meaning.
- **Band of Brothers, "Points":** Counting soldiers, counting points, counting survivors. The census as military readiness assessment — O'Neill's version of the census is strategic. How many people do we have? What skills? What can they do? This is troop logistics.

---

## 7. SETUP FOR FUTURE EPISODES

### Seeds Planted in 1x04

**For 1x05 (Tabula Dispersa):** The census generates a LOT of data. Three thousand records. How do you find a specific citizen quickly? You can't scan the entire Xar every time. You need a way to *look things up*. The census creates the need for the hash table. Marcus, at the end of the episode, should voice this: "We can count them now. But finding one citizen among three thousand..." This is the perfect cliffhanger-question for 1x05 — the census works, but it's O(n) to search. Pliny, who has been searching his forty volumes by memory for eighty years, will feel this keenly.

**For 1x06 (Internamentum):** Many citizens share district names, trade names, family names. The census will contain thousands of repeated strings. "Faber" appears two hundred times. "Insula Prima" appears four hundred times. The waste is visible. This plants the need for string interning — canonical copies, compared by pointer. The Borg/interning parallel ("they assimilate, we intern") begins with the census's redundancy.

**For 1x08 (Horologium):** The census includes timestamps — when was each citizen last counted? When did the data change? But the clocks on Nova Roma don't agree with each other (the temporal anomaly). The census's timestamps are unreliable. Casey notices. This is the seed for the time library.

**For 1x18 (Arcanum/TLS):** Duncan's C4 beat — the census tells an enemy what you have to lose — plants the encryption need. If Kirk ever accesses the census, he has a complete inventory of Nova Roma's population, skills, and resources. The census must eventually be encrypted. Data at rest must be secured. The census is the first thing worth stealing.

### Open Questions for the Room

1. **Marcus or a Roman engineer for the rosary beat?** The season outline says "Marcus's engineers" but the scene works best with Marcus himself — it deepens the Marcus/Casey working relationship and gives Marcus a personal connection to faith-as-counting that could pay off in 1x11 ("Your gesture before we began. A prayer for success?"). If it's a lesser Roman, the thread is thinner.

2. **How explicit is the Xar/Kirk parallel?** Does anyone on the team SAY "Kirk is building his own version of what we're building"? Or is this purely for the audience? Carter's C2 observation ("He's building redundancy") gets close. Maybe that's enough — let the audience do the work.

3. **Duncan's flashback length.** The season outline says "a BRIEF memory — not the full Florence flashback." How brief? A single shot? A 30-second intercut? The beat works in as little as 10 seconds — a flash of stone walls going up, Duncan with a sword watching builders, then cutting back to present-day. The brevity IS the point: Duncan can recall building but can't dwell in it. Not yet.

4. **The census format.** Is the census output plain text (like the 1x03 report) or does it use the ChordaAedificator with indentation? Plain text continues the 1x03 precedent. Structured indentation shows the tools compounding. The aedificator approach is probably richer — it demonstrates that 1x03's builder is already being reused, which is the whole point of libraries.

5. **The "4/31" number.** Is 31 arbitrary or does it mean something? It could be: 31 major data centers on the US West Coast. Or 31 Stargate addresses Kirk has identified. Or something else entirely. The specificity is what matters — Kirk has a plan with a scope. The audience can speculate about the denominator.
