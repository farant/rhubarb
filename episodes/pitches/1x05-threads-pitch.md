## 1. CASEY'S FAITH BEAT: Pliny's First Question

### The Escalation

This is the biggest faith moment in the series so far. In 1x01, Casey crossed himself — no dialogue. In 1x02, the crucifix hung on his workbench — no dialogue. In 1x03-04, Marcus noticed the rosary — brief, warm, between two men who count things. But nobody has asked Casey about his *faith*. About the God behind the counting. About what the image on the wall *means*.

Pliny asks.

This is correct because Pliny is the character who treats everything as a subject of study. He has spent eighty years organizing the *Naturalis Historia Nova* — every plant, every mineral, every civic practice cataloged. Casey's faith is not an intrusion on Pliny's worldview. It's an undocumented entry in his encyclopedia. A gap in his records. And Pliny does not tolerate gaps.

### Placement

Two beats, separated by at least one act. The first is early — during the technical work of building the hash table, when the team is grappling with how to make Pliny's encyclopedia searchable. The second is later, after the major technical breakthrough, during a quieter moment when the weight of what they've built is sinking in.

### Beat 1: "What Does This Image Represent?" (Act 1-2, during technical work)

Pliny is in his element this episode — his encyclopedia is becoming searchable, his life's work gaining a new kind of permanence. He's watching the team work. He's also watching Casey.

The crucifix has been on Casey's workbench since 1x02. Pliny has seen it every day. He has not asked. He was waiting until he had the right question.

Pliny pauses near the workbench during a lull in the technical conversation. He's looking at the crucifix the way he looks at a new specimen — not with suspicion, but with scholarly attention. The same gaze he turns on an unfamiliar plant or an unusual mineral formation.

**PLINY:** This image. I have seen it on your wall since you arrived. What does it represent?

Casey looks at the crucifix. He's been asked this before — but not by an 80-year-old Roman polymath who genuinely wants to know the way he wants to know what kind of stone the forum is built from.

**CASEY:** A man who died for everyone.

**PLINY:** *(processing — this is a factual claim, and Pliny evaluates factual claims)* Willingly?

**CASEY:** Yes.

Pliny writes something down. Not much. A note in the margin of whatever he's working on. The way he writes down the properties of a new mineral — not because he believes in it, but because it has been observed and observation demands record.

He does not ask a follow-up question. Not yet. The polymath has opened a file. He will return to it.

**DIRECTION NOTE:** The writing-down is critical. It signals that Pliny is not reacting emotionally — he's *cataloging*. The crucifix has moved from "decoration" to "datum" in his classification system. This is how Pliny processes everything. It's also how the show processes the Catholic thread: by observation, not argument.

### Why Beat 1 Works Here

The hash table episode is about *finding things* — taking a vast collection (Pliny's encyclopedia) and making it searchable. Pliny is spending the entire episode watching his life's work gain the power of retrieval. He is thinking about knowledge, about how things are organized, about what deserves to be recorded. The crucifix has been sitting in his peripheral vision for four episodes. Today, the man who is building the infrastructure to *find* things finally decides to *look* at the thing on Casey's wall.

The hash table is also about *fingerprints* — the hash function reduces a thing to its essence, its identifying mark. When Pliny asks "What does this image represent?", he's asking for the hash of Casey's faith. Casey gives him the most compressed possible answer: "A man who died for everyone." That's the fingerprint. The full record is longer. Pliny will access the full record later. For now, the hash is enough to index it.

### Beat 2: "The God Who Remembers Everything" (Late Act 3 or Tag)

The archive is working. Pliny's encyclopedia is searchable. The team has built something that retrieves knowledge without losing any of it. Pliny should be celebrating — and he is, in his way. But there's a quietness to him.

The scene is set in the library or the workshop, late. Pliny and Casey. The others are elsewhere — celebrating, or finishing tests, or sleeping. Pliny is sitting with his scrolls. The new system hums nearby. Eighty years of knowledge, now retrievable.

**PLINY:** You have given my work a longer memory than I have.

**CASEY:** That's the idea.

**PLINY:** *(after a pause — looking at the scrolls, at the screen, at the decades of work around him)* I have spent eighty years trying to hold everything. Every plant I have named. Every mineral I have weighed. Every citizen I have counted. Every conversation I remember with someone who is now dead. *(beat)* The weight of it. Not the knowledge — the *memory*.

Casey waits. He recognizes the tone. This is not small talk.

**PLINY:** What do you do when the weight of memory becomes too heavy?

**CASEY:** I pray.

**PLINY:** To whom?

**CASEY:** The God who remembers everything.

Pliny sits with this. The scholar who has spent eighty years trying to record everything — and feeling the burden of that attempt — has just been told there is someone who *succeeds* where he fails. Not a system. Not a machine. A person.

**PLINY:** That... would be a considerable memory.

**CASEY:** *(the smallest smile)* Yeah.

**PLINY:** *(reaching for his notes — the same notebook he wrote in earlier)* I have more questions. But they can wait for another evening.

**CASEY:** I'm not going anywhere.

**PLINY:** *(writing, without looking up)* Good. I have been waiting eighty years for interesting answers. I can wait a few more evenings.

### Why Beat 2 Works Here

The archive episode is about the burden and the gift of comprehensive knowledge. Pliny has lived this burden longer than anyone. The hash table solves the *retrieval* problem — you can find anything. But it doesn't solve the *weight* problem — the sheer accumulation of knowing. The tabularium holds everything, but who holds the tabularium?

This is where Casey's faith offers something the technology doesn't. Not a solution. Not a system. A person. "The God who remembers everything" is the ultimate tabularium — not a hash table with collisions and load factors, but a memory that loses nothing and is burdened by nothing. Pliny, the empiricist, doesn't dismiss this. He evaluates it the way he evaluates everything: is this interesting? Is this worth studying? The answer is yes.

The scene also plants the first seed of Pliny's long-term engagement with Casey's faith. The outline tracks this through 1x09 (patronage/Mary), 1x14-16 (Pliny's numbered list of questions), and into S2-3 (where it becomes one of Pliny's last intellectual projects before his death in 3x20-21). This evening — "I have more questions. But they can wait" — is the beginning of a conversation that will last until Pliny dies. And the funeral Mass that Casey suggests for Pliny (3x20-21) will be the end of a thread that started here, with a crucifix on a wall and a scholar who decided to look.

### The Escalation Pattern (1x01-1x05)

| Episode | Faith Beat | Mode | Who Notices |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1x01 | Casey crosses himself before the mission | Visual only | Nobody (the audience) |
| 1x02 | Crucifix on Casey's workbench, framed with Data's green eyes | Visual + compositional | The camera (not characters) |
| 1x03-04 | Rosary tangles with stylus. Marcus: "What are those?" / "They help me count." | Brief verbal — about the *object* | Marcus (the counter) |
| **1x05** | **Pliny asks about the crucifix. Casey: "A man who died for everyone." Pliny writes it down. Then later: "The God who remembers everything."** | **Extended verbal — about the *faith*** | **Pliny (the scholar)** |

The progression is from silent to seen to touched to named to *inquired about*. Each episode moves one register closer to dialogue. 1x05 is the first time someone asks Casey what he *believes*, not just what his objects *are*. And the person asking is the most qualified questioner on Nova Roma — a man who has spent eighty years asking questions about everything.

## 2. KIRK STINGER: The Index

### Progression from 1x04

1x04's stinger ended on a map. Four pins. "4/31." Kirk building a network by adding nodes — the dark Xar, growth by accumulation.

1x05's A-plot is the hash table — the ability to *find* things quickly in a large collection. The transition from "we can store everything" (Xar) to "we can retrieve anything" (Tabula Dispersa). Storage to retrieval. Accumulation to access.

Kirk's stinger must mirror this transition. He's been accumulating — four nodes, growing toward thirty-one. Now he needs to *organize*. The network is getting large enough that brute-force management won't work. He needs indexing. He needs to find his people fast.

### The Scene

**Location:** Earth. Night. A different location from 1x04 — not the strip mall office, but something more established. A co-working space, after hours. The kind of place where startup founders grind through the night. Except the desks are too orderly. The screens all show the same shade of green.

Kirk stands before the whiteboard. The map from 1x04 is still there — five pins now. Portland. Seattle. San Francisco. The Pacific Northwest node. And a new one: Denver. The number has been updated: **5 / 31**.

But there's a second whiteboard. This one is new.

It's not a map. It's a *directory*. Names. Not the names of cities — the names of *people*. Organized not alphabetically, not chronologically, but by *function*. Categories. "Infrastructure." "Recruitment." "Signal Processing." "Material Acquisition." Under each category: names, locations, codes. A human hash table.

Kirk is indexing his network.

**KIRK:** *(to someone off-screen, studying the directory)* Portland has eleven in infrastructure, four in signal. San Francisco?

**VOICE:** Twenty-two infrastructure. Nine signal. Two material.

**KIRK:** *(writing, organizing)* When I need a signal processor on the West Coast, how quickly can you find one?

**VOICE:** Seconds.

**KIRK:** *(caps the marker, steps back, looks at the directory the way Pliny looks at a catalog — with the satisfaction of a man who can find what he needs)* Good. The network is useless if we can't navigate it.

He turns to the map. Traces a line from Denver to a blank space — somewhere east, somewhere new. The next node. But he doesn't add it yet. He looks at the directory first. Checks the categories. Calculates what he needs before he expands.

**KIRK:** We don't grow until we can manage what we have.

He writes one more thing on the directory board, in the upper right corner. Small. A label:

**TABULARIUM**

The camera holds on the word. Kirk's archive. Kirk's tabularium. The same word the episode used for the team's project. The same concept. The same problem. The same solution.

SMASH TO BLACK.

### Why This Works

The stinger rhymes with the A-plot at every level:

- **Structural:** The team builds a hash table to find citizens quickly in Pliny's records. Kirk builds a human directory to find operatives quickly in his network. Same problem (retrieval in a growing collection), same solution (organized indexing), opposite purpose.
- **The word:** Kirk labels his directory "TABULARIUM." The episode title is "Tabularium Novum." Two new archives. One serves a republic; the other serves an invasion.
- **The progression:** From storage to retrieval. 1x04's stinger was about accumulation — adding nodes, counting toward 31. 1x05's stinger is about organization — indexing what he has, making it navigable. Kirk has moved from Xar-thinking to Tabula-Dispersa-thinking. He's tracking the team's conceptual progression, one episode behind.
- **The discipline:** "We don't grow until we can manage what we have." This is Methos's maintenance question from 1x04 — "Does your growing array have a curator?" — answered by the villain. Kirk heard the question (metaphorically). Kirk built the curator.

### Kirk Stinger Progression (1x01-1x05)

| Episode | Stinger | Growth Stage | Computing Parallel |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1x01 | Kirk and Data arrive. Naked, vulnerable, alone. | Seed | First allocation |
| 1x02 | Kirk on a hill. Stolen laptop. Green cursor. First line of code. | Germination | First write |
| 1x03 | Kirk in a server farm. A guard doesn't remember stopping. | First root | First persistent storage |
| 1x04 | Kirk in a strip mall office. Four pins. 4/31. Workers with green screens. | First branches | First collection (Xar) |
| **1x05** | **Kirk before a directory board. Names organized by function. "TABULARIUM."** | **First organization** | **First index (hash table)** |

## 3. C-PLOT THREADING: Kirk / Midas / Temporal Anomaly

Following the established pattern of four woven C-plot beats:

### Beat C1 (Cold Open or Early Act 1): The Compass

This is the Midas temporal anomaly that the season outline flags as the primary C-plot for 1x05. It should land early — before the technical work begins — so it establishes an atmospheric unease that runs beneath the whole episode.

**Location:** The Forum Stellarum. Morning. Carter is setting up equipment for the day's work. She has a compass — an actual magnetic compass, one of the instruments she brought from Earth for basic surveying and orientation.

The compass is sitting on a stone ledge. Carter glances at it as she passes. The needle is pointing north. Normal.

She walks by again five minutes later. The needle is pointing east.

Carter stops. Picks it up. Taps it. The needle swings — not back to north, but in a slow, full rotation. 360 degrees. Then it stops. Points north again.

She looks around. Nothing unusual. The forum is waking up — Romans setting up for the day, the team arriving at the workshop. Midas is crossing the forum, heading toward Data's workstation with two cups of something hot.

The compass spins again as Midas passes. Carter sees it. Midas doesn't.

**CARTER:** *(to herself, very quiet, reaching for her notebook)* That's not magnetic variation.

She writes a note. Quick. Clinical. The physicist's instinct: observe, record, don't theorize yet. She doesn't tell anyone. Not yet. There's work to do today. But the notebook goes into her pocket, not onto the shelf.

**DIRECTION NOTE:** The compass is a recurring visual motif for the Midas temporal thread. It should appear in the background of future episodes — sometimes on Carter's desk, sometimes being checked. The audience will learn to watch it.

### Beat C2 (During Act 2): The Second Anomaly

The team is deep in the hash table work. Carter is at the center of it — explaining hash functions, working with Pliny on indexing the encyclopedia. But during a break, she steps outside.

She has the compass in her hand. She's been carrying it since the morning.

Midas is in the courtyard, talking to Data about something trivial — the weather, the food, whether Romans had a word for "debugging." The compass needle spins.

Carter marks Midas's approximate position. Then his distance from the compass. Then the time. She's building a data set.

**CASEY:** *(who has followed her out, noticed her distraction)* What are you looking at?

Carter considers. Casey is the longest-serving Immortal on the team — two hundred years. If anyone has noticed temporal strangeness on Nova Roma, it would be him.

**CARTER:** Have you noticed anything... off? With time? Here?

**CASEY:** *(careful)* The clocks don't always agree. I figured it was the equipment.

**CARTER:** It's not the equipment.

She puts the compass away. The conversation is over for now. But Casey's expression says: noted. Filed. He'll be watching too.

This plants the seed for 1x08 (Horologium/Tempus) — Casey trying to synchronize clocks on a world where time itself is bent.

### Beat C3 (Late Act 2 or Act 3): The Methos Reaction — The Black Stone Seed

This is the moment flagged in the season outline: "When the compass spins near Midas, Methos is in the background. His expression shifts — barely perceptible. He's seen temporal artifacts before."

**Location:** The workshop. The team is celebrating a successful test — the hash table is retrieving entries correctly, Pliny's encyclopedia is becoming searchable. Midas is present, laughing with Data about something. Carter checks the compass reflexively — yes, the needle is off. She notes it.

In the background: Methos. He's leaning against a pillar, wine cup in hand, his standard pose of studied indifference. But the camera catches something the characters don't.

Methos is watching Midas. Not the compass — Midas himself. And his expression shifts.

It's not surprise. It's not fear. It's *recognition*. Something very old waking up behind very old eyes.

The moment is three seconds long. Nobody sees it. The audience does.

Methos takes a drink. The expression vanishes. He says something dry and dismissive about the celebration — "You've built a filing system. The Romans invented those before your species invented shoes" — and the moment passes.

**DIRECTION NOTE:** This is a SEED, not a scene. It must be small enough to miss on first viewing and unmissable on rewatch. The audience who catches it will spend the next eight episodes (until the 1x13 Midas flashback) wondering what Methos recognized. The answer — he's seen temporal artifacts before, he's seen what they do to people, he watched the cults that formed around them — won't arrive until much later. The Cybele thread has its first thread in the present-day timeline.

**WHAT METHOS KNOWS (for the writers, not the audience):** Methos encountered the Black Stone — or something very much like it — in Alexandria's sub-chambers before the library fell. He saw what proximity to the stone did to people: temporal stuttering, aging anomalies, personality shifts. He saw the ecstatic cults that formed around these effects. He watched people worship what they didn't understand. Now he's watching Midas — an Immortal whose temporal signature bends compasses — and the feeling is horribly, anciently familiar. He doesn't speak because he doesn't know what to say. He doesn't know whether Midas is the source, the victim, or both. But he recognizes the *type* of thing this is, even if he can't name it yet.

### Beat C4 (Post-climax or pre-Tag): Kirk's Infrastructure

A brief scene. O'Neill and Duncan, reviewing intelligence reports in a quiet moment after the main work is done.

**O'NEILL:** NSA picked up another distributed signal. This one was routed through seven cities.

**DUNCAN:** Seven? Last time it was three.

**O'NEILL:** Kirk's expanding faster than we expected. Whatever he's building, he's getting organized about it.

**DUNCAN:** Organized how?

**O'NEILL:** The signals aren't random anymore. They're categorized. Different frequencies for different message types. He's built a routing system.

Duncan absorbs this. A routing system means hierarchy. Hierarchy means management. Management means Kirk is past the "recruit everything that moves" phase and into the "build a functional organization" phase. The same transition the team just made with the hash table — from "collect everything" to "organize for retrieval."

**DUNCAN:** He's not just growing. He's indexing.

**O'NEILL:** *(grim)* Same thing we did today. Except he's indexing people.

The dark mirror, made explicit by the characters for the first time. The team built a tabularium for knowledge. Kirk is building a tabularium for operatives. The same architecture. The same transition from Xar-thinking to hash-table-thinking. The villain is learning the same lessons at the same pace.

## 4. NOMINALISM / REALISM ANALYSIS: The Hash as Nature

### The Hash Function Is a Realist Operation

A hash function takes a thing and produces its *fingerprint* — a compressed representation that captures something essential about the thing's identity. FNV-1a, the hash function the team will likely implement, processes every byte of the key. Nothing is skipped. Nothing is ignored. The hash is computed from the *entirety* of what the thing is.

This is a realist operation. The hash says: this thing has a nature, and the nature can be captured (imperfectly, compactly) in a fixed-size representation. The fingerprint isn't arbitrary — it's *derived from what the thing is*. Change one byte of the key and you get a different hash. The hash *respects the nature of the key*.

The nominalist alternative would be: assign arbitrary labels. "This citizen is #47 because we put them in slot 47." The number tells you nothing about the citizen. It's a name that could be swapped with any other name. The hash function does something radically different: it computes the label from the nature of the thing itself. The citizen's name, their district, their trade — the hash *emerges from* who they are.

### How This Plays Dramatically

Pliny would understand this intuitively. He has spent eighty years classifying the natural world. When he catalogs a mineral, he doesn't assign it an arbitrary number — he describes its properties: color, weight, hardness, luster. The catalog entry is derived from *what the thing is*. The mineral's nature determines its classification. This is exactly what a hash function does: derive the classification from the nature.

**The moment:** When Carter explains hashing to Pliny — "The function reads the name, every letter, and produces a number that is unique to that name" — Pliny should nod with the recognition of a man who has been doing this his entire life. "You are describing what a naturalist does. We read the specimen. We produce a classification. The classification follows from the specimen, not the other way around." Carter: "That's... exactly right."

This is moderate realism as algorithm design. The classification scheme is real — grounded in the natures of the things it classifies. It's not imposed from outside (nominalism) and it's not a separate Platonic form (extreme realism). It emerges from careful attention to what the thing actually is.

### Collisions as Philosophical Dilemma

The hash table's central problem: collisions. Two different things can produce the same hash. This is unavoidable in any finite hash space.

The nominalist interpretation of collisions: "The hash is arbitrary. It doesn't capture real nature. Two different things producing the same hash proves the hash is just a label — the connection between hash and thing is conventional, not intrinsic."

The realist interpretation: "The collision is a limitation of the *representation*, not evidence against the *nature*. Two citizens may hash to the same bucket, but they are still different people. We resolve the collision by looking *more closely* — comparing the actual keys, examining the actual natures. The collision doesn't make the hash meaningless. It makes it *insufficient for this case*. We handle the insufficiency by going deeper, not by giving up."

**The dramatic beat:** When the first collision occurs in testing — two encyclopedia entries hashing to the same bucket — Teal'c should frame it as a test case, not a failure:

**TEAL'C:** Two entries share a location. The system must distinguish them.

**CARTER:** We compare the full keys. If the hashes match but the keys don't, we probe to the next slot.

**PLINY:** *(who has been watching)* When two specimens appear identical, I examine them more closely. I do not declare them the same merely because they share one property.

This is the realist method: when surface classification fails, go deeper. Examine more properties. Never conclude that two things *are* the same just because they *appear* the same at one level of analysis. The Borg make exactly this error — they see functional equivalence and conclude ontological identity. Two beings that perform the same function must be the same being. Therefore: assimilate.

### The Borg Hashing

Kirk's stinger should implicitly mirror this: he categories his operatives by *function*, not by identity. "Infrastructure." "Signal Processing." "Recruitment." The operative's name doesn't matter — their function does. This is the nominalist hash: reduce the person to their utility. Two infrastructure operatives are interchangeable. The hash that Kirk computes is not FNV-1a-over-the-full-key — it's a single-property reduction. What do you *do*? Not who you *are*.

Contrast with Marcus's census (1x04): every citizen is counted *as a person*. Name, family, trade, district — the full record. The hash of a citizen should be computed over their *name* (who they are), not their *function* (what they do). This is a design decision the team can discuss on screen, and it's philosophically loaded.

## 5. THE BLACK STONE SEED: Methos's Recognition

(Detailed above in C-Plot Beat C3. Summary placement here for thread tracking.)

### Placement
Late Act 2 or early Act 3. During the celebration of a successful hash table test. Background of a group scene.

### Description
Methos sees the compass spin near Midas. His expression shifts — three seconds of ancient recognition, masked immediately. Nobody notices. The audience does.

### What It Sets Up
- **1x06 (Internamentum):** Methos's Alexandria revelation. When Daniel presses about the Library, Methos's memory flashes: a sub-chamber, a priestess, a black stone, ecstatic rites. The seed from 1x05 retroactively gains weight.
- **1x13 (Aurum):** The full Midas flashback. Phrygia. The Black Stone. The Cybele cult. The audience sees what Methos already suspects.
- **1x17 (Quinque Milia Annorum):** Methos's own flashback — the lost library's sealed chamber. "A stone. Black. Dense. The priests who guarded it said it whispered to them." Two stones. One thread. The audience connects Midas's origin and Methos's memory.

### Thread Arc for Attentive Viewers

| Episode | Black Stone Beat | What the Audience Learns |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **1x05** | **Methos reacts to compass near Midas** | **Something about Midas disturbs Methos. First present-day clue.** |
| 1x06 | Methos flashes to Alexandria — a stone, a cult, a sub-chamber | There was *something* in Alexandria. Something old and wrong. |
| 1x13 | Midas flashback — the Phrygian stone, the Cybele priests, temporal instability | The stone is identified. It changed Midas. It's from Phrygia. |
| 1x17 | Methos flashback — "a stone, black as night, that the priests guarded" | TWO stones, or the same stone traveling? Methos's library stone and Midas's Phrygian stone. |

## 6. THEMATIC NOTES: "Tabularium Novum"

### Title Shift Across the Episode

Like every title in the series, "Tabularium Novum" shifts meaning as the episode progresses:

- **Cold Open / Act 1:** "The New Archive" = the literal problem. Pliny has forty volumes of the *Naturalis Historia Nova*, plus eighty years of census data, plus civic records, legal precedents, agricultural reports. Everything is *stored* but nothing is *findable*. He remembers where things are because he has an 80-year-old human memory. When he dies, the index dies with him. Nova Roma needs a new archive — not a new place to keep things, but a new way to *find* things. The archive that can survive the archivist.

- **Act 2:** "The New Archive" = the hash table. The computational solution. A *tabularium* — in Roman civic architecture, the building at the edge of the Forum where public records were kept. But this tabularium doesn't just hold records. It *indexes* them. You give it a name, it gives you a location. Instantly. The archive has learned to navigate itself.

- **Act 3:** "The New Archive" = the transition from 1x04's census to 1x05's retrieval. The census (1x04) counted everyone — *stored* them in the Xar. The archive (1x05) makes them *findable*. The census asked: "Who is here?" The archive answers: "Where is everyone?" These are complementary questions. You can't search what you haven't counted, and counting is useless if you can't search. The census is the foundation; the archive is the building that stands on it.

- **Stinger:** "The New Archive" = Kirk's tabularium. His directory of operatives by function. His new archive. The word on the whiteboard. The enemy builds his own archive from the same insight: storage without retrieval is a pile, not a system.

- **Meta:** "The New Archive" = the show's growing memory. Five episodes in, the audience is accumulating: characters, relationships, technologies, threats, open questions (what's wrong with Midas? what's Kirk counting toward? what does Methos recognize?). The show itself is a tabularium — and the threads are the hash functions that let the audience index what they know. The Catholic thread connects Casey/Pliny/Marcus. The Kirk thread connects the stingers. The Black Stone thread connects Midas/Methos/the compass. Threads are retrieval mechanisms for a growing archive of story.

### The Archive and the Archivist

The episode's emotional core is the question: *what happens to knowledge when the knower dies?*

Pliny is eighty years old. He is mortal in a show full of Immortals. His encyclopedia exists because he remembers where everything is — not just physically, but conceptually. He can cross-reference mineral properties with agricultural uses with historical precedents because the cross-references live in his mind.

The hash table doesn't replace Pliny's knowledge. It *encodes his organizational principle* into something that survives him. This is what makes the hash table different from a mere database: it captures *how to find things*, not just *what things are*. Pliny's genius was never the facts — it was the filing system. The hash table is the filing system made immortal.

This is the most generous gift the team can give a mortal collaborator: making his organizing intelligence permanent. The parallel to 1x04, where Pliny said "A census that depends on one old man's hand is a census that dies when the old man does," is exact. The hash table is the second step in making Pliny unnecessary — and the kindness of that, the way it honors him by freeing his successors from dependency on him, is the same kindness he identified in 1x04.

It also sets up Pliny's death (3x20-21) with devastating precision. When Pliny dies, the tabularium will still work. His encyclopedia will still be searchable. The filing system will outlive the filer. He knew it would. He helped build it that way. That is the scholar's version of Immortality — not of the body, but of the method.

### Connection to Previous Episodes

**1x01 (Piscina) -> 1x05 (Tabula Dispersa): Memory Feeds the Index**

The hash table allocates its buckets from the Piscina, just as the Xar did. Every new computational structure draws from the same memory pool. The dependency chain is growing:

```
Piscina (memory)
  -> Chorda (text, 1x03)
  -> Xar (collection, 1x04)
  -> Tabula Dispersa (index, 1x05)
```

The audience should feel the accretion. The foundation laid in episode one is supporting more and more weight. Marcus's 1x04 line — "The first mile of road is still there" — applies: the Piscina from 1x01 is still running, still allocating, still underneath everything.

**1x02 (Credo) -> 1x05: Testing the Hash**

Teal'c will test the hash table with the same adversarial rigor he brings to everything. But hash tables introduce a new kind of failure: the collision. A test that passes with ten entries might fail with ten thousand — not because the code is wrong, but because the hash distribution degrades under load. Teal'c's tests should exercise this:

- Insert entries. Retrieve them. VERITAS.
- Insert entries that collide (same hash, different keys). Retrieve both. VERITAS.
- Fill the table past its load factor. Verify it resizes correctly. VERITAS.
- The adversarial edge: what happens when *every* entry hashes to the same bucket? The degenerate case. The hash table becomes a linked list. Performance collapses. Does the system handle it? Does it warn?

Teal'c: "A system that works only under ideal conditions is not a system. It is a demonstration."

**1x03 (Chorda) -> 1x05: Strings as Keys**

The keys in the hash table will be Chordae — the length-prefixed strings from 1x03. This matters because the hash function processes every byte of the key, and a Chorda knows its own length. No null terminator to scan for. The hash function can process exactly the right number of bytes — no more, no less. The Chorda's realist self-knowledge (it knows its own length) enables the hash function's realist computation (it processes exactly what exists).

If the team had used null-terminated strings, the hash function would need to scan for the terminator — adding fragility (what if the terminator is missing?) and coupling the hash to the string's representation. The Chorda's design makes the hash robust. 1x03's decision pays forward into 1x05. This is the library dependency chain working as intended.

**1x04 (Xar / Census) -> 1x05: From Counting to Finding**

The most direct connection. The 1x04 census counted three thousand citizens. Now someone asks: "Find me Marcus Ferrarius." Without the hash table, the answer is: scan all three thousand entries. With the hash table: compute the hash of "Marcus Ferrarius," go directly to the bucket. O(1).

This is the transition from *having* knowledge to *navigating* knowledge. The census was the first step; the archive is the second. A civilization that has counted its people but can't find a specific citizen is a civilization that's doing paperwork, not governing. The hash table turns the census from a record into a tool.

Marcus should feel this keenly — he built the census. He knows it's complete. But completeness without retrieval is what Pliny has been living with for eighty years: forty volumes, everything recorded, nothing findable except through the old man's memory. Marcus doesn't want to build another Pliny-dependent system. He wants the system to find things on its own.

### Setup for Future Episodes

**For 1x06 (Internamentum/String Interning):** The hash table will contain many duplicate keys — the same district name ("Forum"), the same trade ("Faber"), the same common names. Each duplicate is a separate Chorda allocation. The waste is visible: why store "Faber" two hundred times when you could store it once and point to it? This is the motivation for string interning. The hash table creates the problem that interning solves.

Also: the Borg/interning parallel. "They assimilate, making everything identical. We intern, making things canonical while preserving their source." The hash table's duplicate keys are the setup for this distinction — many instances of "Faber" are still individual citizens who happen to share a trade. Interning the string doesn't merge the citizens. It just gives them a shared, canonical name. The people remain distinct. The label is unified. This is the anti-Borg position: shared vocabulary, sovereign identity.

**For 1x07 (Filum/File I/O):** The hash table holds data in memory. Memory is volatile — lose power, lose everything. The archive must be *saved*. The need for file I/O emerges from the need to persist the tabularium. Pliny, who has lost scrolls to fire and water (Joe will tell a parallel story in 1x07), understands this: "An archive that lives only in the machine is an archive that dies with the machine."

**For 1x08 (Horologium/Tempus):** Carter's compass observations — the timestamp of each anomaly, the position of Midas, the duration of the spin — become data points that need time-accurate recording. But the clocks on Nova Roma don't agree. Casey noticed in Beat C2. The time library emerges from the need to trust timestamps.

**For 1x13 (Aurum/Midas Flashback):** The compass seed, Methos's recognition, and Carter's quiet data-gathering all point toward the Midas temporal mystery. By 1x13, the audience has accumulated enough clues across eight episodes that the Phrygian flashback doesn't come from nowhere — it answers questions that have been building since 1x05.

## 7. BACKWARD AND FORWARD CONNECTIONS

### Backward: What the Audience Has Accumulated

By episode 5, the audience's own "tabularium" contains:

**Technical Stack:**
- Piscina (memory) -> Chorda (text) -> Credo (testing) -> Xar (collections) -> **Tabula Dispersa (indexing)**
- Each layer depends on the previous ones. The dependency chain is the season's spine.

**Character Knowledge:**
- Carter: the architect. Increasingly burdened (Midas compass, Kirk's signal, time away from Earth).
- Casey: the craftsman. Faith thread deepening. Two hundred years of patience.
- Marcus: the engineer who became a leader. First Roman to type code, first to present to the senate.
- Pliny: the mortal among immortals. The man whose memory must be encoded before it's lost.
- Teal'c: the freed slave who tests everything. Learning Latin (unrevealed). Watching code comments.
- Duncan: the swordsman who chose to stay. The cathedral flashback still resonating.
- Data: the outsider accepted. "Peregrinus amicus." Growing friendship with Midas.
- Methos: the sardonic observer. Hiding something about what he's seen.
- Midas: the cheerful anomaly. Something is wrong with time around him.
- Kirk: the shadow. 5/31 and growing. Moving from accumulation to organization.

**Open Threads:**
- What's wrong with Midas? (Compass, 1x05. Will pay off in 1x13, fully in 2x11-13.)
- What does Methos know? (His reaction, 1x05. Will pay off in 1x06, 1x17.)
- What is Kirk building toward? (4/31 -> 5/31. Escalates through the season.)
- How does Casey's faith interact with Nova Roma? (Pliny's questions begin, 1x05. Through the series.)
- Why don't the clocks agree? (Casey's observation, 1x05. Pays off in 1x08.)

### Forward: What 1x05 Enables

**1x06 (Internamentum):** The hash table's duplicate keys create the need for interning. The hash function itself is *used* by the interning system — intern strings by hashing them, storing canonical copies, comparing by pointer. 1x05's technology is 1x06's infrastructure.

**1x07 (Filum):** The tabularium must be saved to disk. Pliny's fear — an archive that dies with the machine — motivates file I/O.

**1x08 (Horologium):** Carter's timestamp data needs reliable time. Casey's observation needs confirmation. The compass needs a clock.

**1x09 (XML/Trees):** Pliny's *Naturalis Historia* isn't just a flat list — it's a hierarchy. Minerals within rocks within geology within nature. The hash table indexes flat records; the tree structures the relationships between them. The hash table is the index at the back of the book; the XML tree is the table of contents.

**1x13 (Aurum):** The compass seed, Methos's recognition, and eight episodes of accumulated temporal clues converge in the Midas flashback. The audience has been building their own hash table of clues. 1x13 is when they find the entry they've been indexing toward.

**1x15 (TCP/Networking):** Pliny and Casey's evening conversation — "I have more questions. But they can wait for another evening" — pays forward to 1x15's extended Pliny/Casey faith dialogue: "You say your god became a man... the only claim where the witnesses gained nothing by lying." The thread from 1x05 to 1x15 is Pliny's ten-episode study of Casey's faith, conducted with the same rigor he brings to his encyclopedia.

**3x20-21 (Pliny's Death):** The tabularium survives the archivist. Pliny dies. The hash table still works. The encyclopedia is still searchable. His method endures after his body doesn't. And Casey suggests a funeral Mass — closing the loop that opened in 1x05 when Pliny first looked at the crucifix and decided it was worth studying.

## APPENDIX: Thematic Cross-Reference

| Theme | A-Plot (Hash Table) | B-Plot (Pliny/Casey) | C-Plot (Kirk/Midas) | Faith Beat |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------| ----------|
| **Finding** | Hash table: find any entry instantly | Pliny finding an undocumented subject (Casey's faith) | Carter finding temporal anomalies; Kirk finding/organizing his operatives | Casey finding peace under the weight of memory |
| **Fingerprint** | Hash = fingerprint of data | "A man who died for everyone" = fingerprint of the faith | Compass spin = fingerprint of temporal disturbance | The crucifix as fingerprint — the compressed symbol of an entire theology |
| **Archive** | The tabularium: organized knowledge | Pliny's life as an archive; the fear that the archive dies with the archivist | Kirk's directory: the dark tabularium | "The God who remembers everything" — the ultimate archive |
| **Collision** | Two keys, same hash, resolved by deeper comparison | Two worldviews (Roman polytheism, Catholic monotheism), same curiosity, resolved by deeper conversation | Two archives (Nova Roma's and Kirk's), same technology, resolved by purpose | — |
| **Survival** | The index outlives the indexer | Pliny's method outlives Pliny | Kirk's network outlives any individual node | The faith outlives the century |

## APPENDIX: Thread Status After 1x05

| Thread | Status After 1x05 | Next Beat |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Casey's Faith | **ESCALATED.** First direct faith conversation. Pliny has opened a file. Two beats: the factual ("A man who died for everyone") and the personal ("The God who remembers everything"). | 1x07-08: Casey says grace. O'Neill notices. |
| Kirk Stinger | **5/31.** Kirk has moved from accumulation to organization. His directory mirrors the team's hash table. "TABULARIUM" on the whiteboard. | 1x06: Further expansion. The directory grows. |
| C-Plot (Kirk/Earth) | Kirk's signals now categorized by type. He's building routing. The team notices. | 1x06: Tech company acquisitions. Duncan recognizes Kirk's pattern. |
| Black Stone / Cybele | **SEEDED.** Methos reacted to the compass near Midas. The audience has their first present-day clue. | 1x06: Methos's Alexandria flash — a sub-chamber, a priestess, a black stone. |
| Midas Temporal | **SEEDED.** Compass spinning. Carter taking notes. Casey noting clock disagreements. | 1x06: More anomalies. 1x08: Full clock episode. 1x13: The explanation. |
| Nominalism/Realism | **DEEPENED.** The hash function as realist classification — deriving identity from nature. Collisions as the limits of representation, not evidence against nature. Kirk's functional categorization as nominalist hashing. | 1x06: Interning as anti-assimilation. Canonical without identical. |
| Pliny's Mortality | **IMPLICIT.** "I have been waiting eighty years for interesting answers." The tabularium survives the archivist. Pliny is building the system that will outlast him. | Ongoing through S1-3. Peaks at 3x20-21 (death). |
