## 1. CASEY'S FAITH THREAD: The Grace Scene

### The Setup

Pliny hosts a dinner at his villa to celebrate the successful interning of the census and encyclopedia. This is the first time the full team has gathered for a *social* meal rather than a working session. Pliny has prepared a Roman dinner — not lavish (he's a scholar, not a senator), but generous. Wine from local vineyards. Bread. Olives. Roasted meat. The table is full.

The seating: Pliny at the head. Carter and Marcus together (their ritual is deepening). Daniel and Lucia. O'Neill and Duncan. Casey. Methos, leaning, wine already in hand. Data and Midas together. Teal'c. Joe Dawson — new arrival, seated next to Pliny because the two documentarians have already been talking for hours.

### The Beat

Everyone is seated. Pliny raises his cup to begin — and Casey bows his head. Brief. Quick. His lips move. Three seconds. He crosses himself and looks up.

The camera catches O'Neill watching. Not staring — his eyes happen to be on Casey. O'Neill's a military man; he catalogs everything. He doesn't react. He picks up his wine.

No one else comments. The meal begins.

### The O'Neill Follow-Up

Later. The walk back from Pliny's villa. O'Neill falls into step with Duncan.

**O'NEILL:** Did Casey just pray over Roman food?

**DUNCAN:** He prays over everything.

**O'NEILL:** *(beat)* Huh.

That's it. Four lines. But the thread has turned a corner: O'Neill is now in the "Who Notices" column. He's military intelligence. He notices things. He files them. He doesn't act on them until they matter. This is how O'Neill processes: quiet observation → catalog → deploy when relevant.

### Why O'Neill

O'Neill is the right noticing character here because:
- **Pliny** (1x05) noticed as a scholar — curious, analytical, wanted to understand
- **O'Neill** notices as a strategist — not curious about Casey's faith, but now aware of it as a *fact about a team member*
- O'Neill doesn't judge and doesn't probe. "Huh" is his complete emotional response. But it means he's filed it. When Casey's faith becomes relevant to a mission or a crisis (1x11-12), O'Neill won't be surprised.

### Escalation Table Updated

| Episode | Faith Beat | Mode | Who Notices |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1x01 | Crosses himself | Visual only | Nobody |
| 1x02 | Crucifix + Data visual rhyme | Visual + compositional | Camera |
| 1x03-04 | Rosary / "What are those?" | Brief verbal — about object | Marcus |
| 1x05 | Two extended beats | Extended verbal — about faith | Pliny |
| 1x06 | Crucifix in frame | Visual — compositional REST | Nobody |
| **1x07** | **Grace before meal** | **Brief verbal — about practice** | **O'Neill** |

The pattern: escalation → rest → re-engagement. After 1x05's twin peaks and 1x06's deliberate rest, 1x07 re-engages at a moderate level. Grace before a meal is one of the most recognizable Catholic practices — the audience gets it instantly. The O'Neill "Huh" is the gentlest possible expansion of the circle. We're two-thirds through the first half of the season and the thread has moved from "nobody sees" to "the team commander has noticed." That's a lot of distance covered with almost zero dialogue spent on it.

## 2. KIRK STINGER: First Persistence

### The Progression So Far

| Stinger | Kirk's Step | Mirror Library | Number |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| 1x01 | Seed | — | — |
| 1x02 | Germination (laptop, first code) | — | — |
| 1x03 | First root (server farm) | Chorda | — |
| 1x04 | First branches (strip mall, 4/31) | Xar | 4/31 |
| 1x05 | First organization (directory, 5/31, "TABULARIUM") | Tabula Dispersa | 5/31 |
| 1x06 | First standardization (style guide, 6/31, "LEXICON") | Internamentum | 6/31 |
| **1x07** | **First persistence (backup, archives, 7/31, "ARCHIVUM")** | **Filum** | **7/31** |

### The Stinger

**Location:** Earth. Night. An unmarked building. No signage. The exterior is deliberately forgettable — industrial park, beige walls, small parking lot.

Inside: a server room. But not a modern cloud data center. This is older, heavier. Rack-mounted drives. Physical media. Tapes. Hard disks in caddies. The aesthetic is storage, not computing. This room exists to *remember*.

Kirk stands at a console. He's alone. No aides, no polo-shirt drones. Just Kirk and the drives.

On screen: a backup running. The data being saved isn't business records. It's *everything*. Personnel files on every acquisition target. Communication logs from every "aligned" contact. The lexicon from 1x06, now backed up. The organizational chart, now persisted.

**KIRK:** *(watching the progress bar)* They build in memory. Everything they've made — the arena, the strings, the hash tables, the interning system — lives and dies with the machine. If the machine stops, it's gone.

He opens a cabinet. Inside: rows of labeled drives. Dates going back months.

**KIRK:** *(pulling a drive, examining it)* I don't build in memory.

He places a new drive into the rack. Labels it by hand. The handwriting is precise, military.

On the whiteboard behind him: **ARCHIVUM**.

Below it: **7 / 31**.

A new red dot on the map — somewhere in the Mountain West. The network continues to grow.

**KIRK:** *(to himself, almost gentle)* They'll learn this next. Saving things. Writing to disk. They'll celebrate when they do — "Look, we can persist data!" *(beat)* I've been persisting data since week one. The difference between us isn't capability. It's timing. They build carefully. I build *first*.

He locks the cabinet. Walks to the door. Turns back to look at the server room — his archive, his memory, his backup against loss.

**KIRK:** One language. One vocabulary. One archive. Everything backed up. Everything recoverable. *(beat)* Everything *mine*.

SMASH TO BLACK.

### What This Means

Kirk's stinger progression mirrors the team's library progression — but **ahead of them**. The team just built persistence in the A-plot. Kirk has had it since the beginning. This is the first time the stinger explicitly names the gap: Kirk is faster because Kirk doesn't document, doesn't test, doesn't build consensus. He just builds. The terrifying implication: the careful, consensus-based, test-driven approach the team uses is *better* but *slower*. Kirk's approach is worse — brittle, undocumented, authoritarian — but he's always one step ahead.

The **ARCHIVUM** label connects to the A-plot's theme: wax tablets vs. stone. Kirk's persistence is the dark version — data saved not for posterity but for power. The team saves to preserve knowledge. Kirk saves to preserve *control*.

Kirk stinger progression updated: seed → germination → root → branches → organization → standardization → **persistence**.

## 3. C-PLOT BEATS

### Beat C1 (Early Act 1): Joe's Arrival + O'Neill Briefing

**Location:** The gate. Morning. Joe Dawson arrives.

Joe comes through the gate the way Joe does everything — looking around, taking mental notes, already categorizing. He has a guitar case on his back and a cane in his hand. He doesn't look like a spy. He looks like a folk musician on vacation.

**O'NEILL:** *(meeting him)* You're Dawson?

**JOE:** *(looking around at Nova Roma)* In the flesh. *(beat)* You don't look happy to see me.

**O'NEILL:** The Watchers have been "observing" Immortals for centuries. Now you want to observe here.

**JOE:** I'm a bartender, Colonel. I'm here to open a bar. *(beat)* If I happen to observe things while I'm pouring drinks, that's just... professional curiosity.

**O'NEILL:** *(studying him)* Duncan vouches for you.

**JOE:** Duncan's a good judge of character.

**O'NEILL:** He's a terrible judge of character. He trusts everybody. But you're here anyway.

Joe scans the environment — the villa, the computing equipment, the Romans. His eyes settle on Data working at a terminal. Then on Midas, walking through the Forum with a basket of herbs.

**JOE:** *(under his breath)* That's a lot of uncharted Immortals.

**O'NEILL:** *(sharp)* They're not your subjects.

**JOE:** No. But they've got stories. And stories should be recorded.

This beat establishes: Joe is a Watcher, O'Neill is wary of Watchers, Duncan's trust is the bridge. Joe's motivation — recording stories — will intersect with the episode's theme (persistence/preservation) immediately. He and Pliny will recognize each other within minutes.

**O'Neill pulls Joe aside before releasing him:**

**O'NEILL:** One thing. We have a situation. An Earth-side situation. You might know something useful.

**JOE:** What kind of situation?

**O'NEILL:** We're tracking an organization. Kirk's network — you may not know the name, but you know the pattern. Systematic acquisition of assets. Standardized communications. Growing.

**JOE:** *(his Watcher instincts engaging)* Growing how?

**O'NEILL:** New city on the map every two weeks. Seven sites we know about, probably more. All legitimate-looking businesses. All connected.

Joe's Watcher intelligence background — decades of tracking Immortals through front companies, aliases, shifting identities — makes him a natural complement to O'Neill's military intelligence. The Watchers have been tracking covert networks for a thousand years. O'Neill has been doing it for twenty. Joe has institutional memory that O'Neill needs.

**JOE:** I might have some thoughts on that. But first — where's the bar going?

**Placement:** Between Beats 1-2, during the settling-in sequence.

### Beat C2 (During Act 2): Carter Saves Temporal Data

Carter has been accumulating compass readings, oscillation patterns, and electromagnetic measurements since 1x05. Two episodes of data on scraps, in notebooks, in her head.

Now she has file I/O.

**Location:** Carter's workstation. Late. The team is working on persistence. Carter is at her desk, and the first thing she does with the new Filum library isn't census data or encyclopedia backup. It's her secret.

```c
/* Aperire filum novum — datum temporale */
Filum* filum = filum_aperire(
    "temporalis_anomalia.dat",
    FILUM_MODUS_CREARE);
```

She writes her compass data to disk. Every reading. Every timestamp. The oscillation patterns. Data's eye-color shifts (noted as numerical measurements, clinical and precise).

She saves. The file exists. The data is persistent.

**CARTER:** *(staring at the file listing, alone)* There. Now it's real.

And then the implication hits her. Everything in memory was safe because it was *ephemeral*. If someone looked at her notes, the notes could be dismissed — half-observations, hunches, scribbles. A file on disk is different. A file can be found. A file can be read. A file is *evidence*.

She stares at the filename for a long beat. She doesn't delete it. But she doesn't feel safer. The secret has changed form — from ephemeral thought to persistent artifact. Carter's burden didn't lighten. It solidified.

**Placement:** During Act 3, intercut with the main implementation work. 45 seconds.

### Beat C3 (During Act 3-4): Joe and Pliny — Two Documentarians

The signature C-plot beat of the episode. Joe and Pliny have been circling each other since Joe's arrival. They meet properly for the first time at the villa dinner (the same dinner where Casey says grace).

But the REAL meeting happens after dinner. Pliny pulls Joe aside. Joe has found Pliny's archive — the indexed encyclopedia, now interned, soon to be persisted.

**PLINY:** You have the look of a man who writes things down.

**JOE:** *(laughing)* That obvious?

**PLINY:** I have spent eighty years looking for people who write things down. They are rarer than you think.

**JOE:** I've spent thirty years doing it. Watching. Recording. Never interfering. *(beat)* Well. Almost never.

**PLINY:** *(sitting, pouring wine)* Thirty years of observation. Of what?

**JOE:** People. Extraordinary people. People who live longer than they should. *(careful)* People who don't age.

Pliny sets down the cup. He looks at Joe with scholarly intensity.

**PLINY:** You are a documenter of the Immortals.

**JOE:** We call ourselves Watchers. We observe. We record. We don't interfere.

**PLINY:** *(with sudden passion)* You *must* interfere. A scholar who only observes is a mirror. Useful, but limited. A scholar who engages — who asks the question that provokes the insight — is a *lens*. You magnify what you study. You change it by looking.

**JOE:** That's been the argument for a thousand years.

**PLINY:** And what has a thousand years of non-interference produced?

**JOE:** *(long beat)* A lot of files. Some of them very good.

**PLINY:** I wrote forty volumes by going to places and asking questions and *touching* the things I described. Your order — these "Watchers" — they have the opposite instinct. They are scholars who fear corrupting their observations by participating. *(beat)* I think they are wrong.

**JOE:** *(quietly)* Yeah. So do I.

This is the scene that defines Joe's arc on Nova Roma. His Watcher training — observe, record, don't interfere — is the *nominalist* approach to documentation. Pliny's approach — go, look, touch, engage, organize, synthesize — is the realist approach. The same dichotomy playing out in two documentarians sitting together over wine. Joe's crossing over — from Watcher to participant — starts here.

**Placement:** Between Beats 15-16 (during the Act 3/4 transition), or as a Tag sub-beat.

### Beat C4 (Late): Daniel and Joe — The Methos File

Late night. Joe is settling into his quarters. Daniel finds him.

**DANIEL:** Joe. I need to ask you something. About Methos.

**JOE:** *(carefully)* What about him?

**DANIEL:** He told me something. About Alexandria. About being there. *(beat)* About something he found under the Library.

Joe goes very still. Joe knows Methos's history — or at least, the Watcher records' version of it. The Methos Chronicle is the longest, most incomplete, most contradictory file in the Watcher archive. Five thousand years of fragments.

**JOE:** The Methos Chronicle is... complicated. There are entries going back to the Bronze Age that may or may not be the same man. What specifically did he tell you?

**DANIEL:** A sub-chamber. A priestess. Artifacts. Cults that changed people. He stopped himself before he finished.

**JOE:** *(a long exhale)* There's a Watcher entry from roughly 280 BC. Alexandria. An observer noted that "a man matching prior descriptions" was seen in the vicinity of the Serapeum. The entry says — and I'm quoting from memory — "the subject appeared disturbed by something in the lower levels."

**DANIEL:** "Disturbed."

**JOE:** That's a Watcher understatement. The observer's margin note, which didn't make the official record, says: "Subject fled Alexandria within the week. First recorded instance of the subject voluntarily leaving a center of learning."

Daniel files this. A Watcher observer in 280 BC saw Methos leave Alexandria in a hurry after going below the Serapeum. Methos told Daniel about the sub-chamber in 1x06. The independent verification — Watcher records confirming Methos's story through a different lens — is a major thread escalation.

**DANIEL:** Can I see the Chronicle?

**JOE:** *(long pause)* Parts of it. The ones that are safe to share. *(beat)* The Methos Chronicle has killed three Watchers and driven two others to quit. It has that effect on people who read too much of it.

**Placement:** After Beat 19, in the Tag. 90 seconds. This beat connects the Methos/Alexandria/Black Stone thread to Joe's arrival and establishes that the Watcher records will be an intelligence resource for Daniel's investigation.

## 4. MIDAS TEMPORAL THREAD: Persistence Changes the Stakes

Carter saves her temporal data to disk (Beat C2 above). But there's a second Midas-related beat that should land in the episode:

### The Compass in Persistent Storage

Carter, having built the Filum library, runs her compass test again with Midas walking past. She records the result — not in a notebook this time, but directly to disk.

```c
filum_scribere(filum_temporale,
    &mensura, magnitudo(MensuraTemporalis));
```

The data writes. The reading is persistent. And Carter notices something she couldn't have noticed with intermittent handwritten measurements: the oscillation pattern isn't random. With persistent, timestamped data she can now see a *frequency*.

**CARTER:** *(to herself, staring at the output)* It's periodic. How did I not... *(beat)* I didn't have enough data points. You need continuity to see a pattern.

She doesn't share this. She saves it. Closes the file. But the audience now knows: Midas's temporal effect has a rhythm. A frequency implies something *regular* — not chaotic, not decaying, but structured. This is the first hint that the temporal anomaly isn't a random disturbance. It's a *signal*.

This seeds 1x08 (Horologium/Tempus) directly — Carter will need Casey's time library to properly analyze the frequency she's now detected.

---

## 5. NOMINALISM / REALISM: Persistence as Ontological Upgrade

The nominalism/realism thread in this episode operates through the file I/O theme:

### The Argument

**In memory:** Data exists only while the machine runs. It's contingent — dependent on power, on process, on someone paying attention. Stop the machine, the data vanishes. From a nominalist perspective, this is fine: data is just information in use. It has no independent existence. It IS its use.

**On disk:** Data persists independently. It exists whether anyone reads it or not. It endures beyond the machine that created it, beyond the process that wrote it, beyond the person who entered it. From a realist perspective, this is recognition: data has content — a nature — that deserves preservation independent of its use.

### How This Plays Dramatically

- **Pliny** grasps this immediately. His encyclopedia — written on papyrus, stored in scrolls — has always been persistent. "I write because what I observe deserves to endure beyond my observation." For Pliny, persistence isn't a feature. It's a moral obligation. Things observed *deserve* to be recorded.
- **The wax tablet metaphor** is the bridge. Wax tablets are *re-writable* — Roman schoolchildren wrote on wax, scraped it clean, wrote again. Stone inscriptions are *permanent*. The A-plot's FILUM_MODUS_CREARE (overwrite) vs. FILUM_MODUS_APPENDERE (append) maps directly: wax tablets overwrite (nominalist — data is temporary, in service of current use), stone inscriptions endure (realist — data has value beyond immediate use).
- **Joe's Watcher philosophy** adds a new dimension: the Watchers observe but don't engage (nominalist — the observation is the thing, the observer should be transparent). Pliny engages with his subjects (realist — the observation is of something real, engagement doesn't corrupt it, it enriches it). Their dinner conversation (Beat C3) dramatizes this without naming it.

### The Kirk Mirror

Kirk's stinger (Beat 2 above) is the nominalist version of persistence: data saved for *control*, not for *truth*. Kirk persists data so it can be *used* — recovered, deployed, weaponized. The team persists data so it can be *known* — preserved, studied, shared. Same operation. Different ontology.

---

## 6. JOE DAWSON AS THREAD INTERSECTION

Joe is this episode's new character. He intersects with virtually every running thread:

### Joe ↔ Duncan (Established)
Joe is Duncan's Watcher-turned-friend. Their relationship is the Highlander franchise's deepest bond outside of Duncan/Methos. Joe's arrival means Duncan has an ally who understands Immortal politics, who has institutional memory of the Watchers, and who can be trusted with secrets because he's spent thirty years keeping them.

### Joe ↔ Pliny (NEW — the big pairing)
Two documentarians. Different methodologies. Same passion. Pliny is the active researcher; Joe is the trained observer. Their dinner scene (Beat C3) is the episode's character highlight: Pliny challenges Joe's Watcher philosophy of non-interference, Joe recognizes that Pliny's approach is better, and the groundwork is laid for Joe's transformation from observer to participant. This also gives Pliny a peer — someone who *understands* the obsession with recording everything, even if they approach it differently.

### Joe ↔ O'Neill (NEW — intelligence asset)
O'Neill briefs Joe on Kirk (Beat C1). Joe's Watcher intelligence background — decades of tracking Immortals through aliases, front companies, and hidden networks — makes him O'Neill's most useful new intelligence resource. The Watchers have been tracking covert networks for a millennium. O'Neill's been doing it for decades. Joe has *institutional memory* that the military can't match.

### Joe ↔ Daniel (NEW — the Methos connection)
Daniel needs the Watcher records on Methos. Joe has the Methos Chronicle — the longest, most contradictory, most dangerous file in the Watcher archive. Their late-night conversation (Beat C4) establishes that the Watcher records independently corroborate Methos's Alexandria story: an observer in 280 BC noted Methos fleeing the city after visiting the Serapeum's lower levels. This is the first *independent verification* of Methos's fragments, and it opens the Watcher archive as a research resource for Daniel's investigation.

### Joe ↔ Methos (Background — deferred)
Joe and Methos have the most complicated relationship in the Highlander franchise. Joe was Methos's Watcher *and* friend. Methos has been hiding from the Watchers for centuries while simultaneously using Joe as his lifeline to the mortal world. In 1x07, they don't interact directly on screen — Methos is present at the dinner but doesn't seek Joe out. The audience who knows the Highlander series will feel the tension of their proximity without it being addressed. This pays forward to later episodes when Methos and Joe have their private conversation about what the Watcher records contain about the oldest man alive.

### Joe ↔ Midas (Seeded)
Joe sees Midas for the first time and his Watcher instincts fire: an Immortal he's never heard of, with no Chronicle, no record, no observed history. Three thousand years old and completely undocumented. For a Watcher, this is either the greatest find or the greatest failure in organizational history. Joe doesn't approach Midas in this episode, but he starts a file.

### Joe ↔ Casey (Seeded)
Joe is at the dinner when Casey says grace. Joe notices — he's a Watcher, he notices everything. He doesn't react. But the Nightcrawler approach works on Joe too: by the time Casey's faith becomes explicitly relevant (later in the season), Joe will have been watching it accumulate. Joe respects conviction. He's seen it in Duncan for thirty years.

---

## 7. BACKWARD AND FORWARD CONNECTIONS

### Backward Connections

**From 1x01 (Piscina):** The arena allocator enables all file I/O operations — data must be allocated in memory before it can be written to disk. The dependency chain deepens: Piscina → Chorda → Tabula Dispersa → Internamentum → **Filum**.

**From 1x02 (Credo):** Teal'c will write persistence tests. The test philosophy — "test reveals a property the system should have" — now includes: data written should survive machine restart. This is the first test that requires *temporal* validation (write now, read later).

**From 1x03 (Chorda):** Chorda data written to disk. The length-prefix pays off: when reading back from disk, the system knows exactly how many bytes to read. Null-terminated strings would need to scan for the terminator. Length-prefixed strings know their own size. The realist advantage, first dramatized in 1x03, makes persistence more reliable.

**From 1x04 (Xar):** Census data (stored in Xar arrays) can now be saved and loaded. The data structures built in 1x04 gain *durability*.

**From 1x05 (Tabula Dispersa):** Hash tables can be persisted — write the key-value pairs to disk, reconstruct the table on load. Pliny's searchable encyclopedia survives shutdown.

**From 1x06 (Internamentum):** Interned strings present a persistence challenge: pointer addresses change between sessions. The canonical copies must be re-interned on load. This is a technical complication that mirrors the philosophical point: identity in memory is cheap (pointer comparison), identity on disk requires re-verification (content comparison → re-interning). Persistence momentarily costs you the O(1) recognition; you have to re-earn it through re-examination.

**From 1x06 (Methos/Alexandria):** Daniel's fragments from Methos are now supplemented by Joe's Watcher records (Beat C4). Independent corroboration. The investigation thread gains a second source.

**From 1x06 (Carter/Midas):** Carter's temporal data moves from notebook to disk (Beat C2). The compass readings become persistent evidence. The oscillation pattern reveals a frequency. Seeds 1x08.

### Forward Connections

**To 1x08 (Horologium/Tempus):** Carter needs timestamps. The frequency she discovered in 1x07 requires precise timing to analyze. But the clocks disagree. Casey's time library (1x08) is motivated by making Carter's Filum data *temporally coherent*.

**To 1x09 (Arbor/XML):** Flat files are limited. Pliny's encyclopedia has structure — hierarchy, categories, relationships. The flat persistence of Filum needs structured persistence (XML trees serialized to disk). Joe's Watcher records also have hierarchy (subject → chronicle → entries → observations). The XML episode is motivated by the limitations of flat file I/O.

**To 1x13 (Aurum/Midas):** Joe opens a bar on Nova Roma (established in the season outline for 1x13). His arrival in 1x07 and his bond with Pliny lay the groundwork: Joe doesn't just run a bar, he builds a *place* — a nexus for the community, the way his Seacouver bar was for Immortals. Joe's bar is where information flows. Pliny's villa is where it's organized. The two documentarians build complementary institutions.

**To 1x17 (Quinque Milia Annorum):** The Watcher records Joe shares with Daniel (Beat C4) are the foundation of Daniel's investigation. By 1x17, Daniel will have cross-referenced Methos's fragments with Watcher observations spanning centuries. The independent verification from 1x07 is what gives Daniel the confidence to push Methos harder in 1x17.

**To S2 (Carter's Watcher Archive Use):** Joe's Watcher archives will eventually be digitized and searchable using the team's tools. The institutional memory of the Watchers — centuries of tracking Immortals — becomes a dataset. Carter will use it to trace the Black Stone's historical path, cross-referencing Watcher observations of the Cybele cult with Methos's and Daniel's archaeological findings.

---

## 8. OTHER ACTIVE THREADS: Status Updates

### Pliny's Mortality Thread
Pliny is 80. He has been energized since 1x05 (his encyclopedia searchable) and 1x06 (auto-cross-references, the intellectual triumph of interning). Now, in 1x07, his life's work can be *saved*. The mortality thread doesn't spike here — it DEEPENS. Every persistence operation Pliny witnesses is, for him, a small victory against death. His encyclopedia will outlast him. His observations will outlast the machine. For the first time, the digital work feels as permanent as the papyrus he spent eighty years writing on. This is background emotional coloring, not a scene. The audience who has been watching Pliny should feel it without it being stated.

### Data/Midas Friendship
Continues from 1x06's "friendship is external verification." In this episode, Data is present throughout the A-plot (helping with file I/O implementation), and Midas is present at the dinner. Their shared scenes are warm but brief — they sit together, they talk, they are two uninternable things being consistent for each other. The persistence theme adds a layer: Data can now *save* his observations of Midas's temporal effects. External verification becomes *documented* external verification. Files don't forget.

### Daniel as Investigator
ESCALATED. Daniel now has two sources: Methos's fragments (1x06) and the Watcher records via Joe (1x07 Beat C4). He is building a dossier. He saves it to disk — his notes, the cross-references, the timeline. The investigator now has persistent working files. This is both practical (he can pick up where he left off) and thematically resonant (the investigation becomes *real* when it's written down).

### Methos's Secret
Methos is present at the dinner. He watches Joe arrive and does not seek him out. The man who has been hiding from the Watchers for millennia is now sitting at dinner with his Watcher. Methos says nothing. But the audience who knows the Highlander franchise feels the tension. Additionally: Methos watches the team build persistence — the ability to save, to preserve, to make permanent. The man who watched Alexandria burn watches them learn to *back up*. His silent presence at the dinner, wine in hand, is the same register as his silent Tag in 1x06. The man who lost the greatest library in history watches them build the tools to prevent that loss from ever happening again. No dialogue needed. The composition says it.

### Carter's Secret Burden
CHANGED STATE. The burden was ephemeral (notes, observations, hunches). Now it's persistent (files on disk). Files can be found. Files can be read. Carter's secret burden has become more real — and more vulnerable to discovery. The beat in C2 dramatizes this: saving the data is both a relief (it won't be lost) and a risk (it can be found). The dual nature of persistence.

## THREAD STATUS APPENDIX: After 1x07

| Thread | Status After 1x07 | Next Beat |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Casey's Faith** | **RE-ENGAGED.** Grace before meal. O'Neill notices. "He prays over everything." "Huh." The observer circle expands to include the team commander. | 1x08-09: Rosary visible. Roman asks about beads. "It's a prayer. You count." / "How many?" / "Enough." |
| **Kirk Stinger** | **7/31. ARCHIVUM.** Kirk has been persisting data since the beginning. The team just caught up. Kirk's dark persistence: saving for control, not truth. | 1x08: Kirk's stinger mirrors the time library. What does Kirk do with timestamps? |
| **C-Plot (Kirk/Earth)** | **ACTIVE.** O'Neill briefs Joe. Joe's Watcher intelligence intersects with Kirk tracking. Joe brings institutional memory of tracking covert Immortal networks — a millennium of experience O'Neill can leverage. | Ongoing. Joe's intelligence contributions build through mid-season. |
| **Joe Dawson** | **INTRODUCED.** Arrives through gate. O'Neill wary, Duncan vouches. Pliny connection immediate and deep. Daniel gets Watcher corroboration of Methos's Alexandria story. Bar location scouted. | 1x08-12: Joe settles in. Bar construction. Pliny and Joe working sessions. By 1x13: bar opens. |
| **Black Stone / Cybele** | **SUPPLEMENTED.** Joe's Watcher records provide independent corroboration of Methos's Alexandria story (280 BC observation of Methos fleeing Serapeum). Daniel now has two sources. Investigation gains evidentiary weight. | 1x09 (XML): Daniel working with structured ancient texts. Cross-referencing Watcher records with archaeological data. |
| **Midas Temporal** | **FREQUENCY DETECTED.** Carter saves temporal data to disk. With persistent, timestamped data, she discovers the oscillation has a periodic frequency — not random, structured. This is a signal, not noise. | 1x08: Carter needs Casey's time library for proper frequency analysis. The discovery in 1x07 directly motivates 1x08's technical need. |
| **Nominalism / Realism** | **PERSISTENCE AS ONTOLOGY.** In memory = contingent existence (nominalist). On disk = independent existence (realist). Wax tablets (overwrite) vs. stone inscriptions (endure). Joe's Watcher philosophy (observe/don't engage = nominalist) vs. Pliny's scholarship (engage/participate = realist). Kirk persists for control (nominalist). Team persists for truth (realist). | Ongoing. Each library adds depth. |
| **Pliny's Mortality** | **DEEPENING.** His life's work can now outlast him — not just the machine but the session. Digital persistence mirrors his papyrus. Background emotional coloring, not explicit dialogue. | Ongoing. By 3x20-21, this thread pays off in the hardest way. |
| **Data/Midas Friendship** | **CONTINUING.** Warm, present, brief. Data can now document his observations of Midas persistently. External verification becomes documented verification. | Ongoing. The file Data keeps on Midas will matter when the temporal truth emerges. |
| **Daniel as Investigator** | **ESCALATED.** Two sources: Methos's fragments + Watcher records. Investigation saved to disk. Persistent working files. The dossier is real and growing. | 1x09: Structured text work. Cross-referencing. 1x13/1x17: The thread pays off. |
| **Methos's Secret** | **BACKGROUNDED.** Methos present at dinner, does not seek out Joe. The man hiding from the Watchers is sitting with his Watcher. Silent. Watching the team build persistence — the tool that would have saved Alexandria. | Ongoing. Joe's records will eventually push this thread forward when Daniel shows Methos what the Watchers saw. |
| **Carter's Secret Burden** | **STATE CHANGE.** Ephemeral → persistent. The compass data is on disk. Files can be found. The burden solidified. Relief and risk in equal measure. | 1x08: Carter needs timestamps. The persistent file demands temporal coherence. |
| **Joe/Pliny Partnership** | **NEW THREAD.** Two documentarians. Different methodologies (observer vs. participant). Deep mutual recognition. Pliny challenges Joe's Watcher non-interference philosophy. Joe begins his transformation from observer to participant. | 1x08-12: Working sessions. By 1x13: Joe opens the bar. The two build complementary institutions (bar for flow, archive for structure). |
