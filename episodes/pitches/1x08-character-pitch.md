## 1. CASEY'S FLASHBACK — THE NOMINALISM PROGRESSION (160 Years)

This is Casey's spotlight episode. The flashback is the spine. Four eras, each showing a step on the nominalist descent — not by naming it, but by living it.

### ERA 1: First Death — The Factory Floor (1858, Manchester, England)

Casey is a cobbler. Not a great cobbler, but a real one. He makes shoes for a neighborhood. He knows his customers' feet by memory. He has a workshop with tools he inherited from his master.

A factory opens across the street. It makes shoes too — five hundred pairs a day. The shoes don't fit anyone perfectly. They fit everyone adequately. Casey's customers begin to leave. Not because the factory shoes are better — they're worse. Because they're cheaper. Because "good enough" is enough when you're poor.

**KEY SCENE:** Casey stands in his empty workshop. A factory foreman offers him a job. "We need someone who knows leather." Casey: "I don't know leather. I know *feet*. I know Mrs. Callahan has a bunion on her left foot and Mr. Grady's right heel is a half-size larger than his left. That is what I know." The foreman: "We don't need that."

Casey walks out into the street. A carriage hits him. He dies.

He wakes up in the gutter, covered in blood, very much alive. A man across the street is watching — the first Immortal he meets. (We don't linger on this. We'll revisit the first teacher in a later season. The death is the beat, not the immortality.)

**THE NOMINALISM:** A cobbler makes shoes *for someone*. A factory makes shoes *as product*. The nature of the shoe changed — from something with an inherent relationship to a person, to something interchangeable. People became foot-shapes. Shoes became units. The cobbler who knew natures became unnecessary.

**CASEY'S LINE (present-day, reflecting):** "A cobbler makes shoes. A factory worker operates a machine. They stopped being something and started being interchangeable."

**Dramatic function:** Establish Casey's first wound — watching craft die. Establish his mortality (he actually dies). Establish that his instinct, from the very beginning, was to know *particular* things, not general categories.

### ERA 2: The Efficiency Lecture (1911, Philadelphia)

Casey in a lecture hall. Frederick Winslow Taylor is presenting "The Principles of Scientific Management." Taylor is charming, persuasive, completely certain.

Taylor's thesis: every human motion can be measured, optimized, reduced. The shoveler should not choose his own shovel — management should determine the optimal shovel, the optimal angle, the optimal number of shovelfuls per minute. The worker becomes a function. The function has inputs and outputs. The person is irrelevant.

Casey watches the audience nodding. Engineers. Managers. Industrialists. They are fascinated. They are taking notes. They see efficiency. Casey sees something else.

**KEY SCENE:** Taylor demonstrates with a volunteer — timing him with a stopwatch, correcting his posture, adjusting his grip. The audience applauds. Casey stands. He doesn't make a speech. He walks out. The door closes behind him. Taylor doesn't notice.

*In the lobby, Casey looks at the printed program. The subtitle reads: "The One Best Way." He drops it in the trash.*

**THE NOMINALISM:** Taylorism reduces a person to a function — inputs, outputs, optimal parameters. The nature of the worker is irrelevant; only the measurable performance matters. The person IS the measurement. This is nominalism applied to human beings. Things don't have natures; they have metrics.

**DRAMATIC NOTE:** We seed the eugenics connection WITHOUT stating it. Taylor's language — "optimal," "efficient," "measurement as the basis for all decisions" — echoes language the audience will recognize from darker applications. The show plants the seed. Season 2 or 3 waters it. Casey walking out tells the audience everything: he saw where this leads.

**TIME IN EPISODE:** 60-90 seconds. Quick. The walkout is the beat.

### ERA 3: IBM (1957, Poughkeepsie, New York)

Casey in a white shirt and tie, at a drafting table. Punch cards everywhere. The IBM 704 humming in an adjacent room. This is the mainframe era — computing born from the census bureau and the defense department.

Casey respects this work. The craft IS real. The precision of wiring boards, the elegance of instruction sets, the satisfaction of a clean compile. He's been here six years. He's good at this. He has colleagues he respects. (This is the era referenced in 1x03's flashback — the null-termination argument.)

**KEY SCENE:** Casey is teaching a junior engineer how to read a core memory dump. The printout is three feet long. Casey traces a line with his pencil, reads the hex, translates in his head.

**CASEY:** "See this? This is Mrs. Patterson's social security number. And this —" *(he moves down the page)* "— is her sister's. They're in adjacent records because the census bureau filed alphabetically by county, and the Pattersons live in the same county."

**JUNIOR ENGINEER:** "You can read the data? The actual people?"

**CASEY:** "Someone has to remember there are people in the machine."

The junior engineer nods. Casey goes back to the printout. He's content here. The craft is honest. The machines do what you tell them. The people who build them care about getting it right.

But: the camera pulls back. Through the window: a military officer in the corridor. The machines were built for the census, then requisitioned for H-bomb calculations, now being sold to corporations. The same hardware, different masters. Casey sees the trajectory — the tool doesn't determine its use. But the institution that *funds* the tool does.

**THE NOMINALISM:** The military-industrial complex doesn't care about Mrs. Patterson's social security number. It cares about throughput. The computer was born as a census machine (knowing particulars) and became a defense machine (processing abstractions). The craft is real. The context is corrupted. Casey respects the one and distrusts the other. He stays for the craft. He leaves — eventually — because the context wins.

**CASEY'S LINE (present-day):** "The machines were honest. The people who paid for the machines were not. But I stayed because the *work* was real. You can endure a bad employer if the craft is good."

**TIME IN EPISODE:** 90-120 seconds. This is the warmest flashback — Casey at his happiest. The audience should feel his loss when he eventually leaves.

### ERA 4: The Web3 Startup (2019, San Francisco)

Casey in a WeWork. Open floor plan. Standing desks. A whiteboard covered in illegible diagrams. Young people in branded hoodies. Casey looks exactly the same as he did in 1858 — the joke the show has been telling since episode 1.

A founder is pitching to investors. Casey is in the back, arms crossed.

**FOUNDER:** "We're building a decentralized governance protocol for —" *(checks notes)* "— actually, governance is just one vertical. The platform is agnostic. It can tokenize any —" *(waves hand)* "— any *thing*."

**INVESTOR:** "What thing?"

**FOUNDER:** "That's the beauty. It doesn't matter. The token is the abstraction layer. The underlying asset is irrelevant."

Casey's jaw sets. Not anger — something older. Recognition.

**KEY SCENE:** After the pitch. Casey and the founder alone.

**CASEY:** "What does it *do*?"

**FOUNDER:** "It provides a substrate for —"

**CASEY:** "What does it *do*. For a person. A specific person."

**FOUNDER:** *(genuinely confused)* "It's a platform. It doesn't do something *for* someone. It enables —"

**CASEY:** "What?"

**FOUNDER:** *(long pause)* "...Anything?"

**CASEY:** *(standing)* "I've been building things for a long time. Every time someone says 'it can be anything,' it turns out to be nothing."

He walks out. (The same walk. The same door-closing beat as the Taylor lecture. The rhyme is deliberate.)

**POST-WALKOUT:** Casey at a desk. Late at night. The WeWork is empty. He's packing a box. Not much in it — a few tools, a notebook, a pen. He pauses. Looks at the whiteboard one last time. One phrase visible: **"Decentralized Everything."**

He erases the whiteboard. The whole thing. Clean. Walks out.

This is the breaking point. After this, Casey goes solo. Thirty years alone. Building clean systems by himself. No dependencies — neither software nor human.

**THE NOMINALISM:** Peak nominalism. Nothing has a nature. Everything is a platform. The token is the abstraction. The underlying asset is irrelevant. The very concept of "doing something for someone specific" is incomprehensible — the platform exists for the platform's sake. *This is where the cobbler's wound becomes fatal.* The cobbler knew feet. The factory forgot feet. Taylor measured feet. IBM processed feet as numbers. Web3 declared feet irrelevant.

**CASEY'S LINE (present-day):** "I watched them tokenize nothing and call it innovation. That's when I knew it was over."

**TIME IN EPISODE:** 90-120 seconds. The WeWork scene should be quietly devastating. Not angry. Empty.

### FLASHBACK STRUCTURE IN EPISODE

The flashbacks should be **intercut with the present-day A-plot**, not grouped. Suggested placement:

1. **Factory/First Death** — Cold Open or early Act 1. Casey arrives at the Tempus problem and remembers the first time something he valued was replaced by something generic.
2. **Taylor Lecture** — Act 2, when the team discusses synchronization/measurement. Measuring time rhymes with measuring people.
3. **IBM** — Act 3, when Casey and Carter are deep in the design work. Casey's happiest era intercut with his current happiness — working with a partner for the first time in decades.
4. **Web3** — Late Act 3 or early Act 4. Just before Casey's turning point in present-day. The breaking point that CAUSED his isolation, immediately before the moment that begins to HEAL it.

**INTERCUT TECHNIQUE:** Each flashback should begin with a visual rhyme — Casey's hands doing something in present-day that cuts to his hands in the past. The cobbler's hands on leather → the engineer's hands on a printout → the coder's hands on a keyboard → the erasing hand on the whiteboard. And then: Casey's hands on Nova Roma code, building Tempus. Full circle.

## 2. CASEY'S PRESENT-DAY ARC

### Where He Starts (entering 1x08)

Casey has been on this team for seven episodes. He's been useful — his C89 expertise, his clean code philosophy, his longevity. But he's been operating in the mode he knows: build it right, build it alone, check it in. He's been *beside* the team, not *in* it.

After 1x07:
- O'Neill noticed Casey's prayer ("Huh"). Casey doesn't know this.
- Casey said grace at Pliny's villa. The faith thread is visible, not yet challenged.
- Joe Dawson has arrived — another adult in the room, another person who has spent decades watching instead of participating.

### The Episode Arc

**Beat 1: Casey Takes the Problem.**
Carter needs timestamps. Every file they saved in 1x07 has no temporal context. The census, the encyclopedia, the vocabulary — all frozen. "When was this saved? An hour ago? A week ago? We don't know." Casey knows time systems. He built them at IBM. He built them alone for thirty years. He volunteers.

**Beat 2: Casey Works Alone (Initial Instinct).**
Casey goes to his workstation. He starts designing Tempus by himself. This is his default. Thirty years of muscle memory. He's sketching the architecture — high-precision clocks, frame timing, easing functions — when Carter comes to check on him.

**CARTER:** "How's it going?"

**CASEY:** "I'll have something by tonight."

**CARTER:** "Can I see what you're thinking?"

Casey hesitates. Not hostility — just unfamiliarity. He's not used to showing work in progress. He turns the screen toward her.

**Beat 3: Carter Sees the Design — And Improves It.**
Carter looks at Casey's Tempus design. It's good. It's clean. It's exactly what a brilliant engineer working alone for thirty years would produce. But it's missing something.

**CARTER:** "You've got the clock. You've got the frame timing. You've got the easing functions. But where's the synchronization? We have multiple machines now. If I save a file on one machine and read it on another, they need to agree on what time it is."

Casey stares at the screen. He hadn't thought about it. He's been building single-system tools for thirty years. The concept of *synchronized time across systems* — the very problem that makes distributed computing hard — hasn't been in his design vocabulary because he hasn't HAD a distributed system. He's had himself.

**CARTER:** "We need a reference clock. A source of truth. Then every machine syncs to it."

**CASEY:** *(slowly)* "An horologium. A public clock."

**CARTER:** "Exactly. Like the sundial in the Forum."

**Beat 4: The Turning Point — "Huh. That's better."**
This is the scene from the character arc document. It happens mid-episode, during the collaborative design session.

Carter proposes the `tempus_creare` function — independent clocks, allocated from the piscina, each with their own epoch. Casey had been designing with a single global clock. Carter's version allows multiple independent timekeepers — one per machine, one per process, one per test.

Casey's first instinct — physical, visible, the actor should show it — is to reject. His jaw tightens. His hand moves toward the keyboard, ready to explain why the global clock is sufficient.

Then he stops. He reads Carter's design again. The independent clocks still reference a shared frequency. They're independent but *calibrated*. Each clock knows its own epoch but speaks the same language. It's not chaos — it's federation.

**CASEY:** *(beat)* "Huh. That's better."

Four words. The turning point of his season arc. The hermit acknowledges that another person's design improves on his own. Not in theory — in the actual code. Her version is objectively better.

**CARTER:** *(carefully, because she knows what this means for him)* "It's both of ours. Your clock, my synchronization."

**CASEY:** "Yeah." *(beat)* "Yeah, that's how it should work."

**Dramatic weight:** Casey has been alone for thirty years because he decided collaboration was impossible in a world where nothing meant anything. Carter just showed him that collaboration works when both people care about the craft. The Web3 founder couldn't answer "What does it do for a person?" Carter can. She can answer it precisely, technically, and she's sitting right here proving it.

**Beat 5: Casey Teaches.**
Later in the episode, Marcus asks Casey to explain the easing functions. This is the first time Casey teaches anyone anything on Nova Roma.

He's terrible at it. He assumes too much knowledge. He skips steps. Marcus looks lost.

Casey stops. Takes a breath. Starts over. Slower. Picks up Marcus's stylus.

**CASEY:** "When you lay a brick, you don't slam it down. You ease it into place. Fast at the start, slow at the end. The mortar needs time to accept the weight."

**MARCUS:** *(understanding lighting up)* "Lenire — to soften. The easing is the softening."

**CASEY:** "That's it. That's exactly it."

He's terrible at teaching but getting better in real time. This seeds 1x15-16 where he teaches his first class.

**Beat 6: The Evening — Joe and Casey.**
Quiet scene. Joe's bar isn't open yet but he's claimed a corner of a Roman tavern. Casey comes in. They've met but haven't really talked.

**JOE:** "Duncan says you've been alone for thirty years."

**CASEY:** "Duncan talks too much."

**JOE:** "I've spent thirty years watching someone else live. You've spent thirty years building alone. We're both experts in solitude."

**CASEY:** *(sits down, takes the offered wine)* "What made you stop watching?"

**JOE:** *(long beat)* "I came here."

**CASEY:** "Yeah." *(looking at the wine, the tavern, the Romans going about their evening)* "Me too."

This is the mirror scene. Two men who chose isolation — Joe as Watcher, Casey as hermit — both arriving at the same place from opposite directions. Joe watched but didn't build. Casey built but didn't watch. On Nova Roma, they're both learning the other thing.

---

## 3. CASEY/CARTER COLLABORATION BEATS

The Casey/Carter partnership is THE central technical relationship of the show. 1x08 is where it becomes real. Previous episodes had them working in proximity. This episode has them working *together*.

### Beat A: The Design Session (Act 2)
Side by side at a workstation. Carter draws diagrams. Casey codes. They interrupt each other — not rudely, but with the rhythm of two people who think at the same speed.

**CARTER:** "The horologium needs sub-second precision."

**CASEY:** "Pulsus — beats. The hardware has a crystal oscillator. Millions of beats per second."

**CARTER:** "So we count beats and divide by frequency to get seconds."

**CASEY:** "That's already in there." *(shows her the `tempus_nunc` function)*

**CARTER:** *(reading the code)* "Clean. But what about drift?"

**CASEY:** "Drift?"

**CARTER:** "Over long periods, the oscillator drifts. A clock that's accurate to the microsecond still drifts over hours. Days. Months."

**CASEY:** *(the man who has lived 200 years, hearing about temporal drift for the first time in a way that matters)* "...How much drift?"

**CARTER:** "Enough to matter for timestamps on files that need to be comparable across years."

This is the moment Casey understands why he needs a partner. He's been building for the short term — frame timing for games, animation for UIs. Carter thinks in *years*. She's absorbed Marcus's Roman thinking. Casey has the craft; Carter has the scale.

### Beat B: The Code Moment (Act 3)
The audience sees Casey and Carter writing code together. Real collaboration — she starts a function, he finishes it. He starts a struct, she adds a field.

```c
/* Casey scribens */
structura Horologium {
    i64 pulsus_initii;
    f64 frequentia;
    /* Carter addens: */
    f64 correctio_derivationis;
    i64 pulsus_referentiae;
};
```

The on-screen code is literally both of theirs. The audience watches the struct grow. Two sets of hands on two keyboards. The first truly collaborative build on the show.

### Beat C: The Sync Test (Act 4-5)
Carter and Casey run the synchronization test — two independent clocks, started at different times, both querying `tempus_nunc`. The results should be identical. They're not. Off by eleven microseconds.

**CASEY:** "Eleven microseconds. On a WARPED temporal field."

**CARTER:** "That's close enough for timestamps."

**CASEY:** "That's not close enough for anything. Eleven microseconds means the clocks are *lying*."

**CARTER:** *(smiling)* "You sound like Teal'c."

**CASEY:** *(not smiling back — this matters to him)* "Eleven microseconds means we're measuring time wrong. And if we're measuring time wrong in a place where time is already wrong — we'll never find the signal in Carter's data."

He's talking about the compass data. Carter saved her temporal readings in 1x07. She needs precise time to analyze the periodic frequency she discovered. Casey doesn't know about the temporal anomaly — but he knows that wrong clocks make every timestamp a lie. His craftsman's obsession with precision serves Carter's secret investigation without either of them knowing it.

---

## 5. CASEY'S FAITH THREAD (After O'Neill's "Huh")

### Status Entering 1x08
The faith thread after 1x07: O'Neill has noticed. Casey said grace at Pliny's villa. The observer circle now includes the team commander. The season outline says 1x07-08 is: "Casey says grace quietly before a meal at Pliny's villa. O'Neill notices."

Since 1x07 handled the Pliny's villa grace and O'Neill's "Huh," 1x08 should advance the thread slightly.

### 1x08 Faith Beat: The Rosary and the Roman

From the season outline: "1x03-04: Casey's rosary visible when he reaches into a pocket. A Roman notices but says nothing." This was planted in 1x03 (Beat 11 — a Roman engineer notices the beads). In 1x08, we pay this thread forward.

**SCENE:** Casey and Marcus are working on easing functions. Casey reaches for his stylus and the rosary shifts in his pocket — not falling out, just visible for a moment. This time it's Marcus who sees it.

**MARCUS:** *(not now — later, in a quiet moment)* "Your counting beads. You still carry them."

**CASEY:** "Always."

**MARCUS:** "The other Romans have noticed. They say you count prayers. Like a priest."

**CASEY:** "Not like a priest. Like a man who needs to remember."

**MARCUS:** *(considering this)* "Remember what?"

**CASEY:** *(beat)* "That I'm not in charge."

Marcus doesn't understand this fully. But he files it — the engineer who builds with terrifying precision, who counts to sub-microsecond accuracy, reminding himself he's not in charge. To a Roman, this reads as *pietas* — proper relationship to something greater. Marcus respects it without understanding it.

**DRAMATIC FUNCTION:** This is the first time Casey's faith intersects with his *work* on screen. The rosary has been a visual — in his pocket, visible but uncommented. Here, the man who builds clocks carries prayer beads. The man who measures time in pulsus also counts in decades of the rosary. Two systems of counting, both essential to him.

**Nightcrawler approach:** No theology. No explanation. Just a craftsman who carries two instruments — one for measuring time, one for remembering what time is for.

### 1x08 Faith Beat (Visual Only): The Workshop Cross

Casey's workstation has a small crucifix. Not new — it was there in 1x02 (Casey's workbench). But in 1x08, when Carter sits down beside him for the first time in the collaborative design session, the camera frames them both with the crucifix between their workstations. Background. Compositional. The audience who has been tracking it sees it. Nobody comments.

---

## 6. THREE-VOICE ALGORITHM MOMENT CANDIDATES

### Option A: Casey / Carter / Marcus — "What Is Time For?"

Three engineers, three perspectives on what time measurement means:

**CASEY:** "Time is precision. If you can't measure it exactly, you can't build on it. A clock that lies by eleven microseconds will corrupt every timestamp in the system. Time is the foundation you build everything on."

**CARTER:** "Time is context. A file without a timestamp is evidence without a witness. Time tells you when something happened, which tells you *why* it happened, which tells you what to do next. Time is how you read the story of the system."

**MARCUS:** "Time is a sundial in the Forum. The sundial tells the same truth to everyone who reads it. The patrician and the slave both know when the market opens. Time is the thing that belongs to no one because it belongs to everyone. *(beat)* The horologium is a public good."

**Structure:** Craft → Science → Civics. Casey measures. Carter interprets. Marcus democratizes.

### Option B: Casey / Methos / Pliny — "Two Hundred Years, Five Thousand Years, Eighty Years"

Three men with very different relationships to the passage of time:

**CASEY:** "Two hundred years. I watched the cobbler die. I watched the factory rise. I watched computing begin and watched it lose its way. *(beat)* Time doesn't heal. It accumulates."

**METHOS:** "Five thousand years. I watched civilizations measure time by the stars, then by pendulums, then by crystals. The measurements got smaller. The ambitions got shorter. *(beat)* Your ancestors thought in dynasties. Your generation thinks in quarterly reports."

**PLINY:** "Eighty years. One lifetime. *(beat)* You have centuries. You have millennia. I have what I have. And I would not trade my eighty years for your thousands, because every year I lived, I knew was mine."

**Structure:** Centuries → Millennia → A single lifetime. The Immortals have *too much* time. Pliny has *exactly enough*. The mortal voice is the most powerful because he's the one for whom time is actually scarce.

### RECOMMENDATION: Option A for the main algorithm moment (it maps directly to the A-plot library concepts — precision, context, public good). Option B as a separate evening scene (Act 4 or Tag) — it's too good to waste and serves the character arcs differently. Option B is the *emotional* moment. Option A is the *technical* moment.

---

## 7. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR COMPILATION PHASE

1. **Casey's first death — location and era.** I've placed it in 1858 Manchester. The season outline says "1850s-60s." Is Manchester right, or should it be an American setting? Manchester anchors the Industrial Revolution directly but makes Casey British-origin. An American factory town (Lowell, Massachusetts?) keeps him American.

2. **The "Huh, that's better" moment — which specific design improvement triggers it?** I've proposed Carter's independent-clocks-with-shared-frequency design. Is this the right technical beat, or should it be something simpler/more visually legible?

3. **Joe/Casey mirror scene — timing in episode.** I've placed it in the evening (end of Act 4 or early Act 5). Could be earlier if the episode needs character breathing room in Act 2-3.

4. **Teal'c's timing discrepancy near Midas — how explicit?** I've proposed that Teal'c discovers the global clock and independent clocks report different elapsed times near Midas, but doesn't report it to Carter. Is this too much C-plot overlap with what Carter is doing privately? Or is it the right amount of converging-investigations?

5. **Casey teaching Marcus easing functions — how much screen time?** Could be 30 seconds (quick beat, Casey struggling, Marcus getting it) or 90 seconds (a real teaching scene with comedy). The longer version sets up Casey's teaching arc for 1x15-16 more strongly.

6. **Three-voice: Option A, Option B, or both?** If both, the episode may run long. If one, which carries more weight?

7. **The IBM flashback and the 1x03 flashback — continuity.** In 1x03 (Beat 11), we see Casey at IBM in 1952 arguing about null termination. In 1x08, we see him at IBM again (1957) — happy, reading core dumps, knowing Mrs. Patterson's social security number. These should feel like the same era, same building, same life. Should 1x08's IBM flashback explicitly reference the null-termination argument ("Five years ago I lost that argument. The industry went with scanning. But the work — the work is still real.")?

8. **Flashback visual motif — hands.** Is the hand-rhyme (cobbler's hands on leather / engineer's hands on printout / coder's hands on keyboard / erasing hand on whiteboard / Casey's hands on Tempus code) too heavy-handed? Or exactly right for a 42-minute episode?

---

## ADDITIONAL CHARACTER NOTES

### Casey's Physical Vocabulary

Casey moves differently in each era:
- **1858:** Precise, physical, grounded. A craftsman's economy of motion.
- **1911:** Restrained. Still. Walks out with controlled anger.
- **1957:** Relaxed. Comfortable. The way you move when you belong somewhere.
- **2019:** Tight. Contained. A man in a space that doesn't fit him.
- **Nova Roma (present):** Somewhere between IBM-comfortable and solo-tight. Opening up in real time. By end of episode, his posture during the Casey/Carter collaboration mirrors his IBM-era ease.

### Casey and the Word "Horologium"

When the library gets named, Casey has a moment:

**CASEY:** "Horologium. A public clock."

**MARCUS:** "The horologium in the Forum. Built by Manius Valerius. It was wrong for a hundred years — brought from Catania, wrong latitude. But the Romans kept it because a wrong public clock is better than no public clock."

**CASEY:** *(laughing)* "A hundred years of wrong time?"

**MARCUS:** "A hundred years of *shared* wrong time. They all agreed on what time it was. The agreement was more important than the accuracy."

This is a philosophical bomb. Casey the craftsman cares about accuracy. Marcus the Roman cares about consensus. The Tempus library needs to be BOTH — accurate AND agreed-upon. The tension between Casey's precision and Marcus's civic instinct is productive, not destructive.

### The Episode's Emotional Spine

Casey's journey in 1x08: **From "I build alone" to "I build with."**

The flashback shows WHY he was alone — each era stripped away a reason to collaborate. The cobbler was replaced. The Taylor worker was optimized. The IBM engineer was co-opted. The Web3 founder couldn't even define what he was building.

The present-day shows WHY he's not alone anymore — Carter can answer "What does it do for a person?" Marcus understands the civic purpose of a clock. The work is real again. The people care again. For the first time in thirty years, Casey has collaborators who deserve the word.

**FINAL IMAGE suggestion:** Casey at his workstation, late at night. Carter's additions to the Tempus code visible on screen. The crucifix on the wall behind him. The rosary in his pocket. He reads Carter's code one more time. Doesn't change it. Closes the laptop. Walks out into the Nova Roma night.

A man who built alone for thirty years, leaving someone else's code untouched. Because it's good. Because it's better than what he would have written alone. Because that's what a team is.

*End of Character / Flashback Pitch*
