# NOVUM FUNDAMENTUM
## Episode 1x05: "Tabularium Novum" (The New Archive)
### Character & Flashback Pitch (Writers' Room Draft)

---

## THE SHAPE OF THE EPISODE

This is Pliny's episode. He's been the background patriarch since 1x01 — the eighty-year-old polymath sitting in his chair, eyes missing nothing, forty volumes of handwritten records representing six decades of devotion to Nova Roma. In 1x04, Marcus built something that automated the census Pliny had kept by hand for eighty years, and Pliny accepted it with grace: "This is better." But *better* has a cost. The census was a practical tool. The *Naturalis Historia Nova* — Pliny's encyclopedia, his life's work, his forty handwritten volumes cataloguing every plant, mineral, trade, custom, and phenomenon on this world — that's something else entirely. That's his soul on parchment.

And now it needs to be searchable.

The A-plot is the hash table: *Tabula Dispersa*, the scattered table, with *friatio* (hashing) as its core mechanism. The fingerprint of knowledge — reduce anything to a number, use that number to find it instantly. Pliny's encyclopedia, which currently requires knowing which of forty volumes to open, becomes accessible to anyone with a question.

But the character pitch isn't about what the hash table does. It's about what it means to an old man who has spent his entire life being the index.

## PLINY'S ARC: THE INDEX BECOMES A BOOK

### Where Pliny Has Been

In 1x01, Pliny was the living record — the man who met the strangers, classified them, assessed them. He sat in his chair at the census and nothing escaped his notice. He was the colony's memory, its institutional knowledge, its cross-reference.

In 1x03, Pliny watched Lucia and Daniel argue about strings and saw his own future: structured data would eventually come for his unstructured notes. He said nothing. He is a patient man.

In 1x04, the census — Pliny's most visible daily function — was automated. Marcus built the Xar. Pliny ceded it with dignity: "A census that depends on one old man's hand is a census that dies when the old man does." He meant it. But meaning it and feeling it are different things for anyone. Even for Pliny.

In 1x05, the crisis is not that Pliny resists the hash table. The crisis is that he *welcomes* it — and in welcoming it, confronts something he has been avoiding for eighty years: if all his knowledge can be indexed by a machine, what was the point of *him*?

### The Want

Pliny wants his encyclopedia to be useful after he dies. He is eighty years old on a world where he has no successor — no one with his breadth of knowledge, his decades of observation, his habit of recording everything. The *Naturalis Historia Nova* is forty volumes that only Pliny can navigate efficiently. Ask him where to find the entry on the mineral deposits in the eastern hills and he'll tell you: Volume 12, approximately two-thirds through, after the section on clay soils and before the passage on river sediment. He is the index.

But he won't always be the index. And he knows it.

What Pliny wants is to make himself unnecessary — to build an index that works without him. What he *doesn't* expect is how it will feel when someone shows him that it's possible.

### The Learning

Pliny learns that *friatio* — hashing — doesn't destroy what it touches. It doesn't simplify his entries or reduce his observations. It creates a *fingerprint* — a way to find the thing without changing what the thing is. The encyclopedia is still forty volumes of Pliny's prose, his observations, his eighty years of paying attention. The hash table just tells you where to look.

This is the moderate realist position, though Pliny wouldn't use those words: the hash respects the nature of what it indexes. The entry on volcanic glass is still Pliny's entry on volcanic glass — the hash table has no opinion about it. It just knows where it lives.

The cost: Pliny has to *give* his entries titles. His encyclopedia is written in flowing, associative prose — one observation leading to the next, organized by the logic of a mind that has been thinking about Nova Roma for sixty years. It is not organized for strangers. It is organized for Pliny. To make it searchable, each entry needs a *clavis* — a key, a name, a fixed identifier. Pliny must break his flowing river of thought into discrete, nameable units. This is not trivial. This is a man editing his own mind.

### The Cost

The cost isn't emotional devastation. Pliny is too wise for that. The cost is something subtler: the recognition that his particular form of knowledge — associative, interconnected, flowing from one thought to the next the way a naturalist observes the world — is not how knowledge will be stored going forward. The hash table needs discrete keys. The future needs categories. His river must become a series of named pools.

He does it. He does it willingly. He does it with the same grace he showed in 1x04. But Casey catches a moment — late at night, Pliny alone in his study, running his hand along the spine of Volume 1. Just touching it. Not reading it. Remembering writing it. Casey doesn't say anything. He's seen the expression before — the expression of a man holding something he built, knowing it will survive him in a form he didn't quite imagine.

## THE PLINY FLASHBACK

### Why Pliny Gets the Flashback

The flashback pattern so far: Casey at IBM in 1952 (1x03), Duncan at Cologne Cathedral in the 1630s (1x04). Both Immortals. Both looking backward across centuries. The flashback this episode breaks the pattern — because Pliny is mortal. His flashback isn't centuries. It's decades. And that makes it more devastating, not less.

### The Eruption (~79 AD, Bay of Naples)

Pliny the Elder was fifty-six years old when Vesuvius erupted. In our history, he died — sailing toward the eruption to rescue friends, overcome by volcanic gases at Stabiae. A naturalist killed by his own curiosity. The uncle who sailed toward the fire while everyone else sailed away.

In our show, Pliny survived. Barely. The temporal anomaly that created Nova Roma pulled him through before the ash could finish what the gases started. He arrived on Nova Roma already old, already dying, and was given — not immortality, but *time*. Eighty more years. The rest of the colony has been here for about sixty years (the gate opened roughly twenty years before the colony's natural birth rate produced the current generation). Pliny has been here since before the colony had a name.

### The Flashback Structure

**INTERCUT — FLASHBACK:**

**Location:** Misenum, Bay of Naples. August 24, 79 AD. Afternoon.

Pliny is writing. He's always writing. The room is cluttered — scrolls, wax tablets, pressed botanical specimens, a half-eaten meal he forgot about. His nephew (Pliny the Younger — a boy of seventeen) reads beside him.

Through the window: Vesuvius. A cloud is rising from its peak. Not smoke. Something larger. Something that looks like a pine tree, the trunk rising and the branches spreading.

**PLINY (V.O., present day, slow and precise):** I was writing about the cultivation of olive trees when the mountain opened. I did not stop writing immediately. The cloud was... interesting. I had never seen one shaped like that. I recorded its dimensions, its color, its rate of expansion. *(beat)* A naturalist's instinct. Observe first. Feel later.

The flashback INTERCUTS with present-day Pliny working on the hash table keys — writing the *clavis* for each entry, naming each piece of his encyclopedia. The parallel is structural: in 79 AD, Pliny was indexing the natural world as it was being destroyed. In the present, he's indexing his own life's work so that it survives him.

**Flashback continues:** Pliny receives a message from Rectina at Stabiae. The shore is burning. People need rescue. Pliny orders the fleet. His nephew asks to come. Pliny tells him to stay and keep writing.

**PLINY:** *(to the nephew, urgent but controlled)* Stay here. Write down everything you see. If I don't come back, the record matters more than the recorder.

**PLINY (V.O., present day):** The record matters more than the recorder. I believed that at fifty-six. I believe it at eighty. But at eighty, I understand what it costs the recorder to believe it.

**The key moment:** Pliny on the ship, sailing TOWARD the eruption. Ash falling. Pumice striking the deck. Sailors terrified. And Pliny — dictating. To a scribe who is shaking so badly the wax tablet jumps. Pliny dictating observations about the eruption, the column height, the wind direction, the composition of the falling debris. Not because he doesn't feel the fear. Because observation is what he does with fear. He turns terror into data. It is his nature. It has always been his nature.

**The cut:** The ship reaches Stabiae. Pliny helps people onto the boats. The air is thick. He can't breathe. He falls. The volcanic gas — sulfur, carbon dioxide — is heavier than air. It pools on the ground. Pliny is on the ground.

**And then the light changes.** Not the light of eruption. Something else — a shimmer, a distortion. The temporal effect. Nova Roma pulling him through. He doesn't understand it. He doesn't need to. He's on his back, choking, and then he's somewhere else, choking differently, and the sky is full of unfamiliar stars.

**PLINY (V.O., present day):** I woke in a field I didn't recognize under stars I couldn't name. I spent the first three months naming them. *(beat)* I never stopped writing. The world changed. The habit didn't.

**SMASH CUT TO:** Present day. Pliny writing a *clavis* — a hash key — for his entry on the stars of Nova Roma. The same stars he named when he arrived. His first act on a new world: observation. His last great act on that world: indexing.

### The Visual Rhymes

1. **Pliny dictating to the terrified scribe** (79 AD) rhymes with **Pliny dictating hash keys to Carter** (present day). Both times, Pliny is calmly organizing knowledge while someone else operates the machinery.

2. **Ash falling on the ship's deck** rhymes with **ink drying on parchment** in Pliny's study. Both are the residue of something transformative.

3. **The nephew told to stay and keep writing** rhymes with **Marcus inheriting the census** — Pliny's pattern of making others the record-keeper.

4. **Pliny falling, unable to breathe** rhymes with **Pliny's quiet moment with Volume 1** — the same man, horizontal then and vertical now, confronting the same truth: the work survives the worker.

5. **The temporal shimmer that saves him** rhymes with **the hash function** — something that transforms what it touches without destroying it.

## THE CASEY/PLINY FAITH BEAT

### The Setup

This is not an argument about religion. It is two old men sitting in a library at the end of a long day.

Pliny has been writing hash keys for hours. He is tired — not the dramatic tiredness of Act Three climaxes but the grinding tiredness of an eighty-year-old man who has been doing intellectual labor since dawn. His hand hurts. His eyes ache. Forty volumes, each needing hundreds of keys. He's on Volume 7. The work stretches ahead of him like the volcanic ash column — vast, unfinishable by one man.

Casey brings him wine. Not because anyone asked. Because Casey is the kind of man who notices when someone else has been working too long and brings them something. He sits down across from Pliny. They don't speak for a moment. Two men comfortable enough with each other for silence.

Then:

### The Scene

**PLINY:** *(setting down his stylus, flexing his hand)* Twenty-three years. I have been organizing this encyclopedia for twenty-three years. I know every entry. I know where every observation is. I know which pages the ink smudged and which pages the margins are too narrow. *(beat)* I am inside this work, Casey. My mind IS the index. And now I am writing the index outside my mind so that someone else's mind can find what mine found.

**CASEY:** *(quiet)* That's a gift.

**PLINY:** It does not feel like a gift. It feels like... *(searching)* ...an evacuation.

Long pause. Casey drinks his wine. Pliny stares at the stack of volumes.

**PLINY:** You have lived longer than I have. Two hundred years. How do you carry that much remembering?

**CASEY:** Badly, sometimes.

**PLINY:** *(pressing)* But what do you do with it? The weight of it? I have eighty years of observations and the weight is considerable. You have twice that and more. What do you do when the weight of memory becomes too heavy?

Casey looks at him. This is the question the outline planted. Casey answers simply, without performance:

**CASEY:** I pray.

**PLINY:** *(interested, not dismissive)* To whom?

**CASEY:** The God who remembers everything.

Beat. Pliny processes this. He has spent his entire life trying to record everything — every plant, mineral, custom, star, tidal pattern, insect behavior, soil composition. The idea of a being who actually DOES remember everything is not theological to him. It's practical. It's the endpoint of his own aspiration.

**PLINY:** That... would be a considerable memory.

**CASEY:** *(small smile)* Yeah.

**PLINY:** *(after a long pause, genuinely curious)* And this helps? Knowing that someone remembers, even if you forget?

**CASEY:** I'll put it this way. I've been alive for two hundred years. I've forgotten more than most people ever learn. Names. Faces. Whole decades, sometimes. And the thing that keeps me from losing my mind isn't that I wrote it all down. *(looking at Pliny's volumes)* It's knowing that even if I lose it, it's not lost.

**PLINY:** Because your god remembers.

**CASEY:** Because nothing that matters is ever really forgotten.

Pliny picks up his stylus again. He writes a hash key. Then he stops.

**PLINY:** *(to himself, almost)* The record matters more than the recorder. I have been telling myself that for thirty years. Your faith says the same thing — except that in your version, the recorder also matters.

**CASEY:** *(quietly)* That's a pretty good summary, actually.

**PLINY:** *(back to his keys, but lighter now)* I should add your religion to Volume 31. Comparative theology. *(beat)* It would require its own hash key. *(another beat)* Several, perhaps.

He's intrigued. Not converted. Intrigued. A polymath who has found a subject he hasn't exhausted. The scene ends with both men working — Pliny writing keys, Casey entering data — the silence comfortable again but different now. Warmer. Something has opened.

### Placement

This scene goes in late Act Two or early Act Three — after the hash table is working but before the encyclopedia is fully indexed. Pliny is in the middle of the labor, not at the beginning (too theoretical) or the end (too triumphant). The weariness is real. The conversation comes from exhaustion, not from dramatic necessity. That's what makes it land.

### What Follows

Pliny doesn't mention the conversation again in this episode. But in later episodes (1x07, the Casey grace-before-meals scene; 1x09, Pliny's first systematic questions about Catholicism), the audience will recognize this as the moment the door opened. Not a conversion. An aperture. The polymath adding one more subject to his infinite curiosity.

And it seeds Pliny's S3 deathbed scene — where Methos sits with him, and the last words are about organizing what we don't know. The audience who remembers this scene in 1x05 will understand: Pliny spent his last years not just indexing Nova Roma but grappling with the idea that there might be an Indexer.

## TEAL'C'S UNEXPECTED TEST FAILURE

### The Setup

Teal'c has been testing the hash table all episode. Methodically. Thoroughly. He's inserted thousands of entries — Pliny's encyclopedia data, census records, test strings, edge cases. Every test passes. `VERITAS` after `VERITAS`. The hash function distributes evenly. The collision resolution works. The table resizes correctly.

Then he runs a test nobody asked for.

### The Scene

**TEAL'C:** *(to the room, with the flat gravity of a man reporting an anomaly)* I have a test failure.

Everyone stops. The hash table has been working flawlessly.

**CARTER:** What test?

**TEAL'C:** I entered two different entries with the same key.

**MARCUS:** That should overwrite —

**TEAL'C:** It does. That is the failure.

Silence. Carter starts to speak — the hash table is DESIGNED to update when you insert with an existing key —

**TEAL'C:** Pliny has two entries for the volcanic glass formations in the eastern hills. One from thirty years ago. One from last year. The formations changed. The glass weathered differently than he predicted. Both entries are valuable. Both use the same key: "vitrum volcanicum orientale." *(beat)* When I insert the second, the first is destroyed.

Pliny, across the room, looks up.

**PLINY:** *(slow)* You are telling me that my system can only hold one truth per question?

**TEAL'C:** I am telling you that the current implementation assumes each key has one answer. If the world changes — if the volcanic glass weathers, if a river changes course, if a population shifts — the old answer is overwritten. *(beat)* The hash table forgets.

The room is quiet. This is the design limitation they didn't anticipate because it's not a limitation in most software contexts. A hash table maps keys to values. If you insert a new value for an existing key, the old value is replaced. That's correct behavior. That's what hash tables DO.

But Pliny's encyclopedia is a record of a WORLD — a world that changes over time. The volcanic glass entry from thirty years ago isn't wrong. It's the world as it was thirty years ago. The new entry is the world as it is now. Both are true. Both are valuable. The hash table can only hold one.

**CARTER:** We could append a date to the key —

**TEAL'C:** That changes the question. The question is not "what is the volcanic glass like at this date?" The question is "what is the volcanic glass like?" The answer has changed. The hash table must choose which answer to keep. *(beat)* That is a decision about truth. A data structure should not make decisions about truth.

**PLINY:** *(standing, which he rarely does)* He is correct.

**CARTER:** Pliny —

**PLINY:** If my encyclopedia can only hold the latest observation, it is not an encyclopedia. It is a newspaper.

This is Teal'c's role: finding the edge. Not the technical edge (collision handling, resize behavior) but the *philosophical* edge. The hash table works perfectly as a data structure. It fails as a *record of the world* because the world has history and the hash table, as currently designed, does not.

### The Resolution

The resolution is NOT to rebuild the hash table. The resolution is a design conversation:

**CARTER:** We have options. The value could be a list — every observation for that key, ordered by date.

**PLINY:** But then the key doesn't point to an answer. It points to a history of answers. The searcher must choose.

**CASEY:** *(quietly)* That might be the right design. You don't get to ask "what is the volcanic glass like?" and get a single answer. You get the history, and you decide.

**PLINY:** *(considering)* Like reading the primary sources instead of an abridgment.

**TEAL'C:** *(with what the audience might recognize as satisfaction)* Then the test should be: insert two values with the same key. Retrieve both. The hash table remembers.

Carter implements it — the value becomes a chain, a linked list of observations under each key, the most recent first, the oldest preserved. Nothing is overwritten. The hash table gains a memory.

**TEAL'C:** *(running the new test)* VERITAS.

He doesn't smile. But his nod has weight.

### What This Seeds

Teal'c's failure is the philosophical beat that elevates the hash table from a data structure to an *epistemological tool*. A hash table that overwrites is nominalist — the latest version is the only version, history is irrelevant. A hash table that preserves history is realist — the past remains real even when the present has changed.

Pliny's encyclopedia becomes the first historical database on Nova Roma — not just "what is true now" but "what was true, and when, and how it changed." This feeds directly into the Ratio truth-graph system in Season 3, where every claim has a dependency chain and every assumption is flagged.

## ENSEMBLE DYNAMICS

### Carter — The Facilitator

Carter's arc in this episode is one more step in the handoff sequence that began in 1x04. Last episode, she let Marcus lead the census design. In this episode, she facilitates *Pliny's* design. She doesn't propose the hash table — she implements what Pliny needs after he identifies the problem.

**CARTER:** *(early, to Casey)* In 1x04, Marcus told us what a census needed to be. Now Pliny is telling us what an encyclopedia needs to be. We're not designing anymore. We're translating.

**CASEY:** That was always the job.

Carter as translator, not architect. Her technical mastery is undiminished — she's the one who implements the hash function, the collision resolution, the resize logic. But the *requirements* come from the Romans now. The encylcopedia is Pliny's. The hash table serves his design. Carter's brilliance is in making Pliny's vision computable.

### Marcus — The Bridge, Quieter This Time

Marcus had his spotlight in 1x04. Here he's present but reduced — the senior engineer whose last project went well, now watching a colleague have their turn. His role is practical:

**MARCUS:** *(bringing Pliny's problem to the workshop)* Pliny says the census made him realize something. The census can grow. His encyclopedia cannot. He wants it searchable. He wants any citizen who has a question to find the answer without asking Pliny personally.

Marcus is the bridge between Pliny's need and Carter's capability. He's also the one who first identifies the name: *tabularium* — the Roman state archive, the building where official records were kept.

**MARCUS:** The Tabularium in Rome held the law, the treaties, the decrees. It was searchable because it was organized — by category, by date, by relevance. *(to Carter)* What you are building is a Tabularium Novum. A new archive. Not for laws. For everything Pliny knows.

### Daniel — The Namer

Daniel names the hash function. This continues his pattern from 1x03 (naming conventions for Chorda) and 1x04 (naming the Xar):

**DANIEL:** Hashing. We need a Latin term.

**LUCIA:** *(already writing)* Describe the process.

**DANIEL:** You take something complex — a string, a phrase, a full encyclopedia entry — and you reduce it to a number. A fingerprint. The fingerprint is unique enough to find the original, but it's not the original. It's... *(searching)*

**LUCIA:** A *friatio*. A crumbling. You take something whole and crumble it into a powder. The powder tells you what it was made of, but you cannot reconstitute the stone from the powder.

**DANIEL:** *(writing it down)* *Friatio.* That's... actually really good. Hashing as crumbling. Irreversible transformation.

**LUCIA:** *(dry)* You sound surprised. *(beat)* The table where the crumbled keys are stored — *tabula dispersa*. The scattered table. Because the entries are scattered by their fingerprints, not ordered by their nature.

Daniel and Lucia continue their intellectual tango — he proposes, she refines, they arrive somewhere neither started. In this episode, the space between them narrows slightly. Not a lot. An inch. Daniel hands her a stylus she dropped and their fingers almost touch. Almost. She notices. He doesn't. Or pretends not to.

### Data — The Precision

Data's role in this episode is specific: he identifies the mathematical properties of a good hash function. His contribution is a scene with Pliny where two very different minds converge on the same requirement.

**DATA:** A hash function must distribute evenly. If all entries hash to the same location, the table degrades to a list. The search becomes linear. The advantage is lost.

**PLINY:** *(following, slowly)* You are saying that a good fingerprint distinguishes. A bad fingerprint groups. If every stone crumbles to the same powder, the powder tells you nothing.

**DATA:** That is a precise analogy.

**PLINY:** *(pleased)* I have been making precise analogies for sixty years. It is what naturalists do.

**DATA:** I have been making precise observations for thirty-four years. I believe our disciplines are complementary.

**PLINY:** *(looking at Data with genuine warmth)* I believe they are.

This is the Pliny/Data connection — the naturalist and the android, both devoted to accurate observation, both compelled to record. Data is the person on Nova Roma most like Pliny in disposition, if not in form. This plants a seed for Methos inheriting Pliny's mantle in S3 — because Data could have been the heir, but Data is an observer, not an interpreter. Methos has both capacities.

### Duncan — Background, Watching

Duncan's presence in this episode is deliberate reduction after his spotlight in 1x04. He's in the background. He's watching. He's staying. That's the point — his arc in 1x04 was about *staying*, and this episode shows what staying looks like: not dramatic, not a decision every day. Just being present while others work.

One small moment:

**DUNCAN:** *(watching Pliny write hash keys late at night, to Casey)* How old is he?

**CASEY:** Eighty. Give or take.

**DUNCAN:** He's writing like a man who knows he's running out of pages.

**CASEY:** He's writing like a man who has more to say than pages allow.

**DUNCAN:** *(long pause)* I've had four hundred years and never written a book.

**CASEY:** You built other things.

**DUNCAN:** Did I?

He walks away. This is Duncan's new territory — not the restlessness of the swordsman, but the questioning of the man who stayed. What has he built in four hundred years? The cathedral was someone else's. The bridges were someone else's. The manuscripts were someone else's. Duncan protected builders. He never was one. On Nova Roma, surrounded by Pliny's forty volumes and Marcus's engineering and Carter's code, Duncan feels the absence of his own work. This will deepen through the season.

### O'Neill — The Question

O'Neill has a lighter presence in this episode, but one beat that matters:

**O'NEILL:** *(watching the hash table demonstration — Carter entering Pliny's entries, the table distributing them)* So you put something in, and the table decides where it goes?

**CARTER:** The hash function decides. Based on the key.

**O'NEILL:** And nobody chooses?

**CARTER:** The math chooses.

**O'NEILL:** *(skeptical)* Who chose the math?

Carter opens her mouth. Closes it. Because it's a real question. The hash function was designed — by Carter, by convention, by decades of computer science. The math doesn't "choose" neutrally. Someone chose the math. And whoever chooses the math chooses what gets found easily and what gets buried.

**O'NEILL:** I've run intelligence operations, Carter. The filing system is never neutral. Whoever designs the index controls the questions people can ask.

He walks out. Carter stares at the hash function. O'Neill, as usual, has asked the simple question that nobody technical thought to ask. This is the thread that connects to the Ratio truth-graph in S3 — the epistemological question of who designs the systems that determine what's findable.

### Methos — One Devastating Observation

Methos drifts through once. He's been reading Pliny's Volume 14 — the one on marine biology, which Pliny wrote during his first decade on Nova Roma when the coastal ecology was still unfamiliar.

He catches the tail end of the hash table discussion. Watches Carter demonstrate: insert a key, retrieve the value. Instant. Clean.

**METHOS:** How many entries can it hold?

**CARTER:** As many as we need. The table resizes.

**METHOS:** And if it holds everything Pliny has written? All forty volumes?

**CARTER:** Then you can find any entry by its key. Instantly.

**METHOS:** *(setting down his wine)* I have lived for five thousand years. I have been in three libraries that held everything their civilizations knew. Alexandria. The House of Wisdom. A library in a city whose name I've forgotten, which is rather the point. *(beat)* Each one was organized. Each one was searchable. Each one was the pride of its civilization. *(beat)* Each one burned.

Silence.

**METHOS:** The question is never "can you find what you're looking for?" The question is: when the fire comes — and the fire always comes — what survives? *(looking at Carter's laptop)* Your machine holds one copy. Pliny's parchment holds one copy. How many copies of this index will there be when the fire comes?

He picks up his wine and leaves. The room is quiet. Methos, the man who watched Alexandria burn, has just asked the backup question — not as a technical concern but as a five-thousand-year-old's survival instinct. The most organized library in the world is still one fire away from nothing.

This plants the seed for 1x15 (TCP/networking — replication) and 1x18 (TLS/Arcanum — encryption). The hash table must eventually be distributed. Methos knows this not because he understands computer science but because he has watched the world destroy what it organized, over and over, for fifty centuries.

### Midas — The Compass Spins

The C-plot: Carter notices Midas's temporal anomaly for the first time. They're in the same room as the hash table demonstration. Midas is standing near the laptop, watching. His compass — the small brass instrument he carries — starts spinning. Slowly at first. Then faster.

**MIDAS:** *(looking at the compass, annoyed)* It does this sometimes. Near your machines.

**CARTER:** *(alert)* Near the machines? Or near you?

**MIDAS:** *(shrugging)* Both. Neither. The needle has been restless since I arrived on this world. *(beat)* It has been restless for three thousand years.

Carter pulls out an instrument — a temporal variance detector she's been calibrating since they arrived. The readings spike when Midas is close. When he steps away, they drop. When he steps closer, they spike again.

**CARTER:** *(quietly, to O'Neill later)* It's him. The temporal variance. It's centered on Midas.

**O'NEILL:** Is that a problem?

**CARTER:** I don't know yet. But the gate's chronometric readings fluctuate when he's within fifty meters of it. *(beat)* He's a walking temporal anomaly, sir.

In the background, Methos sees the compass spinning. His expression shifts — barely visible. He's seen temporal artifacts before. He doesn't speak. But something old wakes up behind his eyes. This is the Cybele/Black Stone seed from the season outline: Methos recognizing something in Midas's anomaly that reminds him of something ancient, dangerous, and buried.

## THE EMOTIONAL THROUGHLINE

### What the Episode Is About

The episode is about **making knowledge findable versus just recording it**. Pliny has spent sixty years recording. The hash table transforms recording into retrieval. This sounds like progress. It is progress. But it is also a kind of loss — because when knowledge is indexed, the index becomes the authority, and the encyclopedist becomes the source material instead of the guide.

The emotional registers:

**Act One: Purpose.** Pliny identifies the problem himself. He is the one who says "my encyclopedia needs to be searchable." The energy is forward-moving. An old man who has decided, deliberately, to make his life's work accessible to people who will never know him. This is generosity on a scale that most people never attempt.

**Act Two: Weight.** The labor of writing hash keys — the *claves* — is grueling. Pliny's encyclopedia wasn't written for indexing. Breaking his flowing prose into discrete, keyable entries forces him to confront how personal his organization is. The flashback to Vesuvius INTERCUTS here: Pliny dictating observations as ash falls, the same compulsion to record, the same inability to stop organizing even while the world is burning. The Casey/Pliny faith conversation lands in this act — two men too tired for pretense, talking about what you do with the weight of memory.

**Act Three: Light.** The hash table works. The encyclopedia is searchable. A Roman citizen — a young woman, a farmer's daughter, someone who has never opened Pliny's volumes — types a key: "cerasi silvestres" (wild cherry trees). The hash function runs. The entry appears: Pliny's observation from forty years ago, when he found the cherry groves in the northern valley, his prose detailed and alive. She reads it. She has the information she needed. She has never met Pliny.

Pliny watches from across the room. The moment is small but complete: his knowledge, surviving contact with a stranger's question. The encyclopedia works without him. He set out to make himself unnecessary, and he has, and it is both the proudest moment of his life and the moment he begins to be finished.

**Tag:** Pliny, alone, adding one more entry to Volume 40 — the volume he hasn't finished, the one still being written. The entry is about the hash table itself. About *friatio*. He's recording the tool that will make his recording searchable. The naturalist, observing the observation system. Still writing. Always writing. Until he can't.

## CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS THAT SHIFT

1. **Pliny and Casey**: Before this episode, they were collegial — the old polymath and the old cowboy, respecting each other across a distance. After the faith conversation, they're friends. Not dramatic friends. Quiet friends. The kind who sit in a room together without speaking and both feel better for it. This friendship is what makes Casey suggest a funeral Mass in S3.

2. **Pliny and Data**: The complementary disciplines scene opens a channel between them. Data begins visiting Pliny's study — not to help, but to observe Pliny observing. The naturalist and the android, both watchers. This makes Pliny's death hit Data differently in S3 — the loss of the one person on Nova Roma who shared his disposition toward the world.

3. **Carter and O'Neill**: O'Neill's "who chose the math?" question creates a new kind of tension. Carter designs systems she believes are neutral. O'Neill knows from intelligence work that nothing designed is neutral. This is a productive disagreement that runs through the series — Carter's engineer's faith in elegant systems, O'Neill's operator's knowledge that systems serve whoever built them.

4. **Duncan and himself**: Duncan's brief scene with Casey about never having written a book shifts his internal landscape. He begins, not this episode but soon, to consider what his contribution to Nova Roma might be that isn't protection. The swordsman asking what he builds.

5. **Teal'c and Pliny**: Teal'c's test failure is about Pliny's encyclopedia specifically — it's Pliny's entries that have two versions. Teal'c, the tester, has understood Pliny's work deeply enough to find the philosophical edge case. Pliny, who stood when Teal'c made his point, now sees Teal'c differently — not just as the disciplined test-writer but as someone who understood what the encyclopedia *means*. A freed slave insisting that history not be overwritten. A man who was counted as inventory ensuring that the count preserves what it counts.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

### The Cross-Franchise Algorithm Moment

Three franchise representatives describing the same hashing concept through different metaphors:

**PLINY:** It is like a naturalist's taxonomy — you reduce the animal to its genus, its species, its distinguishing features. The classification tells you where to find it in the record.

**DATA:** It is a deterministic mapping from an arbitrary-length input to a fixed-length output. Formally, a surjective function from the set of all possible keys to the set of bucket indices.

**CASEY:** It's like branding cattle. You look at the brand, you know which ranch. You don't have to chase the cow around the pasture.

Same algorithm. Three translations. All correct. Pliny by observation, Data by formalism, Casey by ranch work.

### The Title's Shifting Meaning

**"Tabularium Novum"** shifts across the episode:

- **Act 1:** "The New Archive" = Pliny's encyclopedia digitized. A practical upgrade. The literal meaning.
- **Act 2:** "The New Archive" = the hash table as a new way of organizing knowledge. Not just Pliny's knowledge — all knowledge. A paradigm.
- **Act 3:** "The New Archive" = Nova Roma itself. A civilization that archives what it knows, preserves what it learns, and makes its knowledge searchable by anyone. The New Archive isn't a building. It's a culture.
- **Stinger:** "The New Archive" inverted — Kirk archiving something too. What is Kirk indexing?

### Pliny and the Historical Pliny

The real Pliny the Elder wrote the *Naturalis Historia* — 37 books, 20,000 facts, the first encyclopedia. He died at Vesuvius sailing toward the eruption to rescue friends. His nephew's letters to Tacitus preserved the account. Our Pliny is that man, given eighty more years, writing a new Naturalis Historia on a new world. The show doesn't need to explain this in detail — the flashback carries it. But for viewers who know the history, the resonance is enormous: the man who died trying to record the world is alive, still recording, and now building a system so that his recording outlives him the way his nephew's letters outlived the original.

### Connection to the Series

- **Pliny's grace in making himself searchable** continues the S3 farewell arc. Every episode where Pliny enables his own replacement is a step toward his death — not with bitterness but with the satisfaction of a man whose work is finished because it can continue without him.
- **The faith conversation** is the seed of Pliny's S3 systematic interrogation of Casey. The polymath has found a new subject. He will spend the next two seasons (his remaining time) asking questions with scholarly rigor. The show's Catholic thread gains its most intellectually formidable questioner — a man who doesn't believe but finds the answers surprisingly coherent.
- **Teal'c's test failure** seeds the Ratio truth-graph. A hash table that preserves history is the first step toward a system that tracks the dependency structure of knowledge claims.
- **Methos's library observation** seeds TCP/networking (1x15) and the entire distributed systems arc. The fire always comes. One copy is never enough.
- **Midas's compass** begins the temporal investigation that leads through S1 and explodes in S2 when the team discovers what Midas actually is.
- **O'Neill's "who chose the math?"** seeds the governance crisis of S3. Who designs the systems is a political question, not just a technical one.

*The episode's thesis, which it never states: the purpose of organizing knowledge is not to control it but to set it free. Pliny's encyclopedia, trapped in forty handwritten volumes, is his private treasure. Pliny's encyclopedia, indexed and searchable, is a civilization's inheritance. The hash table is the act of generosity that turns one man's life's work into everyone's resource. Friatio — the crumbling of the key — sounds like destruction, but it is the opposite: it is the transformation that makes finding possible. You crumble the stone into powder so that the powder can lead you back to the stone. Nothing is lost. Everything is findable. That is the gift the recorder gives to the world he recorded.*
