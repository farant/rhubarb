## 1. CASEY'S FAITH THREAD: The Roman Asks About the Beads

### The Setup

The season outline is explicit: **"1x08-09: Rosary visible. Roman asks about beads."** This is Casey's episode — his flashback, his library, his central position. The faith thread must escalate without upstaging the A-plot. The key: a Roman asks a question that Casey answers simply, and the simplicity says everything.

### The Beat

**Location:** The workshop. Casey is debugging the time library — his hands are in the code, but the rosary is around his wrist. Not hidden, not displayed. Just there. A Roman engineer (suggest: one of Marcus's apprentices, someone we've seen but haven't heard from much) is working alongside Casey, helping with the sundial calibrations (the A-plot's Roman timekeeping contribution).

The Roman has been watching Casey work for hours. He's noticed the beads before — in 1x03-04, Marcus noticed but only asked "What are those?" and got "They help me count." This Roman has heard that answer secondhand. He wants more.

**ROMAN APPRENTICE:** *(working, casual)* The beads on your wrist. Marcus says they are for counting.

**CASEY:** *(still typing)* That's right.

**ROMAN APPRENTICE:** Counting what?

**CASEY:** Prayers.

**ROMAN APPRENTICE:** *(genuine curiosity — Romans count votive offerings too)* How many prayers?

**CASEY:** *(pauses his work. Looks at the rosary. A beat.)* Enough.

That's it. Five lines. But "enough" is a loaded word in an episode about time. Enough prayers, enough time, enough patience. The Roman doesn't press further. He files it the way Romans file things — this foreigner has a devotional practice involving repetitive prayer and counting. Romans understand votive repetition. It's not alien to him. It's recognizable.

### Why This Episode

Casey's faith escalation lands here because:
1. **It's Casey's episode.** He's the central character. His faith is part of who he is, and the audience should see it naturally when the camera is on him most.
2. **The rosary-as-counter resonates with the A-plot.** The episode is about measuring time — counting seconds, counting pulses, counting frequencies. Casey counts prayers. The parallel is visual and never stated.
3. **A Roman apprentice asking is a different KIND of noticing.** Previous noticers: nobody (1x01-02), Marcus (1x03-04), Pliny (1x05), nobody/camera (1x06), O'Neill (1x07). Now a Roman who isn't a named character — representing the CULTURE noticing, not just individuals. The faith thread is spreading from Casey's immediate circle into the broader community.
4. **"Enough" seeds 1x09.** The next step in the outline is a fuller exchange: "How many prayers?" / "Enough." But "enough" invites follow-up. In 1x09, the same Roman (or Pliny, who has been collecting questions) will ask: "Enough for what?" And Casey will have to answer that.

### Escalation Table Updated

| Episode | Faith Beat | Mode | Who Notices |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1x01 | Crosses himself | Visual only | Nobody |
| 1x02 | Crucifix + Data visual rhyme | Visual + compositional | Camera |
| 1x03-04 | Rosary / "What are those?" | Brief verbal — about object | Marcus |
| 1x05 | Two extended beats | Extended verbal — about faith | Pliny |
| 1x06 | Crucifix in frame | Visual — compositional REST | Nobody |
| 1x07 | Grace before meal | Brief verbal — about practice | O'Neill |
| **1x08** | **Rosary / "How many prayers?" / "Enough"** | **Brief verbal — about devotion** | **Roman apprentice (the culture)** |

The pattern: individual noticing → institutional noticing → cultural noticing. Marcus noticed as a fellow craftsman. Pliny noticed as a scholar. O'Neill noticed as a commander. Now the Romans-as-a-people are beginning to notice. The faith thread crosses from "Casey's thing" to "something the community is aware of."

### Production Note: The Rosary and the Clock

The rosary should be visually paired with timepieces throughout the episode. Both are counting instruments. Both measure something invisible. Both require patience. The camera should find moments where Casey's wrist (rosary) is in frame next to whatever clock/timer mechanism he's building. Never called out. Just composed.

## 2. KIRK STINGER: Time Is the Weapon

### The Progression So Far

| Stinger | Kirk's Step | Mirror Library | Number | Word |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|------|
| 1x01 | Seed | — | — | — |
| 1x02 | Germination (laptop, first code) | — | — | — |
| 1x03 | First root (server farm) | Chorda | — | — |
| 1x04 | First branches (strip mall, 4/31) | Xar | 4/31 | — |
| 1x05 | First organization (directory, 5/31) | Tabula Dispersa | 5/31 | TABULARIUM |
| 1x06 | First standardization (style guide, 6/31) | Internamentum | 6/31 | LEXICON |
| 1x07 | First persistence (backup, 7/31) | Filum | 7/31 | ARCHIVUM |
| **1x08** | **First scheduling (timed operations, 8/31)** | **Tempus** | **8/31** | **TEMPUS** |

### The Stinger

**Location:** Earth. Night. Kirk's office. The filing cabinets from 1x07 visible in the background. Kirk is at his desk. Two monitors. On one: a map with eight red dots (up from seven — a new acquisition). On the other: a scheduling interface. Not a calendar app — something custom-built. Military-grade.

Kirk is looking at a timeline. Events listed, color-coded. Each event has a timestamp and a duration. Meetings. Shipments. Communications blackouts. Personnel rotations. Everything timed to the second.

An aide enters.

**AIDE:** The new site is operational. Ahead of schedule.

**KIRK:** *(not looking up)* Define "ahead of schedule."

**AIDE:** Six hours.

**KIRK:** *(still looking at the timeline)* Six hours is meaningless. What matters is that it was six hours *predictable*. If I can predict six hours of variance, I can plan around it. If I can plan around it, it's not variance. It's a feature.

He adjusts something on the timeline. Two events shift. A gap closes. Something that was scheduled for next week moves to tomorrow.

**KIRK:** *(to himself, almost meditative)* They're building a clock right now. On Nova Roma. Trying to synchronize time. *(beat)* They'll discover the clocks don't match.

He opens a drawer. A watch — analog, expensive, precise. He sets it on the desk next to the monitor.

**KIRK:** Time is the one resource that can't be manufactured. It can only be allocated. And the one who allocates it controls everything.

He writes on the whiteboard: **8 / 31**

Below ARCHIVUM: **TEMPUS**

**KIRK:** *(looking at the map, the eight dots, the timeline, the watch)* They measure time to understand it. I measure time to *use* it.

SMASH TO BLACK.

### What This Means

Kirk's stinger progression: seed → germination → root → branches → organization → standardization → persistence → **scheduling**. TABULARIUM → LEXICON → ARCHIVUM → **TEMPUS**.

The escalation: Kirk has moved from *having* things (assets, files, vocabulary) to *timing* things. Scheduling is the militarization of time management. The team builds clocks to understand their world. Kirk builds schedules to control his. Same library concept — time — opposite purpose.

Kirk using the Latin word TEMPUS is significant. He's been adopting Nova Roma's vocabulary since TABULARIUM (1x05). He's not just building a parallel operation — he's building a parallel *civilization*, using the same linguistic and conceptual framework. The dark mirror deepens.

The "clocks don't match" line is a gut-punch for attentive viewers: Kirk KNOWS about the temporal anomaly, or at least suspects time behaves differently around the gate. He may have discovered this independently through his own operations. This seeds the question: does Kirk know about Midas?

## 3. C-PLOT BEATS (4 Beats Interwoven)

### Beat C1 (Act 1, Early): Earth-Side Seed — "AI-Powered Small Town"

The series arc notes: "1x08 or 1x09: A brief Earth-side scene. A news report or overheard conversation: a tech company announces an 'AI-Powered Small Town' initiative."

**Location:** The workshop. Background. Someone has brought a laptop with Earth news feeds (supply personnel who came through with Joe in 1x07 have established a small information pipeline). A news crawl visible on screen:

**CHYRON:** *"TECH GIANT ANNOUNCES 'SMART TOWN' PILOT PROGRAM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE — $14M INVESTMENT IN MUNICIPAL AI"*

Nobody comments. Nobody reads it aloud. It's background texture. O'Neill might glance at it — he tracks everything — but he's focused on the clock crisis. The camera holds on it for two seconds.

**Why:** This seeds the New Hampshire thread. In S2, this is the project Big Head runs. In S4-5, it becomes the first deployment of clean infrastructure. The seed is planted now, invisibly, the way the best serialized shows do it.

**Timing:** 3 seconds of screen time. A chyron. That's it.

### Beat C2 (Act 2-3): Carter Uses Casey's Timestamps

**The Payoff of the 1x07 Seed.** Carter saved her temporal data to disk in 1x07. She discovered a periodic frequency. But her timestamps were imprecise — she was noting "morning" and "afternoon" and rough clock readings. Now Casey is building a real time library.

Carter approaches Casey during a break in the clock synchronization work.

**CARTER:** Casey. I need precise timestamps on some measurements I've been running.

**CASEY:** What kind of measurements?

**CARTER:** *(carefully)* Compass readings. Electromagnetic fluctuations. I've been logging them since episode five — since 1x05. But my timestamps are approximate. Notebook time. "Around noon." "Late afternoon."

**CASEY:** And you need real timing.

**CARTER:** I need `tempus_nunc()` resolution. Microsecond precision. Because I think what I'm measuring has a frequency, and I can't analyze a frequency without precise time data.

**CASEY:** *(the IBM engineer, immediately understanding)* A frequency analysis without precise timestamps is like a census without addresses. You know the population but not the distribution. *(beat)* I'll give you a timestamp function you can call from your measurement code.

Carter integrates Casey's timestamp into her compass-reading loop. She runs a new measurement session — this time with real precision. The output:

```c
/* Mensura temporalis nova — praecisio microsecundalis */
f64 tempus_mensurae = tempus_nunc();
f64 lectio_acus = legere_acum_magneticam();
filum_scriptor_scribere_literis(scriptor_secretum,
    "%.6f, %.4f\n", tempus_mensurae, lectio_acus);
```

And she sees it clearly for the first time: the oscillation is periodic. Not approximately periodic — *precisely* periodic. The frequency is stable. 0.0037 Hz. One full oscillation every 270 seconds. Every four and a half minutes, the compass swings, the electromagnetic field shifts, the temporal signature of Midas's presence pulses.

**CARTER:** *(staring at the data, alone)* It's a heartbeat.

She saves the file. The new data, with Casey's precision timestamps, is the first real evidence that the temporal anomaly isn't random degradation — it's a living signal. Something is *producing* this frequency. And it's regular. And it's tied to Midas.

She doesn't tell anyone. But the word "heartbeat" hangs in the air.

**Timing:** 60–90 seconds across two scenes (the request to Casey + the private analysis).

### Beat C3 (Act 3-4): Joe/Pliny Working Session

The 1x07 thread appendix notes: **"1x08-12: Working sessions."** This is the first one.

**Location:** Pliny's villa. Day. Joe and Pliny are at a table covered with documents — Pliny's scrolls on one side, Joe's leather satchel (Watcher field journals) on the other. Wine. Bread. The *adversaria* (field notebooks) side by side.

They're not working on anything specific for the A-plot. They're *organizing*. Pliny is showing Joe how his encyclopedia is indexed. Joe is showing Pliny how Watcher Chronicles are structured: Subject → Chronicle → Entries → Observations. Each entry timestamped (relevant to the A-plot!). Each observation attributed to a specific Watcher.

**PLINY:** *(fascinated by the Chronicle structure)* Each observation is attributed? By name?

**JOE:** By Watcher designation. Anonymous in the Chronicle itself. But the organization knows who wrote what.

**PLINY:** *(disapproving)* Anonymous? A scholar should stand behind his observations. My name is on every volume. If I am wrong, they know who was wrong. This is accountability.

**JOE:** The Watchers value the observation over the observer. If the observer is named, the next reader might evaluate the observation based on who wrote it rather than what it says.

**PLINY:** *(the realist objection)* But who wrote it IS part of what it says! An observation by a careful scholar is worth more than an observation by a careless one. Stripping the name strips the epistemic weight.

**JOE:** *(a long beat — Pliny is making an argument Joe has privately agreed with for years)* ...Yeah. I've thought that too.

They're building complementary filing systems. Pliny's indexed by subject matter (encyclopedia structure). Joe's indexed by person (chronicle structure). Together they cover two axes: what happened, and who it happened to.

**Timing:** 45-60 seconds. The scene does double duty: it advances the Joe/Pliny thread AND reinforces the episode's theme (time, timestamps, attribution, the importance of WHEN something was recorded — not just WHAT).

### Beat C4 (Act 4-5 or Tag): Kirk's Earth Network — Someone Goes Dark

The season outline notes: **"1x08 C-Plot: Someone goes dark. Kirk's network growing. Time discrepancy between worlds."**

**Location:** O'Neill's quarters. He's reviewing intelligence updates from Earth (the pipeline established when Joe arrived). One of the contacts tracking Kirk's network has gone silent. Not dead — just silent. Missed two check-ins.

**O'NEILL:** *(to Joe, who has become his informal intelligence consultant)* Ramirez hasn't checked in.

**JOE:** How long?

**O'NEILL:** Two weeks. He was tracking Kirk's Seattle operation. Good man. Reliable. Never missed a check-in in three years.

**JOE:** *(the Watcher instinct — decades of experience with agents going silent)* Two options. Either he's compromised, or he's been turned.

**O'NEILL:** There's a third option.

**JOE:** *(knowing O'Neill means "dead" but not saying it)* Yeah. There is.

**O'NEILL:** The thing that bothers me: Ramirez's last transmission included a time reference. He said he was sending it "Tuesday evening." But our receipt timestamp says Wednesday morning. Six-hour gap.

**JOE:** Transmission delay?

**O'NEILL:** Through the gate? The gate is instantaneous. And Ramirez's encryption timestamps match his Tuesday. Our clocks say Wednesday.

A beat. O'Neill looks at the board where Casey is struggling with clock synchronization in the A-plot.

**O'NEILL:** Time discrepancy between Earth and Nova Roma. Casey's clocks don't match. And now Ramirez's timestamp doesn't match. *(beat)* I don't like coincidences.

**JOE:** *(carefully)* The Watchers tracked an Immortal in the 14th century who seemed to appear in two cities on the same day. We attributed it to clerical error. *(beat)* Maybe it wasn't.

This beat does three things:
1. **Advances the Kirk C-plot** — Kirk's network is growing, a contact is lost
2. **Ties into the A-plot** — the time discrepancy between worlds mirrors Casey's clock synchronization problems
3. **Seeds the Midas temporal thread** — the time gap between Earth and Nova Roma is real, measurable, and now noticed by intelligence personnel

**Timing:** 60 seconds. Dense, efficient, all business.

## 4. CARTER / TEMPORAL FREQUENCY BEAT: The Heartbeat

(Covered in C2 above, but expanded here for the compilation.)

### The Technical Escalation

| Episode | Carter's Temporal Investigation | Status |
|---------|-------------------------------|--------|
| 1x05 | Compass spins near Midas. First observation. | Noticed |
| 1x06 | More readings. Data's eye-color shifts correlated. Pattern suspected. | Tracking |
| 1x07 | Data saved to disk. Periodic frequency detected (approximate). | Persistent |
| **1x08** | **Precise timestamps via Casey's Tempus library. Frequency confirmed: 0.0037 Hz. "It's a heartbeat."** | **Measured** |

### What Carter Now Knows

1. The temporal anomaly is **periodic** — not random degradation
2. The frequency is **stable** — 0.0037 Hz, consistent across measurement sessions
3. The oscillation correlates with **Midas's proximity** — stronger when he's nearby
4. The effect is **measurable** — not subjective, not compass-spinning intuition, but hard data with microsecond timestamps
5. The pattern resembles a **biological rhythm** — "heartbeat" — not a mechanical one

### What Carter Still Doesn't Know

1. What's *producing* the signal (she suspects Midas but hasn't proven causation vs. correlation)
2. Whether the signal is *intentional* or emergent
3. Whether the time discrepancy between Earth and Nova Roma (Beat C4) is related
4. What the 270-second cycle means — is it Midas's cycle, or the artifact's?

### The Emotional Beat

Carter has been carrying this alone since 1x05. In 1x07, the burden solidified (ephemeral → persistent). Now, in 1x08, the burden becomes *scientific*. It's no longer hunches and compass readings. It's data. Publishable, verifiable, undeniable data. She can't un-know what she knows. And telling the team would mean telling Midas — and she doesn't know what that would do.

The word "heartbeat" is the emotional knife. Midas isn't a malfunctioning machine. Whatever is happening to him is *alive*. That changes the moral calculus of everything.

## 5. THREAD-BY-THREAD STATUS PROPOSALS: After 1x08

| Thread | Status After 1x08 | Next Beat |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Casey's Faith** | **ESCALATED TO CULTURE.** Roman apprentice asks about rosary beads. "How many prayers?" "Enough." The faith thread crosses from individual noticing to communal awareness. Rosary visually paired with clocks all episode — both are counting instruments. | 1x09-10: "Enough for what?" Pliny, collecting questions, asks Casey for a formal interview. Casey: "This is going to take more than one evening." |
| **Kirk Stinger** | **8/31. TEMPUS.** Kirk builds a scheduling operation. "Time is the one resource that can't be manufactured." Hints he knows about the temporal discrepancy. New acquisition (8th city). | 1x09: Kirk's stinger mirrors XML/structure. What organizational structure does Kirk build? |
| **C-Plot (Kirk/Earth)** | **CONTACT LOST.** Ramirez goes dark. Time discrepancy between his transmission and Nova Roma receipt. O'Neill and Joe working together as intelligence team. | Ongoing. More contacts go dark or go silent. Kirk's network absorbing assets. |
| **Joe Dawson** | **SETTLING IN.** First working session with Pliny. Intelligence consulting with O'Neill. Starting to build his place in Nova Roma — not as a tourist or observer but as a participant. | 1x09-12: More working sessions. Bar location identified. Joe/Methos private conversation (deferred from 1x07, due 1x09-10). |
| **Joe/Pliny Partnership** | **FIRST WORKING SESSION.** Complementary filing systems. Pliny challenges Joe on anonymous attribution. Joe privately agrees — beginning of his shift from Watcher to participant. | 1x09-12: Deeper collaboration. Pliny teaching Joe about Roman encyclopedic method. Joe teaching Pliny about longitudinal observation. By 1x13: the bar opens and becomes their second workspace. |
| **Black Stone / Cybele** | **UNCHANGED from 1x07.** No direct beat this episode. Daniel is working with his dossier but the investigation doesn't advance on-screen. | 1x09 (XML): Daniel working with structured ancient texts. Cross-referencing Watcher records. |
| **Midas Temporal** | **FREQUENCY CONFIRMED.** Carter has precise timestamps from Casey's Tempus library. 0.0037 Hz — every 270 seconds. "It's a heartbeat." The anomaly is alive, structured, biological. Plus: time discrepancy between Earth and Nova Roma noticed by O'Neill (C4). | 1x09-10: Carter begins analyzing whether the frequency shifts when Midas is in different emotional states. Does the heartbeat accelerate under stress? |
| **Nominalism / Realism** | **CASEY'S FLASHBACK IS THE NOMINALISM THREAD.** (See below, Section 8.) Each era of Casey's life = a step in the nominalist progression. The audience absorbs the thesis through biography, not argument. Additionally: clocks as realist instruments (time has a nature, it can be measured) vs. nominalist dysfunction (when nothing has a nature, you can't synchronize anything). | Ongoing. Each library deepens. |
| **Pliny's Mortality** | **BACKGROUND.** Pliny present but not spotlighted. He's energized by the working sessions with Joe — someone who shares his documentary passion. The mortality thread rests here; Pliny is too engaged to be melancholy. | Ongoing. |
| **Data/Midas Friendship** | **BACKGROUND BUT SEEDED.** Midas's temporal signature is now precisely measured. Data likely notices something about Midas's rhythms that parallels the Tempus library's concepts. The friendship continues from 1x06-07. | 1x09-10: Data may begin his own private analysis of Midas's patterns, parallel to Carter's but from a different motivation (friendship vs. science). |
| **Daniel as Investigator** | **WORKING.** Daniel continues cross-referencing Methos fragments with Watcher records. Not spotlighted this episode — Casey is the focus character. | 1x09: XML episode gives Daniel tools for structured text analysis. The investigation accelerates. |
| **Methos's Secret** | **RESTING.** Methos is present but not spotlighted. His major moments were 1x06 (Alexandria) and 1x07 (Borg-overwrite, "they rotted"). He rests here. | 1x09-10: Joe/Methos private conversation. The Watcher and the watched, alone. Wine. Late night. History. |
| **Carter's Secret Burden** | **SCIENTIFIC.** The burden is no longer emotional or intuitive — it's data. Precise, timestamped, publishable data. "It's a heartbeat" is the moral turning point. Carter can't dismiss this as an anomaly anymore. She's measuring something alive. | 1x09-10: Carter considers whether to tell someone. The data demands it. Her silence becomes harder to justify. |
| **Earth-Side Seed** | **PLANTED.** "AI-Powered Small Town" in New Hampshire chyron. Nobody notices. The audience might. | 1x09 or later: No follow-up needed until 1x10 (Gilfoyle/Dinesh introduction per season outline). |
| **Time Discrepancy** | **NEW THREAD.** O'Neill notices Ramirez's timestamp doesn't match. Six-hour gap between Earth and Nova Roma. Casey's clocks don't match in the A-plot. The time discrepancy is now flagged by intelligence, not just by the physicist. | 1x09-12: The discrepancy grows. More data points accumulate. Carter realizes the temporal frequency she's measuring may be CAUSING the time gap, not just correlating with it. |

## 6. THREAD INTERSECTION MAP

### Which Threads Touch Which Scenes

| Scene / Beat | Threads Present |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Casey debugging Tempus (workshop, throughout)** | Casey's Faith (rosary visible), Nominalism/Realism (flashback intercuts), A-plot (time library) |
| **Roman apprentice asks about beads** | Casey's Faith (escalation), Cultural Integration (Romans noticing Earth customs) |
| **Carter asks Casey for timestamps (C2a)** | Midas Temporal, Carter's Burden, A-plot (Tempus utility) |
| **Carter analyzes frequency (C2b)** | Midas Temporal, Carter's Burden, Nominalism/Realism (measurement as realist act) |
| **Joe/Pliny working session (C3)** | Joe/Pliny Partnership, Joe Dawson (settling in), Nominalism/Realism (attribution debate = realist epistemology) |
| **O'Neill/Joe intelligence review (C4)** | Kirk/Earth C-plot, Time Discrepancy (NEW), Joe as intelligence asset |
| **Casey flashback — 1850s First Death** | Casey's Faith (origin), Nominalism/Realism (Industrial Revolution as nominalist turn) |
| **Casey flashback — IBM** | Nominalism/Realism (computing born from military-industrial complex), Casey's Faith (the craft as vocation) |
| **Casey flashback — Web3 breaking point** | Nominalism/Realism (peak nominalism), Casey's Faith (the faith that kept him sane) |
| **Kirk stinger** | Kirk Stinger (8/31, TEMPUS), Time Discrepancy (Kirk hints he knows), Kirk/Earth C-plot |
| **New Hampshire chyron (C1)** | Earth-Side Seed (background, planted) |

### Intersection Density

This episode has the highest thread-intersection density since 1x05 (Tabula Dispersa). The reason: Casey IS multiple threads simultaneously. His faith thread, his flashback (which IS the nominalism thread), and his A-plot contribution (the Tempus library that enables Carter's frequency analysis) all run through the same character. This creates natural convergence without forced cross-cutting.

---

## 7. CASEY'S FLASHBACK AS NOMINALISM THREAD

### The Nominalism Progression Through One Man's Eyes

The season outline specifies Casey's flashback structure. Each era represents a nominalist escalation — things losing their natures, people becoming interchangeable, craft dying. This is the NOMINALISM THREAD for 1x08. It doesn't need a separate philosophical scene. Casey's biography IS the argument.

| Flashback Era | What Casey Sees | Nominalist Step | Realist Counterpoint |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **1850s-60s: First Death** | Industrial Revolution. Craftsmen becoming operators. "A cobbler makes shoes. A factory worker operates a machine." | Persons reduced to functions. Work stripped of nature. | Casey's own trade — whatever it was before computing — was SOMETHING. He was a craftsman. He remembers being something. |
| **Early 1900s: Taylorism** | Efficiency lecture. People measured, optimized, timed. Stopwatches everywhere. | People as machines to be optimized. Time itself becomes a tool of control. | Casey walks out. He can't articulate why, but being timed feels wrong. (Seeds the A-plot: Casey building a clock that RESPECTS time rather than weaponizing it.) |
| **1950s-70s: IBM** | Computing born from the military-industrial complex. Punch cards, mainframes. But the CRAFT is real. | Institutions use computing as control. But the engineering itself has integrity. | Casey respects the craft. He argues for length-prefixed strings (1x03 callback). He's a craftsman in a system that doesn't value craft, but the craft itself is honest. |
| **2010s: Web3** | Peak nominalism. "Decentralized governance for... something. Tokenized... something else." | Nothing has a nature. Everything is a platform. Words mean nothing. | Casey's breaking point. He leaves. He goes to Duncan. He starts building from scratch. The faith that kept him sane for 160 years now has to carry him through the realization that the entire industry was a nominalist project from the beginning. |

### The Thread's Architecture

The flashback is INTERCUT with the A-plot. Each era lands between acts. The audience experiences Casey's 160-year biography of watching craft die, and then returns to the present where he is building the most fundamental craft object in computing: a clock. A way to measure time honestly. The contrast between the flashback's nominalist progression and the present's realist construction is the episode's philosophical architecture.

**The rosary is in every era.** In the 1850s, it's in his pocket. At IBM, it's in his desk drawer. At the Web3 startup, it's around his wrist. On Nova Roma, it's around his wrist AND visible. The rosary's visibility tracks Casey's willingness to be openly Catholic — from hidden (dangerous), to private (professional), to visible (among friends). 160 years of a man's faith, told through the placement of a string of beads.

## 8. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR COMPILATION

1. **Casey flashback — how many eras on screen?** The season outline lists four eras (1850s, early 1900s, 1950s-70s, 2010s). That's a LOT of flashback for one episode. Should we do all four, or select two or three and save the rest for later episodes or a Casey-focused bottle episode? The Taylorism beat (early 1900s) specifically resonates with the time theme; the IBM beat connects to 1x03; the Web3 beat is the breaking point. The 1850s First Death might be saved for a bigger moment.

2. **Carter's frequency number — 0.0037 Hz / 270 seconds.** Is this the right number? It should feel biological (heartbeat-adjacent) but not literally a heartbeat frequency (1-2 Hz). I've pitched 270 seconds (4.5 minutes) as a slow, deep rhythm — more like a whale's breathing pattern or a tidal cycle than a heartbeat. The word "heartbeat" is metaphorical, not literal. But the compilation should confirm whether this number has downstream implications.

3. **Kirk's "clocks don't match" line.** Does Kirk know about Midas specifically, or just about the temporal discrepancy generally? I've pitched it as ambiguous — Kirk knows SOMETHING about time being wrong between worlds, but the audience doesn't know if he knows about Midas. The compilation should decide: is Kirk ahead of the team on the temporal mystery, or just noticing the same symptoms?

4. **Joe/Methos private conversation.** The 1x07 thread appendix flagged: "Deferred Joe/Methos reunion: 1x09 or 1x10. Private. Late night. Wine." Should any Joe/Methos proximity be in 1x08, or save it entirely? I've kept them separate in this pitch — Joe is with Pliny and O'Neill, Methos is background. But if the character writer has a beat where they cross paths briefly, that could land.

5. **The New Hampshire chyron placement.** The series arc says "1x08 or 1x09." I've placed it in 1x08 because it fits naturally in the C-plot reel (background news during workshop scenes). But if the A-plot is already dense with Casey flashbacks + time library + clock crisis, the chyron could wait for 1x09 where there might be more visual breathing room.

6. **Time Discrepancy as new thread vs. existing thread.** I've flagged the O'Neill/Ramirez timestamp gap as a "new thread" but it's really a facet of the Midas Temporal thread viewed from the intelligence angle. Should it be tracked separately (for clarity) or folded into Midas Temporal (for simplicity)?

7. **The rosary across eras.** The flashback rosary placement (pocket → drawer → wrist → visible) tells a 160-year story. But does the character writer have a different plan for what Casey carries through his flashback? Need to align.
