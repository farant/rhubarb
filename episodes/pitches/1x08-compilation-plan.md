## A. STRUCTURAL DECISIONS

### Beat Count and Act Structure

**Recommendation: 22 beats** (Cold Open + 5 Acts + Tag + Stinger, with 4 C-Plot beats interwoven).

The A-plot writer's act structure is the backbone. Five acts with clear names and emotional progression:

| Section | Beats | Content |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Cold Open | 1 | Casey working alone before dawn. Tempus initialized. "Casey scripsit." |
| Act One: "Pulsus" (The Pulse) | Beats 1-4 | Carter's timestamp request. Frame loop. Easing functions. Spring physics. |
| Act Two: "Unda" (The Wave) | Beats 5-8 | Wave functions. Frame statistics. Carter's frequency analysis. Interpolation/color. |
| Act Three: "Duo Horologia" (Two Clocks) | Beats 9-12 | Independent clocks. The drift. Casey's frustration. Casey and Carter — the revelation. |
| Act Four: "Circumvolvere" (To Wrap Around) | Beats 13-16 | Casey accepts the drift. Timestamps on shifting ground. Utility functions. Teal'c's test suite. |
| Act Five: "Horologium Verum" (The True Clock) | Beats 17-19 | Completed library. Title moment. Test visualization. |
| Tag | Beats 20-21 | Carter/Casey evening walk. Data/Casey quiet scene. |
| Stinger | Beat 22 | Kirk's stinger. |
| C-Plot | Beats C1-C4 | Earth-side chyron. Carter's precise timestamps. Joe/Pliny working session. O'Neill/Ramirez intelligence. |

## B. CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### Conflict 1: Kirk Stinger Word — CHRONOGRAPHIA vs. TEMPUS vs. HOROLOGIUM

**A-plot pitch:** CHRONOGRAPHIA. Kirk watching temporal signature through gate telemetry. Two clocks (analog + digital). "Time tells." 8/31.

**Threads pitch:** TEMPUS. Kirk with a scheduling interface. "Time is the one resource that can't be manufactured." 8/31.

**Genre pitch:** HOROLOGIUM. Kirk analyzing gate telemetry timestamp discrepancies. "Time should be the one thing that's the same everywhere." 8/31.

**DECISION: Use CHRONOGRAPHIA (A-plot), with elements from the threads writer's scheduling dimension and the genre fan's gate telemetry.**

Reasoning:

1. **CHRONOGRAPHIA** is the strongest word because it's a DIFFERENT word from the episode title. The team calls their achievement HOROLOGIUM. Kirk calls his operation CHRONOGRAPHIA. This is the dark-mirror divergence: the team builds a clock (horologium = an instrument that tells). Kirk builds a timeline (chronographia = a record that tracks). Same root phenomenon. Different purposes. Stinger progression: TABULARIUM → LEXICON → ARCHIVUM → CHRONOGRAPHIA. Each word escalates: indexing → standardizing → persisting → *timing*.

2. **TEMPUS** would be too on-the-nose — it's the library's name. Kirk should shadow the team's concepts but use different terminology, the way ARCHIVUM shadowed Filum.

3. **HOROLOGIUM** matching the episode title would collapse the dark-mirror effect. The whole point is that Kirk names things differently.

4. From the A-plot writer: Kirk should have the Midas temporal profile file, the analog stopwatch vs. digital clock parallel, and the question "Biological?" — this is the stinger's gut-punch. Kirk suspects what Carter suspects.

5. From the threads writer: Kirk's scheduling dimension — timed operations, the operational use of time rather than the scientific study of it. Add his line: "They measure time to understand it. I measure time to *use* it." (Adapted.)

6. From the genre fan: Kirk analyzing gate telemetry timestamp discrepancies. This is how Kirk detects the anomaly from the OUTSIDE. Carter detects it from the inside with instruments. Kirk detects it from intercepted gate signals.

**Final stinger structure:**
- Synthesis Dynamics office (established 1x06). Monitoring station. Kirk alone.
- Two screens: one showing intercepted gate telemetry sine wave, one showing standard Earth clock.
- Kirk circles the frequency. "The anomaly has a pulse."
- Opens physical Midas temporal profile folder. Writes: "Freq: 0.0037 Hz. Sinusoidal. Consistent. Biological?"
- Sets analog stopwatch next to digital clock. "Two clocks. Let's see if they agree."
- Writes on whiteboard: **8 / 31**
- Below ARCHIVUM: **CHRONOGRAPHIA**
- "Time tells. It always tells."
- SMASH TO BLACK.

### Conflict 2: Casey's Faith Beat — "What do you count?" vs. Roman Apprentice + Rosary/Clock Parallel

**Character pitch:** Marcus asks about the beads. "What do you count?" Casey: "That I'm not in charge." Marcus reads it as pietas.

**Threads pitch:** A Roman apprentice (not Marcus) asks. "How many prayers?" Casey: "Enough." Rosary visually paired with timepieces throughout. The culture noticing, not just individuals.

**DECISION: Use the threads writer's version (Roman apprentice, "Enough") as the PRIMARY beat, and fold the character writer's "That I'm not in charge" into a SECOND, shorter exchange with Marcus.**

Reasoning:

1. The threads writer's escalation logic is correct: we've had individual noticers (Marcus, Pliny, O'Neill). An unnamed Roman apprentice represents the CULTURE noticing. This is a new stage — the faith thread crossing from "Casey's thing" to "something the community is aware of."

2. "Enough" is the better answer for the first exchange because it's INCOMPLETE. It invites follow-up ("Enough for what?") which the threads writer correctly seeds for 1x09. It's the Nightcrawler approach — visual, brief, mysterious.

3. But "That I'm not in charge" is too good to lose. It's Casey's deepest self-understanding — the precision engineer who reminds himself he's not in charge. This should come LATER in the episode, after the clock crisis, when Marcus and Casey have a quiet moment and Marcus circles back. Marcus files "Enough" in the first scene, then returns to it after watching Casey struggle with the temporal drift. "You said 'enough.' Enough of what?" And Casey, having just been humbled by a universe that won't cooperate: "Reminders. That I'm not in charge."

4. The rosary-as-timepiece visual pairing (threads writer) is essential. Both are counting instruments. Both measure something invisible. Camera should find moments where rosary and clock/timer mechanisms are in frame together. Never called out.

**Two faith beats:**
- **Beat F1 (Act 1-2, during teaching scene):** Roman apprentice. "The beads on your wrist." "Counting what?" "Prayers." "How many?" "Enough." Five lines. Done.
- **Beat F2 (Act 4, after Casey accepts the drift):** Marcus circles back. "You said 'enough.' Enough of what?" Casey: "Reminders. That I'm not in charge." Marcus reads it as pietas. Done.

### Conflict 3: Three-Voice Algorithm Moment — Three Candidate Trios

**Character pitch Option A:** Casey / Carter / Marcus — "What is time for?" Craft → Science → Civics.

**Character pitch Option B:** Casey / Methos / Pliny — "200 years / 5000 years / 80 years."

**Genre pitch:** Casey / Methos / Data — "Time as biography / time as density / time as the gap between measurement and experience."

**DECISION: Use the genre fan's CASEY / METHOS / DATA trio as the three-voice moment. Fold the character writer's Option A (Casey / Carter / Marcus) into the title moment scene (Beat 18) as a natural discussion. Save Option B for a separate evening scene or defer.**

Reasoning:

1. Casey MUST be in the three-voice moment. It's his episode. Non-negotiable.

2. The genre fan's trio is the strongest because it gives three fundamentally DIFFERENT temporal experiences: biographical (Casey, 200 years), existential-dense (Methos, 5000 years), and measured-vs-felt (Data, an android whose chronometer is perfect but whose experience isn't). This is the most philosophical and the most aligned with the Tempus library's thesis that time has SHAPE.

3. The 1x07 three-voice was Joe / Pliny / Data. Data was the anchor — the one who delivers the knockout line. In 1x08, Data should be the THIRD voice again, because his role is to provide the unexpected perspective. Casey speaks from the body. Methos speaks from the abyss. Data speaks from the gap between measurement and experience.

4. The character writer's Option A (Casey / Carter / Marcus) is excellent but it's a TECHNICAL three-voice (precision / context / public good) that naturally emerges during the horologium naming scene (Beat 18) — it doesn't need to be a formal algorithm moment. Let it live in the title scene as organic dialogue.

5. Option B (Casey / Methos / Pliny) is beautiful — "I have what I have. And I would not trade my eighty years for your thousands" — but giving Pliny a three-voice in consecutive episodes (1x07 and 1x08) overexposes him. Save for later.

**Three-voice placement:** Late Act 4 or early Act 5, after the utility functions scene where Methos speaks for the first time ("Remapping. That's what translation is."). The three-voice grows organically from that conversation.

**Structure:**
- **Casey:** "Time isn't constant. Some years take a decade. Some decades pass in an afternoon. The easing functions aren't abstractions. They're what time actually feels like. `lenire_retro_ingressus` — pulls backward before moving forward. That's memory."
- **Methos:** "Five thousand years. Most of it is waiting. Time isn't long or short. It's dense or sparse. The constant one — `lenire_linearis` — that one is a lie."
- **Data:** "My internal chronometer records time at nanosecond precision. Each second is identical. And yet — when I am engaged in conversation with Midas, or solving a problem with Carter — something is not. I believe the easing functions describe something my chronometer cannot measure. Something that exists between the ticks."

### Conflict 4: Carter's Frequency Number — 0.0037 Hz / 270 Seconds

**A-plot pitch:** 0.0037 Hz, ~270 seconds, explicitly confirmed.

**Threads pitch:** 0.0037 Hz / 270 seconds, confirmed. Characterized as "heartbeat" — metaphorical, not literal.

**Genre pitch:** Doesn't specify a number but references the periodic frequency from 1x07.

**Historian pitch:** No specific number.

**DECISION: CONFIRMED — 0.0037 Hz / ~270 seconds / ~4.5 minutes. Consensus across all pitches that specify it.**

The threads writer's framing is correct: "heartbeat" is metaphorical. 270 seconds is a deep autonomic rhythm — more like whale breathing or tidal cycling than a literal heartbeat (1-2 Hz). The biological metaphor is what makes it unsettling: this frequency implies something ALIVE is generating it.

The A-plot writer's detail that the R² = 0.94 (sine fit) and the square wave fit is worse (71%) should be kept — it demonstrates Carter's analytical process and rules out a binary on/off mechanism. The anomaly is smooth. Organic. Breathing, not switching.

### Conflict 5: Casey's "Huh. That's better." — What Triggers It

**Character pitch:** Carter proposes independent clocks with shared frequency (the `tempus_creare` architecture). Casey's instinct is to reject. He reads it again. "Huh. That's better."

**A-plot pitch:** Doesn't use the exact phrase but has the same turning point: Casey accepting that Carter's "it's not a bug, it's a property of the place" reframes his precision.

**DECISION: Use the character writer's version for WHEN it lands and WHAT triggers it, but merge it with the A-plot writer's larger acceptance arc.**

Reasoning:

1. The character writer's moment is crisper and more specific: Casey sees Carter's independent-clocks-with-shared-frequency design and admits it's better than his single-global-clock approach. "Huh. That's better." Four words. Turning point.

2. But this should happen DURING the collaboration sequence (Act 2-3), not as the climactic acceptance. The climactic acceptance is the A-plot's Beat 13: Casey writing "Not a defect — a property of the place." The "Huh. That's better" is Casey's FIRST opening. The documentation comment is his FULL acceptance.

3. **Placement:** During the Casey/Carter design session (Act 2), when Carter proposes independent clocks. Casey resists. Reads it again. "Huh. That's better." / Carter: "It's both of ours." This is the first crack in the hermit's isolation. The full break comes later when he accepts the temporal drift.

### Conflict 6: Flashback Structure — Full 4-Era Sequence or Compressed?

**Character pitch:** Four eras — 1858 Manchester (First Death, cobbler), 1911 Philadelphia (Taylor lecture), 1957 IBM (core dumps, Mrs. Patterson), 2019 San Francisco (Web3 breaking point). Each intercut with present-day. Hand-motif rhyme throughout.

**Threads pitch:** All four eras on screen. Each maps to nominalist progression. Questions whether all four fit in one episode.

**Genre pitch:** All four eras, each as a genre homage with distinct visual language (sepia/noir/Technicolor/blue-tinted).

**Historian pitch:** Provides historical grounding for each era (Industrial Revolution, Taylorism, IBM computing, Web3 timestamp verification).

**DECISION: THREE eras on screen — cut the First Death to a brief visual fragment. Save the full First Death for a later Casey-focused episode.**

Reasoning:

1. Four full flashback eras is TOO MUCH for an episode that also has a dense A-plot (47-function library build + clock crisis + temporal anomaly reveal), four C-plot beats, a three-voice moment, and a stinger. The episode would run long or feel rushed.

2. The First Death (1858 Manchester, cobbler) is the biggest, most consequential flashback — it introduces Casey's immortality, his origin story, his first wound. Compressing it into 60-90 seconds wastes it. It deserves a full treatment in a Casey-focused episode (possibly 1x15-16 where he teaches, or a later season).

3. **What to show:**
   - **Taylor Lecture (1911)** — 60-90 seconds. The walkout. Taylorism as stopwatch tyranny. This resonates with the time library. Casey watching someone weaponize time measurement. Place in Act 2, during synchronization/measurement discussion.
   - **IBM (1957)** — 90-120 seconds. Casey at the drafting table. Mrs. Patterson's social security number. "Someone has to remember there are people in the machine." The warmest flashback — Casey at his happiest. Place in Act 3, intercut with Casey/Carter collaboration. His happiest era mirrors his current return to happiness.
   - **Web3 (2019)** — 90-120 seconds. The WeWork. "What does it *do*?" "...Anything?" The breaking point. The erased whiteboard. Place late Act 3 or early Act 4, just before Casey's acceptance. The breaking point that CAUSED his isolation, immediately before the moment that HEALS it.

4. The First Death gets a FRAGMENT only — a 5-10 second flash during the Cold Open or Act 1. Casey's hands on the keyboard cut to Casey's hands on cobbler's leather cut BACK. A glimpse. Enough for the audience to know there's more. Saves the full treatment.

5. The hand motif (character writer) works with three eras. Cobbler's hands on leather (fragment) → Engineer's hands on printout → Coder's hands on keyboard → Casey's hands on Tempus code. The rhyme still lands.

### Conflict 7: Casey Entering the Conspiracy of Silence

**A-plot pitch:** Carter explicitly shows Casey her file — the compass data, the periodic frequency. Casey: "That's the same frequency." Carter: "Whatever is distorting the compass is also distorting time." Casey becomes the second person to know. Full conspiracy-of-silence induction.

**Threads pitch:** Carter asks Casey for precise timestamps on "compass readings." Casey doesn't know the full picture. Carter uses his tools for her private analysis. The word "heartbeat."

**Character pitch:** Casey and Carter collaborate on the design. Casey doesn't know about the anomaly — but his precision serves Carter's secret investigation without either knowing it.

**DECISION: Use the A-plot writer's full conspiracy induction. Casey learns about the Midas temporal anomaly.**

Reasoning:

1. The A-plot writer's version is dramatically the strongest. When Casey's clocks show the SAME frequency Carter has been tracking since 1x05, the natural dramatic beat is for Carter to reveal her data. The coincidence is too precise for Carter to ignore — she NEEDS a collaborator now.

2. Casey entering the conspiracy of silence is a season-arc milestone. Carter has been carrying this alone since 1x05. Adding Casey changes the burden from "one scientist's secret" to "a partnership with shared knowledge." This parallels Casey's larger episode arc: from alone to together.

3. The threads writer's "heartbeat" moment should belong to Carter in her PRIVATE C-plot scene (Beat C2), before she tells Casey. The sequence: Carter analyzes her data privately with Casey's tools → discovers the precise frequency → says "It's a heartbeat" to herself → LATER, when Casey's clocks show the same frequency, she decides to share. The conspiracy induction happens in the A-plot's Act 3, Beat 12.

4. **What Casey learns:** The compass anomaly since 1x05. The periodic frequency (0.0037 Hz). The sine fit. That it's centered on Midas. That it's temporal, not just magnetic. He becomes the second person to know. His reaction is the craftsman's reaction: "Can I build a clock that works here?" Carter: "You already did."

### Conflict 8: Midas Present-Day Scene — Include or Cut?

**Character pitch:** Midas tells a time story about Herodotus's sundial disagreeing by an hour. Comedy beat + temporal anomaly plant.

**Other pitches:** Midas in background. No dedicated scene.

**DECISION: INCLUDE the Midas beat as a brief moment (30 seconds), placed during the easing functions demonstration in Act 1.**

Reasoning:

1. The Midas beat serves two functions: (a) comedy relief in a technically dense act, and (b) a temporal anomaly plant hiding in plain sight. WHY did Herodotus's sundial disagree? Because Midas was there. The audience who knows about the temporal anomaly will re-read this line on rewatch. That's the reward structure the show has built.

2. Keep it to 30 seconds. Midas wanders through, cheerful, drops the anecdote, wanders out. He's the social glue of Nova Roma. He doesn't have a scene this episode — his spotlight was 1x06. Here he's a brief, warm, unknowing presence whose very existence is the mystery everyone else is investigating.

### Conflict 9: Joe/Casey Mirror Scene — Include or Defer?

**Character pitch:** Joe and Casey at a tavern. "Both experts in solitude." "What made you stop watching?" "I came here." "Yeah. Me too."

**DECISION: INCLUDE, but as a brief Tag beat (45-60 seconds), placed within or adjacent to Beat 20/21.**

Reasoning:

1. The scene is excellent and thematically aligned — two men who chose isolation for different reasons, both discovering they don't want to be alone anymore. It mirrors Casey's A-plot arc perfectly.

2. But it can't be a full scene — the Tag already has Casey/Carter and Data/Casey. Making the Tag three scenes risks bloat. Compress the Joe/Casey scene to its essential exchange. Joe's corner of the tavern. Wine offered. "What made you stop watching?" "I came here." "Yeah. Me too." Done. 30-45 seconds.

3. **Alternatively**, fold it into the Data/Casey scene: Joe is at the tavern when Casey arrives. Brief exchange with Joe → Joe leaves → Data arrives. This saves a scene transition and uses the tavern location once instead of twice.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Place the Joe/Casey exchange at the START of the Tag, before the Carter/Casey walk. Three beats: Joe/Casey tavern (30 sec) → Carter/Casey walk (the main tag) → Data/Casey workshop (the quiet close).

### Conflict 10: Teal'c's Temporal Discrepancy Near Midas

**Character pitch:** Teal'c discovers the global clock and independent clocks report different elapsed times near Midas. Doesn't report it. Seeds the temporal thread from a testing perspective.

**Threads pitch:** No specific Teal'c temporal beat.

**A-plot pitch:** Teal'c's test suite is clean — 22 VERITAS. His observation: "The disagreement is between them and the universe. That is not a failing of the clocks."

**Genre pitch:** Teal'c should have a "Window of Opportunity" callback — "I have experience with unreliable time."

**DECISION: Use the A-plot writer's test suite (22 VERITAS) with the genre fan's "Window of Opportunity" callback. CUT the character writer's independent Teal'c temporal discovery near Midas — it overlaps too much with Carter's C-plot.**

Reasoning:

1. Two parallel independent temporal investigations (Carter AND Teal'c) in the same episode is redundant. Carter's frequency confirmation is the C-plot engine. Teal'c's contribution should be philosophical (testing) and referential ("Window of Opportunity"), not investigative.

2. The genre fan's callback is too good to cut: when the clocks disagree, Teal'c pauses. "I have... experience with unreliable time." O'Neill: "Don't remind me." Two lines. The fans scream. Everyone else sees a character moment. Place this in Act 3 during the drift discovery.

3. Teal'c's test suite (A-plot, Beat 16) is his centerpiece this episode. His observation — "The disagreement is between them and the universe. That is not a failing of the clocks" — carries the weight of a Jaffa who understands systems that are just within unjust contexts.

### Conflict 11: O'Neill / Ramirez Time Discrepancy — Include or Defer?

**Threads pitch:** O'Neill discovers a timestamp discrepancy between Ramirez's transmission and Nova Roma receipt (six-hour gap). "I don't like coincidences." Seeds Earth/Nova Roma time differential.

**Other pitches:** No parallel scene.

**DECISION: INCLUDE as C-Plot Beat C4, but trim to 45 seconds and simplify.**

Reasoning:

1. The scene does triple duty: advances Kirk C-plot (contact goes dark), ties into A-plot (time discrepancy mirrors Casey's clock problem), and seeds the Midas temporal thread from the intelligence angle. That's excellent efficiency.

2. But the "six-hour gap" is too large — it would imply the temporal anomaly is huge, which conflicts with the A-plot's "four nanoseconds of drift." The discrepancy should be smaller and more ambiguous. Change to: Ramirez's timestamp is off by "minutes, not seconds." O'Neill: "Through the gate? Transmission should be instantaneous." This is enough to flag the anomaly without inflating its scale.

3. Joe as O'Neill's intelligence consultant in this scene works perfectly and continues the thread from 1x07 Beat C1.

## C. KEY SCENE DECISIONS

### Cold Open: Casey Working Alone Before Dawn
**Use A-plot writer entirely.** Casey at the terminal. Crucifix on wall. Rosary on desk. He types `tempus_initiare()`. Gets the first reading. Writes the library header: "Casey scripsit. Ad usum Nova Roma." The hermit claims his work. SMASH TO MAIN TITLES.
**Who:** Casey alone.

### Beat 1: Carter's Timestamp Request (Act 1)
**Use A-plot writer.** Carter at the board. Files saved in 1x07 have no dates. "When was it written? We don't know." Marcus: "A record without a date is evidence without a witness." Casey volunteers. The full Tempus seven-section outline on the board.
**Who:** Carter, Marcus, Casey, full team.

### Beat 2: The First Frame Loop (Act 1)
**Use A-plot writer.** Casey builds the frame loop live. `tempus_quadrum()`, `tempus_delta()`, `tempus_exspectare_quadrum()`. Data immediately grasps decoupled timing. Marcus: "The Roman hour varies by season... the hour is the delta."
**Who:** Casey, Data, Marcus.

### Beat 3: Easing Functions — Philosophy of Motion (Act 1)
**Use A-plot writer + historian's Roman hour resonance.** Three dots, three curves. Linear/cubic/elastic. Pliny fascinated by elastic overshoot. Marcus: "That is how a cart stops." Lucia names them: "Lenire — to soften." Add Midas wandering through with his Herodotus sundial anecdote (character writer, compressed to 30 sec).
**Who:** Casey, Pliny, Marcus, Lucia, Daniel, (Midas brief).

### Beat F1: Roman Apprentice and the Rosary (Interwoven, Act 1-2)
**Threads writer's version.** During the easing functions teaching scene. Roman apprentice notices beads. "Counting what?" "Prayers." "How many?" "Enough." Five lines.
**Who:** Casey, Roman apprentice.

### Beat 4: ACT BREAK — Spring Physics (Act 1)
**Use A-plot writer.** `elastrum_ad()`. Marcus: "This is the principle of the arch." Casey: "Nobody has ever described spring physics to me in terms of an arch. That's better than my explanation." The hermit accepts someone else's framing for the first time. Carter notices.
**Who:** Casey, Marcus, Carter.

### Beat 5: Wave Functions (Act 2)
**Use A-plot writer.** Four waveforms on screen. Sine, triangle, sawtooth, square. Casey: "Sine is nature. Triangle is mechanical. Sawtooth is accumulation and reset. Square is binary." Pliny: "The third one — the motion of the sea. I watched the sea from the ship while the sky burned." Noise function. Data: "A useful illusion."
**Who:** Casey, Pliny, Data.

### Beat 6: Frame Statistics (Act 2)
**Use A-plot writer.** `StatisticaeQuadri`. The machine measures itself. 60 FPS target. Consistent. Carter: "Casey — can I borrow your wave functions?"
**Who:** Casey, Teal'c, Carter.

### Beat C2 (Interwoven, Act 2): Carter's Precise Frequency Analysis
**Combine A-plot writer (Beat 7) and threads writer (Beat C2).** Carter alone. Uses Casey's wave functions + Filum from 1x07 + Piscina from 1x01. Fits sine wave to compass data. Frequency: 0.0037 Hz. Period: ~270 seconds. R² = 0.94. Square wave fit worse (71%). Not binary — sinusoidal. Like breathing. "It has a pulse." / "It's a heartbeat." Saves analysis to disk. Three libraries from three episodes in one scene.
**Who:** Carter alone.
**Timing:** 60-90 seconds.

### Beat 7: "Huh. That's Better." (Act 2)
**Character writer's turning point, placed during the Casey/Carter design session.** Carter proposes independent clocks with shared frequency. Casey resists. Reads it again. "Huh. That's better." / Carter: "It's both of ours." First crack in the hermit's armor.
**Who:** Casey, Carter.

### Beat 8: ACT BREAK — Interpolation and Color (Act 2)
**Use A-plot writer.** `interpolare`, `gradus_lenis`, `cohibere`, `interpolare_colorem`. Marcus: keystone, mortar, boundary wall. Pliny delighted by the dawn gradient. "The machine can describe dawn."
**Who:** Casey, Marcus, Pliny.

### Flashback 1: Taylor Lecture (Interwoven, Act 2)
**Character writer, 60-90 seconds.** 1911 Philadelphia. Taylor on stage. "The One Best Way." Casey in the audience, watching people nod. Casey walks out. Door closes. The rhyme with the Web3 walkout will land later.
**Who:** Casey, Taylor (non-speaking crowd).

### Beat 9: Independent Clocks (Act 3)
**Use A-plot writer.** Two clocks created from same arena. Initialized same instant. After 10 seconds: 4 nanoseconds difference. "Crystal oscillator jitter. Normal. Acceptable." Carter: "Can you run them longer?"
**Who:** Casey, Carter.

### Beat 10: The Drift (Act 3)
**Use A-plot writer.** Clocks run for minutes. Dots visualized with easing functions. Around minute three, one pulls ahead. Oscillating. Sinusoidal. Casey: "That's not jitter." He measures: 0.0037 Hz. Carter says nothing. The audience has seen this number before. Add genre fan's callback: Teal'c pauses. "I have... experience with unreliable time." O'Neill: "Don't remind me."
**Who:** Casey, Carter, O'Neill, Teal'c.

### Beat 11: Casey's Frustration (Act 3)
**Use A-plot writer.** Casey tears the system apart. Resets, re-syncs. Drift returns. Tests single clock, two readings. Normal. Tests global vs. independent. Sinusoidal drift. "The crystal is faithfully oscillating in local spacetime." Data: "It is time that is inconsistent." Casey: "The clock isn't broken. The planet is."
**Who:** Casey, Data.

### Flashback 2: IBM (Interwoven, Act 3)
**Character writer, 90-120 seconds.** 1957 Poughkeepsie. Casey teaching a junior engineer core memory dumps. "See this? This is Mrs. Patterson's social security number." "Someone has to remember there are people in the machine." The warmest flashback. Casey at his happiest. Military officer visible through window — the trajectory.
**Who:** Casey, Junior Engineer.

### Beat 12: Casey and Carter — The Revelation (Act 3 Break)
**Use A-plot writer.** Carter pulls Casey aside. Shows him her file. The compass data. 0.0037 Hz. "That's the same frequency." Carter: "The compass and the clocks are detecting the same phenomenon." Carter: "It's centered on Midas." Casey: "Can I build a clock that works here?" Carter: "You already did. The clock works. It reports what's real." THE TURNING POINT. Casey enters the conspiracy of silence.
**Who:** Casey, Carter.

### Flashback 3: Web3 (Interwoven, late Act 3)
**Character writer, 90-120 seconds.** 2019 San Francisco. WeWork. The pitch. "The underlying asset is irrelevant." Casey: "What does it *do*?" Founder: "...Anything?" Casey: "Every time someone says 'it can be anything,' it turns out to be nothing." He walks out. (Same walkout as Taylor.) Erases the whiteboard. "Decentralized Everything" disappears. Clean. Breaking point.
**Who:** Casey, Founder.

### Beat 13: Casey Accepts the Drift (Act 4)
**Use A-plot writer.** Casey returns to workshop. Doesn't rewrite the library. Adds a comment: "Hoc non est defectus — est proprietas loci." / "This is not a defect — it is a property of the place." Enormous for Casey. The man who left Web3 because foundations were rotten now writes documentation that says "the foundation moves, and that's okay."
**Who:** Casey alone.

### Beat F2: Marcus and the Rosary — "That I'm Not in Charge" (Act 4)
**Compiled from character and threads writers.** After Casey writes the drift documentation. Marcus finds him. "You said 'enough.' I asked someone what you meant. They said you count prayers." Casey: "I do." Marcus: "You build clocks that measure in microseconds. You count prayers. What are you counting FOR?" Casey: "Reminders. That I'm not in charge." Marcus files it — pietas. The engineer who counts to sub-microsecond accuracy, reminding himself he's not in charge.
**Who:** Casey, Marcus.

### Beat 14: Timestamps on Shifting Ground (Act 4)
**Use A-plot writer.** Carter and Casey build timestamps on top of Tempus. Timestamps report local time. Ordering preserved even if intervals warped. Casey: "Sequence is enough. For now." Marcus: intercalary problem parallel. "Record faithfully, adjust when you can, trust the sequence."
**Who:** Casey, Carter, Marcus.

### Beat 15: Utility Functions (Act 4)
**Use A-plot writer.** `circumvolvere` (wrap), `oscillare` (oscillate), `remappare` (remap). Marcus: sundial wrapping. Methos: "Remapping. That's what translation is. I've been doing that for five thousand years. Nice to see a function for it." First Methos line of the episode — sardonic, earned, light.
**Who:** Casey, Marcus, Methos.

### Three-Voice Algorithm Moment (Late Act 4)
**Genre fan's trio: Casey / Methos / Data.** Grows organically from the utility functions scene. Casey on time as biographical experience. Methos on time as existential density ("Most of it is WAITING"). Data on the gap between his chronometer and his experience ("Something that exists between the ticks").
**Who:** Casey, Methos, Data.

### Beat 16: Teal'c's Test Suite (Act 4 Break)
**Use A-plot writer.** 22 tests. 22 VERITAS. Teal'c's observation: "The disagreement is between them and the universe. That is not a failing of the clocks."
**Who:** Teal'c, Casey.

### Beat 17: The Completed Library (Act 5)
**Use A-plot writer.** Full Tempus API on the board. 47 functions. Carter: "The most honest time library ever written." Casey: "I don't ship broken tools. But I don't lie about what they measure, either."
**Who:** Casey, Carter.

### Beat 18: The Title Moment (Act 5)
**Use A-plot writer + character writer's Marcus/horologium history.** Dependency tree on the board (three branches now). Casey: "The first library that exists in time rather than in space." Marcus names the horologium — the Horologium Augusti, public institution, shared clock. Add the historian's detail: Marcus knows the Horologium Augusti was wrong for thirty years. "A wrong public clock is better than no public clock." Casey: "The drift is data." Marcus: "The drift is evidence." Casey writes on the board: HOROLOGIUM.
**Who:** Casey, Carter, Marcus, full team.

### Beat C3 (Interwoven, Act 3-4): Joe/Pliny Working Session
**Threads writer's version.** Pliny's villa. Joe and Pliny organizing. Comparing chronicle methodologies. Pliny: "Each observation is attributed? By name?" Joe: "By Watcher designation. Anonymous." Pliny: "But who wrote it IS part of what it says!" Joe: "...Yeah. I've thought that too." Building complementary filing systems — Pliny by subject, Joe by person. Reinforces the timestamp/attribution theme.
**Who:** Joe, Pliny.
**Timing:** 45-60 seconds.

### Beat C1 (Background, Act 1): Earth-Side Chyron
**Threads writer.** Laptop with news feed visible in workshop background. Chyron: "TECH GIANT ANNOUNCES 'SMART TOWN' PILOT PROGRAM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE." Nobody comments. 3 seconds. Seeds the New Hampshire thread.
**Who:** Background.
**Timing:** 3 seconds.

### Beat C4 (Act 4-5): O'Neill / Intelligence — Ramirez Goes Dark
**Threads writer, trimmed.** O'Neill's quarters. Ramirez hasn't checked in for two weeks. Last transmission: timestamp discrepancy. "Minutes off. Through the gate? Should be instantaneous." Joe: "Two options. Compromised or turned." O'Neill: "Time discrepancy between Earth and Nova Roma. Casey's clocks don't match. And now Ramirez's timestamp doesn't match. I don't like coincidences."
**Who:** O'Neill, Joe.
**Timing:** 45 seconds.

### Beat 19: Test Visualization (Act 5)
**Use A-plot writer.** Casey builds a final demo. Spring, wave, color, statistics. The two clock readings scroll with sine-wave drift visible. Beautiful. Unsettling. Everything works. Everything is precise. And the ground shifts.
**Who:** Casey, full team observing.

### Beat 20: Tag — Joe/Casey at the Tavern
**Character writer, compressed.** Joe's claimed a corner of a tavern. Casey arrives. Brief exchange. "What made you stop watching?" "I came here." "Yeah. Me too."
**Who:** Joe, Casey.
**Timing:** 30 seconds.

### Beat 21A: Tag — Casey and Carter — The Evening Walk
**Use A-plot writer.** Carter finds Casey walking alone. "You built a clock that tells you what time does." Casey: "Midas. You said it's centered on Midas." Carter: "A man who warps time just by existing." Casey: "Next, we need to structure the data. XML." Carter: "Arbor documentorum. Tree of documents." The 1x09 tease.
**Who:** Casey, Carter.

### Beat 21B: Tag — Data and Casey — The Quiet Scene
**Use A-plot writer.** Workshop. Late. Data reviewing Tempus code. "Your code is elegant." Casey surprised. Data: "Captain Picard once showed me a watch. 'The measure of its elegance is the absence of anything unnecessary.'" Casey: "The math hasn't changed since 1971. Math doesn't deprecate." Data: "In the twenty-fourth century, the same easing curves are used." Two builders recognizing that things built from mathematics endure.
**Who:** Data, Casey.

### Beat 22: Stinger — Kirk's CHRONOGRAPHIA
**Compiled version (see Conflict 1 above).**
Gate telemetry sine wave. "The anomaly has a pulse." MIDAS — TEMPORAL PROFILE folder. "Biological?" Stopwatch vs. digital clock. 8/31. CHRONOGRAPHIA. "Time tells. It always tells." SMASH TO BLACK.
**Who:** Kirk alone.

- Casey/Carter evening walk with 1x09 tease (Beat 21A)
- Data/Casey quiet scene (Beat 21B)
- Kirk stinger framework (Beat 22)

**CUT:**
- Nothing major. This is the backbone.

### From the Character Writer:
**KEEP:**
- Three flashback eras (Taylor, IBM, Web3) — intercut structure
- The hand motif across eras
- "Huh. That's better." turning point (Beat 7)
- Casey/Carter collaboration as the episode's central relationship
- Casey teaching Marcus easing functions (folded into Beat 3)
- Casey/Joe mirror scene (Tag, Beat 20)
- "What do you count?" / "That I'm not in charge" (Beat F2)
- Marcus's horologium history — wrong for 100 years (Beat 18)
- Full ensemble beat table for direction reference
- The physical vocabulary notes for Casey across eras
- Midas's Herodotus sundial anecdote (Beat 3)

**CUT:**
- The full First Death flashback (1858 Manchester) — save for later Casey focus episode. Brief fragment only.
- Casey/Carter "11 microseconds" sync test scene — overlaps with the drift discovery and is less dramatic
- Casey teaching Marcus as a long scene (90 sec version) — fold into easing functions demonstration instead, shorter
- Three-voice Option B (Casey/Methos/Pliny) — save for later

### From the Threads Writer:
**KEEP:**
- Casey faith escalation: Roman apprentice, "Enough" (Beat F1)
- Beat C1: Earth-side "Smart Town" chyron (3 seconds, background)
- Beat C2: Carter's precise frequency analysis — "It's a heartbeat"
- Beat C3: Joe/Pliny working session — attribution debate
- Beat C4: O'Neill/Ramirez timestamp gap — "I don't like coincidences"
- The rosary-as-timepiece visual pairing throughout
- Faith escalation table (updated through 1x08)
- Thread status appendix — include at end of beat sheet
- Carter/Temporal frequency tracking table
- The nominalism progression through Casey's flashback (thematic notes)
- All backward/forward connection notes
- "Time Discrepancy" as new thread facet

**CUT:**
- Kirk stinger word TEMPUS (replaced with CHRONOGRAPHIA)
- Kirk's scheduling interface scene (replaced with A-plot writer's temporal surveillance)
- Teal'c independent temporal discovery near Midas (overlaps Carter C-plot)

### From the Genre Fan:
**KEEP:**
- Three-voice moment: Casey / Methos / Data (the trio and the speeches)
- The "Window of Opportunity" callback for Teal'c (Beat 10)
- The easing functions as autobiography / Casey's life as spring function — for thematic notes
- The wave function to character mapping table — for thematic notes
- The code-to-character map — for series bible / thematic notes
- The Annorax/Kirk parallel — for stinger direction notes
- Data's "Cause and Effect" parallel (Carter reading the temporal anomaly's poker hand) — thematic notes
- The franchise resonance analysis (Inner Light, Timescape, Window of Opportunity) — direction notes
- Kirk word: contribution to final stinger design
- O'Neill "Fifth Race" echo — NOT as dialogue. If used, make it even more implicit than 1x07's "That would have been useful." Perhaps O'Neill simply stays quiet during the clock-drift discovery while others react. Direction note only.

**CUT:**
- Kirk stinger word HOROLOGIUM (replaced with CHRONOGRAPHIA)
- The full genre analysis sections (1-10) — for series bible, not beat sheet
- The extended franchise-by-franchise breakdown — for series bible
- The easing function table mapping to franchises — fascinating but not dramatizable

### From the Historian:
**KEEP:**
- The Horologium Augusti — Marcus's knowledge of it, its failure, the political dimension. Give to Marcus in Beat 18.
- The variable Roman hour — "Time breathes." Marcus as the character who understands elastic time natively. Informs Beat 2 (delta time as variable hour).
- The clepsydra distinction (elapsed time vs. absolute time) — `tempus_elapsum` is a clepsydra, `tempus_nunc` is a sundial. For thematic notes.
- The Julian calendar reform as time synchronization — for Marcus's dialogue about "the priests broke time."
- The canonical hours — Casey's Catholic time structure. The monastery bell as the first standardized time signal. For thematic notes and the faith thread.
- Augustine on time: "If no one asks me, I know." — Possible Casey line or direction note. The gap between experiential knowledge and formal definition IS Casey's gap.
- Chronos vs. Kairos — the Tempus library encodes both. For thematic notes.
- The Latin vocabulary audit (tempus, horologium, hora, pulsus, quadrum, lenire, frequentia, unda) — all verified as correct classical Latin.
- Character knowledge map — Marcus knows sundials and broken Horologium, Pliny knows water clocks, Casey knows the full arc, Data IS a clock.
- Production design notes: sundials in the Forum, variable hour markings, Casey's mechanical watch.

**CUT:**
- The full medieval timekeeping section (monastery → town → mechanical clock) — for series bible, not beat sheet
- The railroad time section — historically fascinating but too detailed for the episode. Casey LIVED through it; the episode shouldn't lecture about it.
- The full liturgical calendar analysis — for series bible
- The detailed water clock construction (Ctesibius, Vitruvius) — save for production design reference
- The timeline check (79 AD context) — reference briefly in continuity notes

## F. ELEMENTS TO DEFER

### Defer to Later Episodes:
- **Casey's First Death (full flashback)** — Save for 1x15-16 (Casey teaches) or a later Casey bottle episode. Brief fragment only in 1x08.
- **Joe/Methos reunion** — Deferred from 1x07, due 1x09 or 1x10. Private. Late night. Wine.
- **Three-voice Option B (Casey/Methos/Pliny)** — "I would not trade my eighty years." Save for a later ensemble moment.
- **Teal'c's independent temporal investigation** — Would duplicate Carter's C-plot. Save for a later Teal'c-focused beat.
- **Casey teaching Marcus (extended scene, 90 sec)** — Seeds 1x15-16 teaching arc. Keep brief in 1x08, develop later.
- **Data as Greenwich Mean Time (reference standard)** — Historian's observation. Save for when clock synchronization becomes critical (1x15 networking?).

### Defer to Series Bible / Thematic Notes:
- The easing functions as autobiography (genre fan) — thematic notes
- The wave function to character mapping table (genre fan) — series bible
- Foundation Seldon parallel (genre fan) — series bible
- B5 Great Machine / Epsilon 3 parallel (genre fan) — series bible
- The full franchise-by-franchise analysis (genre fan) — series bible

## G. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

### 1. Casey's First Death — Fragment Only or Cut Entirely?

I've recommended a 5-10 second visual fragment of the cobbler era in the Cold Open (Casey's hands on keyboard → hands on leather → back). Is even this fragment too much for an already dense episode? Or does the visual rhyme justify 5 seconds?

**My recommendation:** Keep the fragment. It's 5 seconds. It tells the audience "there's more" without committing screen time. The full First Death should be saved for a later episode.

### 2. Casey's Flashback Order — Taylor → IBM → Web3 or IBM → Taylor → Web3?

I've placed Taylor in Act 2 (measurement resonance) and IBM in Act 3 (happiness-during-collaboration resonance). The character writer suggests the opposite — IBM first, then Taylor. Chronological order says Taylor → IBM → Web3.

**My recommendation:** Chronological (Taylor → IBM → Web3). The progression (disgust → contentment → despair) is the correct emotional shape. Taylor's walkout (disgust at measuring people) → IBM's warmth (happiness in honest craft) → Web3's emptiness (despair at meaninglessness) → Nova Roma's collaboration (rebirth). The shape is: low → high → lowest → new height. This is Casey's `elastrum_ad` function — overshoot, bounce, settle.

### 3. Three-Voice Placement — Late Act 4 or Tag?

I've placed the three-voice moment in late Act 4, growing from the utility functions scene (after Methos's "Remapping" line). The character writer recommends Act 4 or Tag. The genre fan doesn't specify.

**My recommendation:** Late Act 4, growing organically from Beat 15 (utility functions). This is where Methos first speaks, and the conversation naturally deepens. Placing it in the Tag would work but loses the momentum of the scene.

### 4. How Much Does Kirk Know About Midas?

The A-plot writer has Kirk writing "Biological?" — suggesting he suspects the temporal distortion is connected to a living being. The threads writer has Kirk hinting he knows about the temporal discrepancy generally but not about Midas specifically. The genre fan has Kirk as Annorax — studying time to exploit it.

**My recommendation:** AMBIGUOUS. Kirk writes "Biological?" with a question mark. He suspects. He doesn't know. He's analyzing the same data Carter is analyzing, from a different angle, and arriving at the same hypothesis independently. Whether he's ahead of Carter, behind Carter, or at the same place is deliberately unclear. The audience should be unsure what Kirk knows. This maximizes the stinger's tension.

### 5. Joe/Casey Tavern Scene — Tag or Cut?

The character writer's Joe/Casey mirror scene is excellent but the Tag already has two Casey scenes (Carter walk + Data workshop). Three Tag scenes may be too many.

**My recommendation:** Keep it, but BRIEF — 30 seconds. It's the emotional palette cleanser between the A-plot resolution and the quieter closing scenes. The rhythm: Joe/Casey (30 sec, warm) → Carter/Casey (60 sec, the Midas weight) → Data/Casey (60 sec, the craft appreciation) → Stinger (90 sec, Kirk). Four beats in descending intimacy, ending with the cold mirror.

**Fran to confirm or adjust.**
