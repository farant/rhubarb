# NOVUM FUNDAMENTUM — 1x08 "Horologium"
## GENRE FAN PITCH — Tempus (Time Management)

*Four coffees. A corkboard with red string. I started cross-referencing time episodes from SG-1, Trek, and Highlander at 2am and I haven't stopped because this episode is the ONE. Casey is building a clock. An IMMORTAL is building a CLOCK. Do you understand how hard every genre fan is going to lose their mind?*

## 1. CASEY = TIME PERSONIFIED — The Immortal Clockmaker

### The Core Irony That Powers the Whole Episode

Here is the single most important genre observation about 1x08:

**Casey has been alive for roughly 200 years. He has MORE TIME than any mortal in the room. And he is the one building the time library.**

That's not a coincidence. That's the show telling you something. The man who has personally EXPERIENCED time — not as an abstract concept but as a lived, crushing, beautiful biographical reality — is the one who understands it well enough to formalize it into code.

In SG-1, Carter builds things because she understands the physics. In Trek, Data builds things because he understands the specifications. In Highlander, Immortals don't build — they fight, they philosophize, they drink, they remember. They are CONSUMERS of time, not ARCHITECTS of it.

Casey breaks the mold. He's an Immortal who BUILDS. And in 1x08, he's building the one thing that defines his existence: a system for measuring, managing, and understanding time. The clock is a self-portrait.

### The Highlander Resonance: Immortals and Time

In Highlander, time is biographical. It's not a physics concept — it's something you LIVE THROUGH. When Duncan remembers 16th-century Scotland, he's not recalling a history lesson. He was THERE. The rain on the moor was real. The sword in his hand was real. Time, for an Immortal, is a stack of lived moments stretching back centuries.

Casey's flashback in 1x08 — the 160-year span from the 1850s to the 2010s — is the most HIGHLANDER thing this show has done. Because it's not a history lesson. It's one man's experience of watching the world change. The Industrial Revolution wasn't a chapter in a book. It was the decade Casey watched cobblers become factory workers. The IBM era wasn't a documentary. It was the years Casey respected the craft of computing before watching it dissolve into Web3 token slurry.

**Highlander "The Gathering" (S1E1) resonance:** The pilot established that Immortals carry their pasts PHYSICALLY — the flashback isn't memory, it's identity. When Duncan sees the cathedral under construction, he doesn't remember it. He RE-EXPERIENCES it. Casey's flashback structure in 1x08 should have the same weight: these aren't memories. These are the layers of sediment that MADE Casey who he is.

**Highlander "Methos" (S3E16-17) parallel:** When Methos was introduced, the genius was the GAP between what you expected (a warrior) and what you got (a grad student drinking beer). The five-thousand-year-old man was HIDING from history, not mastering it. Casey is the inverse: he didn't hide from time. He WATCHED it, LEARNED from it, and now he's building a system to MEASURE it. Methos runs from time. Casey runs INTO it.

### The Tempus Library as Character Study

Look at this code:

```c
f32 lenire_resiliens_egressus(f32 t)
```

`lenire_resiliens_egressus` — "softening, bouncing, on the way out." A bounce easing function. Time doesn't flow evenly. It bounces. It overshoots and settles. It's ELASTIC.

An Immortal knows this in their BONES. After a Quickening — after absorbing another Immortal's essence, their memories, their centuries — time doesn't settle smoothly. It BOUNCES. The new memories crash in, overshoot, settle, oscillate, settle again. `lenire_elasticus` isn't a math function for Casey. It's autobiography.

```c
f32 elastrum_ad(
    f32  currens,     /* current position */
    f32  destinatum,  /* target */
    f32* velocitas,   /* velocity — MUTABLE */
    f32  rigiditas,   /* stiffness */
    f32  damnum,      /* damping */
    f32  delta_tempus) /* time step */
```

Spring physics. The spring reaches toward the target, overshoots, bounces back, oscillates, settles. The damping determines how quickly it calms down.

**THE CASEY METAPHOR:** Casey's entire LIFE is a spring function. He reaches toward something (craft, purpose, community), overshoots (gets too invested, watches it collapse — IBM, Web3), bounces back (thirty years alone), oscillates (uncertainty, isolation), and then — Nova Roma. The destination he's approaching now. The `rigiditas` that pulls him is the craft. The `damnum` that calms him is the community. The `velocitas` — his momentum, mutable, changing — is his willingness to try again.

Casey building `elastrum_ad` is Casey FORMALIZING his own emotional mechanics into mathematics. The audience doesn't need to see this spelled out. The code IS the subtext.

## 2. TIME EPISODES ACROSS THE FRANCHISES — The Genre Architecture

### SG-1 "Window of Opportunity" (S4E6) — THE Time Loop Episode

Let me say this clearly: **"Window of Opportunity" is the most important SG-1 episode for understanding 1x08.**

Not because of the comedy (though the comedy is perfect — O'Neill golfing through the Stargate, Teal'c slamming the door in someone's face repeatedly). Because of what Teal'c DID with the loops.

Teal'c learned Latin. During the time loops, Teal'c — the Jaffa warrior who speaks in formal English and punctuates with "Indeed" — taught himself Latin. And in our show, Teal'c has been reading Latin code comments since 1x01 BECAUSE OF THIS. The time loops gave him a skill that made Nova Roma accessible. Time gave Teal'c a gift — and he's been quietly USING it for seven episodes.

**THE 1x08 CONNECTION:** When Casey builds the time library and the clocks don't synchronize — when Nova Roma's time is WARPED — Teal'c should feel a tremor of recognition. Not the full time-loop horror. But the awareness that time, on a fundamental level, is UNRELIABLE. Teal'c lived hundreds of loops where the universe reset every six hours. He knows what broken time feels like. When the clocks disagree on Nova Roma, Teal'c doesn't panic. He recognizes it. "I have experienced time that was not reliable. This is different. But the sensation is... familiar."

**The Maalox scene callback:** In "Window of Opportunity," there's a scene where O'Neill and Teal'c are the only ones who know the loops are happening, and O'Neill asks "What do you want to do?" And Teal'c's answer is to learn. He doesn't golf. He doesn't eat pie. He LEARNS. He teaches himself Latin because the loops gave him unlimited time and he chose to spend it on knowledge.

Casey has had 200 years of "unlimited time." And he spent it — not on pleasure, not on power — on CRAFT. On IBM tabulating machines. On understanding computing. On learning how things work. Casey and Teal'c are the same ARCHETYPE: the person who, given infinite time, chooses to learn.

### SG-1 "Unending" (S10E20) — Time as Prison

The team trapped in a time dilation field for DECADES. The ship is frozen. Inside, time passes normally. Outside, a fraction of a second. The crew ages. Teal'c ages VISIBLY — by the end, he's an old man. Carter and Daniel learn to play instruments. They have infinite time and a finite space. It's a prison.

**THE CASEY PARALLEL:** Casey's thirty years alone after the Web3 breaking point — that's "Unending." Not the science fiction version. The real version. A man trapped in time, watching the world move around him while he stands still. No time dilation field. Just immortality. The same prison.

The flashback should have an "Unending" FEELING to it: the same room, different decades. Casey in the same chair, watching technology change through a window while he stays the same. The Industrial Revolution through one window. IBM through the next. The internet through the next. Web3 through the last. And then he pushes back from the chair and walks away. Not because time stopped. Because it stopped MATTERING.

### SG-1 "1969" (S2E21) — Time as Displacement

The team thrown back to 1969. They have to navigate a world that isn't theirs. The culture shock of temporal displacement — being in a time you don't belong to.

Casey has been temporally displaced his ENTIRE LIFE. Every decade since the 1850s, he's been a man out of his time. Not literally — he ages forward. But his perspective is always OLDER than the world around him. He's a 19th-century craftsman watching the 21st century happen. The displacement isn't temporal. It's philosophical.

**1x08 RESONANCE:** On Nova Roma, for the first time, Casey is in a place where his perspective FITS. The Romans build things to last. The team builds libraries from scratch. Nobody is chasing platforms or funding rounds or tokenized governance. Casey is home — not because he's traveled through time, but because Nova Roma's VALUES match his century of origin.

### TNG "Cause and Effect" (S5E18) — Data's Poker Tell

The time loop. The Enterprise keeps exploding. Data encodes a message in his own positronic subprocessors — the number "3" — which manifests as him dealing all threes in a poker game. The crew recognizes the pattern and avoids the explosion.

**THE 1x08 PRINCIPLE:** Data persisted information ACROSS a time anomaly by encoding it in his own neural substrate. The temporal data survived because Data IS a persistence layer. And in 1x08, Carter is trying to ANALYZE temporal data — the frequency she detected in 1x07. She needs precise timestamps. She needs Casey's time library.

But here's the "Cause and Effect" deep cut: **Carter's periodic frequency IS Data's threes.** It's a signal embedded in the anomaly. Not random noise. A PATTERN. Carter is doing what Data did — finding the message hidden in the temporal distortion. Except Carter is doing it consciously, with instruments, while Data did it unconsciously, through poker.

The genre fans will see it: Carter is reading the temporal anomaly's poker hand. The threes are the frequency. The question is: who's dealing?

### TNG "Timescape" (S6E25) — Time at Different Speeds

Picard finds the Enterprise frozen in time. Different areas of the ship are running at different speeds. He can TOUCH the boundary between temporal zones. His fingernail ages years in seconds when he crosses a field.

**THE NOVA ROMA PROBLEM:** The clocks don't match. Time flows differently on Nova Roma than on Earth. This is "Timescape" at a civilizational scale — not a ship with temporal zones, but a WORLD where time itself is warped. And the warp isn't random (1x07 C-plot: it's periodic, structured, a frequency).

The `tempus_nunc()` function — "time now" — should become unreliable when measured against Earth reference clocks. Casey builds the time library and it WORKS. The functions are correct. The easing is precise. The frame management is tight. But the INPUT is wrong. The clock that feeds `fenestra_tempus_obtinere_pulsus()` is running at a different rate than it should be. The machine is counting correctly. The seconds themselves are the wrong length.

**THE GENRE MOMENT:** Casey runs two clocks. One on Nova Roma. One synchronized to Earth via the gate. They drift. Not randomly — periodically. Wave functions. And the tempus.c code already HAS wave functions:

```c
f32 unda_sinus(f32 t, f32 frequentia, f32 amplitudo)
```

Casey built the tool that DESCRIBES the anomaly before he knows the anomaly exists. The sine wave function he implemented for animation purposes turns out to be the mathematical shape of the temporal distortion. The tool and the problem are the same math.

### TNG "The Inner Light" (S5E25) — Time as Experience

Picard lives an entire lifetime in 25 minutes. The Kataan probe compressed decades into minutes. Time isn't objective. Time is EXPERIENCE.

**THE CASEY CONNECTION:** Casey has lived 200 years. But he didn't experience them evenly. The 1850s-1860s — his First Death, the Industrial Revolution — felt like a lifetime. The 30 years alone after Web3 felt like an eternity. The weeks on Nova Roma feel like DAYS because he's engaged, building, alive.

This is LITERALLY what easing functions describe:

```c
f32 lenire_quadraticus_ingressus(f32 t) { redde t * t; }
```

Quadratic ease-in. Time starts slow and accelerates. That's Casey's 200 years: the early decades are slow, vivid, each year distinct. The later decades blur together. Web3 collapses them to nothing. Nova Roma — the destination — hits like the end of a quadratic curve. Fast. Impactful. Everything happening at once.

```c
f32 lenire_sinus_ingressus_egressus(f32 t)
{
    redde -((f32)cos(M_PI * t) - 1.0f) / 2.0f;
}
```

Sine ease in-out. Slow start, fast middle, slow end. That's "The Inner Light." Picard's childhood (slow), his career (fast), his old age (slow). The probe didn't give Picard a LIFE. It gave him a `lenire_sinus_ingressus_egressus` — a shaped experience of time.

Casey should recognize this. Not explicitly. But when he codes the easing functions, there should be a beat — a pause, a look at his own hands — where the audience understands: Casey is encoding his own experience of two centuries into mathematical curves.

### DS9 "Trials and Tribble-ations" (S5E6) — Time as Homage

The DS9 crew goes back to TOS. They interact with Kirk's Enterprise. It's a love letter to the original show. Time travel as GENRE ARCHAEOLOGY — going back to the source material and honoring it.

**THE 1x08 CONNECTION:** Casey's flashback IS "Trials and Tribble-ations." Each era he visits — 1850s, early 1900s, 1950s, 2010s — is a love letter to a different era of technology. The Industrial Revolution as steampunk visual. The Taylorism lecture as period drama. IBM as mid-century Americana. Web3 as satirical dystopia. Each flashback segment is shot in the visual language of its era. The 1850s are sepia. The 1950s are Technicolor. The 2010s are the washed-out blue of a startup pitch deck.

And like "Trials and Tribble-ations," the joy is in the DETAILS. Casey noticing things that only someone who's been watching for 160 years would notice. The same tools in the 1850s workshop and the IBM lab, just scaled differently. The same human impulse toward craft, corrupted step by step into the abstraction of Web3.

### VOY "Year of Hell" (S4E8-9) — Annorax and the Time Weapon

Annorax's temporal weapon ship erases civilizations from history. Time as a weapon. Time as an instrument of control. The villain who treats time the way Kirk treats persistence — as a tool for power.

**THE KIRK STINGER CONNECTION:** If Kirk's stinger this episode involves time — and it should, because the dark mirror must reflect the A-plot — then Annorax is the template. Kirk doesn't have a time weapon. But he's tracking TIME DISCREPANCIES between Earth and Nova Roma. The C-plot mentions "time discrepancy between worlds." Kirk KNOWS that time flows differently near the gate. He's measuring it. He's using it.

Kirk as Annorax: the man who studies time not to understand it but to exploit it. Casey studies time to BUILD with it. Kirk studies time to WEAPONIZE the gap.

## 3. HOW TEMPUS.C FEATURES MAP TO GENRE MOMENTS

### The Easing Functions as Philosophical Metaphor

The easing library in tempus.c is TWENTY-ONE separate functions describing how values change over time. Not linearly. Not evenly. With SHAPE. Each one is a philosophy of change:

| Easing Function | Philosophy of Time | Genre Parallel |
|---|---|---|
| `lenire_linearis` | Time is constant and predictable | TOS — the optimistic future where time flows forward |
| `lenire_quadraticus_ingressus` | Slow start, accelerating | Casey's early immortal years → modern era (speeding up) |
| `lenire_exponens_egressus` | Fast start, decelerating | "Window of Opportunity" — each loop starts with urgency, ends in resigned routine |
| `lenire_retro_ingressus` | Pulls BACKWARD before going forward | Every Highlander flashback — you go back before you can go forward |
| `lenire_elasticus_ingressus_egressus` | Oscillates wildly before settling | The Quickening — time compresses, stretches, vibrates, settles |
| `lenire_resiliens_egressus` | Bounces at the destination | Casey on Nova Roma — he's arrived but he's not settled yet. Still bouncing. |
| `unda_sinus` | Smooth periodic oscillation | **Carter's temporal frequency** — the structured signal |
| `unda_triangulus` | Linear rise and fall | Marcus's engineering — steady, disciplined, no dramatics |
| `unda_dens_serrae` | Asymmetric sawtooth | Kirk's network — steady buildup, sharp drops (cells compromised, rebuilt) |
| `unda_quadratus` | Binary, on/off | The Borg — assimilated or not, no gradient |
| `unda_tumultus` | Pseudo-random noise | What Carter THOUGHT the temporal signal was before discovering it's periodic |

**THE GENRE ARCHITECTURE:** Each wave function maps to a character's relationship with time. Casey should be coding these and the audience should feel the resonance without it being stated. When Casey writes `unda_sinus` and Carter later uses it to analyze her temporal data — the tool the craftsman built and the scientist's instrument are the same function. The library IS the discovery.

### Frame Rate Management as Dramatic Metaphor

```c
vacuum tempus_exspectare_quadrum(vacuum)
```

"Wait for the frame." The function that controls pacing. It calculates how much time remains in the current frame, sleeps for most of it, then busy-waits for the final 2 milliseconds for precision.

**THE METAPHOR:** The frame rate is the pace of experience. Too fast and things blur. Too slow and everything stutters. The function doesn't just MEASURE time — it CONTROLS the pace at which experience unfolds.

Casey, the Immortal, has been living without frame rate management for 200 years. Every day at whatever speed life throws at him. No governor. No target. Just... time, flowing at whatever rate it flows. On Nova Roma, for the first time, he's building a system that GOVERNS the pace. He's not just measuring time. He's CHOOSING how fast things should happen.

The 60fps default (`quadra_destinata_per_secundum = 60.0`) is Casey choosing a pace for the first time in two centuries. Not too fast. Not too slow. Sixty moments per second. Enough to be smooth. Enough to be manageable. Enough to feel like life.

### The Global Clock vs. Independent Clocks

```c
/* Horologium globale */
hic_manens Tempus g_horologium;

/* Horologia independentia */
Tempus* tempus_creare(Piscina* piscina);
```

One global clock. Multiple independent clocks. The global clock is shared — everyone reads from the same source. The independent clocks are personal — each one tracks its own elapsed time, its own delta, its own frame.

**THE GENRE MAP:**
- **Global clock** = Nova Roma's shared time. The civilization's clock. Marcus's clock. The public square sundial.
- **Independent clocks** = Personal time. Casey's 200 years. Methos's 5000 years. Data's positronic experience (which doesn't map to biological time at all). Each person has their own `Tempus*`, allocated from their own `Piscina*`, measuring their own experience.

And the clocks DON'T AGREE. That's the A-plot. The global clock says one thing. Earth's clock says another. The discrepancy is the Midas temporal anomaly made measurable. The easing functions describe the shape of the discrepancy. The wave functions describe its periodicity. Casey built every tool needed to DESCRIBE the anomaly. Carter uses those tools to PROVE the anomaly is real.

---

## 4. THE THREE-VOICE ALGORITHM MOMENT — Time as Experience

### The Pattern Continues

| Episode | Three Voices | Algorithm | Lens |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------|
| 1x05 | Pliny / Data / Casey | Hashing | Fingerprint of knowledge |
| 1x06 | Methos / Data / Casey | Interning | Canonical copy, one for all |
| 1x07 | Joe / Pliny / Data | Persistence | Writing to survive |
| **1x08** | **Casey / Methos / Data** | **Time management** | **Time as lived vs. measured vs. computed** |

Casey MUST be in the three-voice. This is HIS episode. His library. His flashback. And the three-voice should reflect three fundamentally different relationships with time:

**CASEY:** *(looking at the easing functions on screen, the curves he coded that morning)* "Time isn't constant. I've been alive for —" *(a beat — he doesn't say the number in public)* "— a long time. And I can tell you that years aren't equal. Some years take a decade to live through. Some decades pass in an afternoon. The easing functions aren't abstractions. They're what time ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE." *(pointing at the screen)* "That one — `lenire_retro_ingressus` — pulls backward before moving forward. That's memory. Every time you remember something vividly, time pulls you backward before it lets you go forward. The math is right because the experience is right."

**METHOS:** *(wine, pillar, five thousand years of perspective)* "Five thousand years. You'd think that's a lot. It isn't. Most of it is WAITING. Waiting for something to matter. Waiting for something to last. Waiting for something you built to survive a century." *(beat)* "Time isn't long or short. It's dense or sparse. A decade where nothing happens is a single point. A single day where everything changes is infinite. Your functions —" *(gestures at the screen)* "— the ones that slow down and speed up — those are the ones that are true. The constant one? `lenire_linearis`? That one is a lie. Time has never been linear. Time has never been FAIR."

**DATA:** *(precise, curious, processing something he doesn't quite have the emotional vocabulary for)* "My internal chronometer records time at nanosecond precision. Each second is identical to the last. There is no acceleration, no deceleration, no elastic behavior. My experience of time is `lenire_linearis` — perfectly constant." *(a beat that is longer than Data's usual beats)* "And yet. When I am engaged in conversation with Midas, or solving a problem with Carter, or listening to Joe play his guitar — I become aware that my subjective experience does not match my chronometer. The seconds are identical. Something is not." *(quieter)* "I believe the easing functions describe something my chronometer cannot measure. Something that exists between the ticks."

Three translations:
- **Casey:** Time as BIOGRAPHICAL EXPERIENCE — the Immortal who has lived it, felt it warp, felt decades compress and expand. The easing functions are autobiography.
- **Methos:** Time as EXISTENTIAL DENSITY — the oldest man alive, for whom time is measured not in years but in events that mattered. Most time is empty. Some time is infinite.
- **Data:** Time as the GAP BETWEEN MEASUREMENT AND EXPERIENCE — the android who measures perfectly and still suspects there's something his instruments miss. The easing functions describe what his chronometer can't.

**THE ARCHITECTURE:** Casey speaks from the body. Methos speaks from the abyss. Data speaks from the gap between his measurements and his experience. All three are right. All three describe something the other two miss. The algorithm moment becomes the thesis: time management isn't about precision. It's about understanding that time has SHAPE.

## 5. KIRK'S STINGER — The Genre Fan's Version

### The Progression Updated

| Episode | Kirk Word | Count | Dark Library |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1x04 | — | 3/31 | Dark Xar |
| 1x05 | TABULARIUM | 5/31 | Dark Tabula Dispersa |
| 1x06 | LEXICON | 6/31 | Dark Internamentum |
| 1x07 | ARCHIVUM | 7/31 | Dark Filum |
| **1x08** | **HOROLOGIUM** | **8/31** | **Dark Tempus** |

### Kirk and Time

**Location:** Earth. Night. Kirk's office at Synthesis Dynamics. He's studying something on a monitor. Two windows open: one showing a data stream from Nova Roma (intercepted gate telemetry), the other showing a standard Earth clock.

The numbers don't match.

Kirk has noticed the time discrepancy. Not the temporal anomaly — he doesn't know about Midas. But the MEASURABLE fact that signals from Nova Roma arrive at intervals that don't correspond to Earth seconds. A message sent at what should be a five-second interval arrives at 4.7 seconds. Or 5.3. Inconsistent. Periodic.

**KIRK:** *(to his aide)* "Pull the gate telemetry for the last thirty days. Every signal. Every handshake. Log the timestamps."

**AIDE:** "What are we looking for?"

**KIRK:** "A clock. Their clock. And how it differs from ours."

Kirk isn't just tracking Nova Roma's operations. He's tracking Nova Roma's TIME. He's building his own temporal analysis — a dark mirror of Casey's horologium. The same math. The same curiosity. Different purpose.

He writes on his whiteboard: **8 / 31**

Below the previous words — TABULARIUM, LEXICON, ARCHIVUM — a new one:

**HOROLOGIUM**

**KIRK:** *(looking at the timestamp discrepancy on screen)* "Time should be the one thing that's the same everywhere."

He closes the laptop. But the timestamp log is still running. Kirk's `filum_scriptor` is open, mode `FILUM_MODUS_APPENDERE`. Every gate signal, timestamped. Every discrepancy, logged. The file grows.

**THE GENRE FAN'S READING:** Kirk's log-captain's-log instinct from TOS meets the Borg's analytical precision. TOS Kirk documented for accountability. Our Kirk documents for pattern recognition. He's found an anomaly that nobody else is tracking from the OUTSIDE. Carter is tracking it from the inside. Kirk is tracking it from the outside. They're converging on the same truth from opposite ends.

And the Annorax echo: a villain studying time. Not to understand it. To USE it.

SMASH TO BLACK.

## 6. EASTER EGGS AND DEEP CUTS BY FANDOM

### SG-1

- **"Window of Opportunity" callback:** When the clocks disagree, Teal'c should pause. One beat. Then: "I have... experience with unreliable time." O'Neill: "Don't remind me." The fans who know will SCREAM. O'Neill and Teal'c's shared trauma — the loops — surfacing in a single exchange.
- **"The Fifth Race" echo:** When Casey demonstrates `tempus_nunc()` and gets a precise measurement of "now," O'Neill should react. Subtly. Because O'Neill once had the Ancients' knowledge of time and space in his head, and "knowing what time it is" was part of it. The knowledge he lost. The measurement he can't make anymore.
- **"2010" / "2001" resonance:** The Aschen manipulated time — extended human lifespans, controlled population growth. Time as a weapon of slow conquest. Kirk studying Nova Roma's time discrepancy echoes the Aschen studying Earth's biology. Both are patient predators analyzing their prey's clock.
- **Carter's notebook:** She writes wave function parameters from the temporal data. The page after "TABULAE CERATAE" from 1x07. The page after "CANONICA" from 1x06. Her notebook is the episode index, and the audience tracking it has a cheat sheet for the season's mysteries.

### Star Trek

- **"Cause and Effect" echo:** Data running two processes — one measuring Nova Roma time, one measuring Earth reference time — and finding they diverge. Data doesn't lose his composure, but he runs the measurement FOUR TIMES. Data repeating a measurement is Data's version of panic.
- **"Timescape" visual:** If the temporal distortion is VISIBLE in any way — a shimmer, a ripple, a moment where something moves too slow or too fast — it should look like the Timescape fields. Areas where time runs at a slightly different rate. Not dramatic. Not science fiction. Just... wrong. A candle flame that flickers too slowly. A water drop that falls too fast.
- **"The Inner Light" resonance for Data:** Data carries Picard's Katan memories. He KNOWS what it's like to have decades of experience compressed into minutes. When Casey describes time as non-linear, Data has a reference point that isn't his own experience — it's Picard's experience, stored in his memory banks. "I carry the memories of a man who lived a lifetime in twenty-five minutes. He would agree with you."
- **"All Good Things" seed:** The temporal anomaly growing BACKWARD — Q's test from the TNG finale. Carter's periodic frequency could be something that exists across time, not just in the present. This is a seed, not a revelation. But the freeze-frame viewers will wonder.
- **TOS "The Naked Time" callback:** The episode where the Enterprise has to cold-start the engines, mixing matter and antimatter, and Scotty says "I cannae change the laws of physics!" But then the time travel happens. Time was already breaking the rules in TOS's first season. The franchise has always known time is unreliable.

### Highlander

- **The Quickening as temporal event:** When an Immortal takes a Quickening, time COMPRESSES. Lightning, shockwave, the absorption of centuries of memory in seconds. The `lenire_elasticus` function — the oscillating, overshooting, eventually-settling easing curve — IS a Quickening described mathematically. Casey knows this. He's felt it.
- **"Comes a Horseman" (S6E8-9) temporal weight:** The Methos/Horsemen flashbacks cover 3000 years in minutes of screen time. Methos's three-voice moment — "Five thousand years. Most of it is WAITING" — echoes the Horsemen reveal. When Methos was Death, time was filled. When Methos was hiding, time was empty. The density of experience, not the length.
- **Joe's Watcher Chronicle timestamps:** Joe writes dates. Every entry has a date. He's been timestamping Immortal history for 30 years. When Casey demonstrates `tempus_nunc()`, Joe should nod. "Timestamps. That's half the job." Because for a Watcher, WHEN something happened is as important as WHAT happened. Joe already understands tempus. He's been doing it by hand.
- **Duncan's sense of Casey:** Duncan has known Casey for some duration (the show should establish this). He's seen Casey outlast institutions, technologies, civilizations. Duncan, who watches things END, now watches Casey build something new. The genre fan reads it: Duncan sees in Casey what he wishes he could be — an Immortal who builds instead of fights.
- **"The Gathering" fragment:** Casey's First Death in the 1850s-60s should FEEL like a Highlander cold open. The shock of dying and not dying. The first Quickening-flash of impossibility. Shot with Highlander visual grammar — the gasping return, the confusion, the dawning horror/wonder. Then SMASH to the Industrial Revolution. He's alive. He can't die. And the world around him is about to change completely.

### Foundation

- **Hari Seldon's clock:** Seldon predicted the future by MODELING time. His psychohistory was a temporal prediction engine — a `tempus_nunc()` for civilizations. Casey's time library is the micro version: measuring seconds. Seldon's was the macro version: measuring centuries. Same impulse. Different scale. The show is building from the ground up what Seldon tried to build from the top down.

### Babylon 5

- **"The Deconstruction of Falling Stars" (S4E22):** A million years of future history in one episode. Each scene separated by centuries. Time as a stack of eras, each one commenting on the last. Casey's flashback has the same structure: eras stacked vertically, each one commenting on what came before.
- **Sinclair in the past, Sheridan in the future:** B5's two commanders existed at BOTH ends of time. Sinclair became Valen and went back 1000 years. Sheridan went forward to Z'ha'dum and came back with a 20-year clock on his life. Casey exists at BOTH ends too — his past stretches 200 years back, his present is on a world where time itself is warped.

## 7. THE EASING FUNCTIONS AS PHILOSOPHICAL METAPHOR — The Genre Fan's Full Treatment

### Time Is Not Linear (And Every Franchise Knows It)

The fundamental insight of the easing library is that CHANGE IS SHAPED. Values don't move from A to B in a straight line. They ease in, ease out, bounce, overshoot, oscillate, snap. The twenty-one easing functions in tempus.c are twenty-one philosophies of how things change.

**THE NOMINALISM THREAD:** Linear time — `lenire_linearis`, the straight line from 0 to 1 — is the nominalist position on time. Time is a neutral container. Events fill it arbitrarily. One second is like any other second. Time has no NATURE — it's just the measurement of interval.

The easing functions are the REALIST position: time has shape. Some moments are heavier than others. Acceleration exists. Deceleration exists. Some transitions bounce and some transitions snap and the SHAPE tells you something about the NATURE of the change. Time isn't a neutral container. Time IS the experience.

Casey, the realist, builds twenty-one functions that describe shaped time. A nominalist would build one: `lenire_linearis`. "Time is time. Why would you need twenty other versions?" Casey knows why. He's LIVED twenty other versions.

**THE METHOS COROLLARY:** "The constant one? `lenire_linearis`? That one is a lie." Five thousand years have taught Methos that time is never fair, never even, never constant. The easing functions VALIDATE his experience. The code agrees with him. Time has shape. The straight line is the exception, not the rule.

**THE DATA PARADOX:** Data's chronometer IS `lenire_linearis`. His internal clock ticks at perfectly constant intervals. And yet he suspects something is missing. The gap between his measurement (linear) and his experience (shaped) is the android's version of the nominalism/realism debate. His instruments say time is uniform. His experience says time has texture. Which one is true?

### The Bounce and the Spring — Time After Trauma

```c
f32 lenire_resiliens_egressus(f32 t)
{
    /* Bounces multiple times before settling at destination */
}
```

Bounce easing. The value hits the target and BOUNCES. Multiple times. Each bounce smaller. Eventually it settles.

**THE GENRE READING:** This is time after trauma. After a Quickening. After a time loop breaks. After you lose a library, a friend, a civilization. Time doesn't just stop and resume. It BOUNCES. You think you've arrived at the new normal and then it kicks you back. You settle. You bounce again. Smaller. You settle. Eventually the bounces are too small to notice. But they never fully stop.

Casey after his First Death: bouncing. Casey after IBM: bouncing. Casey after Web3: the bounce that never settled, thirty years of oscillation with no damping. Until Nova Roma.

```c
f32 elastrum_ad(currens, destinatum, velocitas, rigiditas, damnum, delta_tempus)
```

The spring function. Casey is the `currens` (current position). Nova Roma is the `destinatum` (destination). His `velocitas` (velocity) is mutable — it changes as he approaches. The `rigiditas` (stiffness) is the craft itself, pulling him toward something real. The `damnum` (damping) is the community — the thing that prevents him from overshooting and bouncing forever.

Nova Roma is the first place in 200 years that provides enough DAMPING for Casey to settle. That's the emotional arc of 1x08, encoded in a spring physics function.

## 8. WAVE FUNCTIONS AND CARTER'S TEMPORAL SIGNAL — The Discovery

### The Connection That Pays Off

In 1x07, Carter saved her temporal data to disk and discovered a periodic frequency. The oscillation isn't random — it's structured. A SIGNAL, not noise.

In 1x08, Casey builds wave functions:

```c
f32 unda_sinus(f32 t, f32 frequentia, f32 amplitudo);
f32 unda_triangulus(f32 t, f32 frequentia, f32 amplitudo);
f32 unda_dens_serrae(f32 t, f32 frequentia, f32 amplitudo);
f32 unda_quadratus(f32 t, f32 frequentia, f32 amplitudo);
```

Carter takes Casey's wave functions — built for animation, for UI, for game loops — and uses them to ANALYZE the temporal anomaly. She fits her data to a sine wave. It's not a perfect fit. She tries a triangle wave. Closer. She tries a superposition of waves. Closer still.

The temporal signal has a waveform. It has a frequency. It has an amplitude. And it's coming from MIDAS.

**THE GENRE ARCHITECTURE:** Casey builds a tool. Carter uses the tool. The tool reveals something about Midas. The library IS the episode IS the discovery IS the mystery. The A-plot (building tempus), the B-plot (Casey's flashback), and the C-plot (the temporal anomaly) are THREE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SAME THING: time has shape, and if you measure it carefully enough, the shape tells you something true.

### The Noise Function as Thematic Counterpoint

```c
f32 unda_tumultus(f32 t)
{
    /* Pseudo-random noise based on time */
    s32 semen = (s32)(t * 12345.6789);
    semen = (semen * 1103515245 + 12345) & 0x7fffffff;
    redde ((f32)semen / (f32)0x7fffffff) * 2.0f - 1.0f;
}
```

`unda_tumultus` — "wave of tumult/noise." Pseudo-random, chaotic, unpredictable. This is what Carter THOUGHT the temporal anomaly was before 1x07. Random noise. Tumult. Now she knows it's not `unda_tumultus` — it's `unda_sinus`. The noise was always a signal. She just didn't have the tools to see it until Casey built them.

**The genre reading:** Every great mystery show has the moment where noise becomes signal. X-Files: "The truth is out there" — the pattern in the chaos. B5: "We are grey" — the order hidden in the ambiguity. BSG: "All of this has happened before" — the cycle disguised as randomness.

Carter's transition from `unda_tumultus` to `unda_sinus` IS the show's epistemological thesis: there is structure in reality. You just have to build the right instruments to see it. The realist position: truth has shape, and the shape is discoverable.

## 9. CASEY'S FLASHBACK — THE GENRE FAN'S BREAKDOWN

### Each Era as a Genre Homage

The season outline gives us four flashback eras. Here's how the genre fan reads each one:

**1850s-60s: First Death + Industrial Revolution**
- **Genre language:** Shot like a Highlander cold open. The gasping return. The confusion. The physical shock. Then transition to wide shots of smokestacks, factories, the new world. This is the Highlander S1 visual vocabulary — amber light, period costumes, the weight of history.
- **Time connection:** Casey's first experience of time as something DIFFERENT. Before his First Death, time was mortal — linear, finite, running out. After: infinite. `lenire_linearis` becomes `lenire_exponens_ingressus` — the flat line becomes the exponential curve. Everything changes.
- **"A cobbler makes shoes. A factory worker operates a machine."** This is the first nominalist step. People WERE their craft. Now they OPERATE machines. Identity separated from function. The cobbler IS a cobbler. The factory worker DOES factory work. The ontological demotion begins.

**Early 1900s: Taylorism Lecture**
- **Genre language:** Shot like a noir training film. Industrial. Clinical. Men with clipboards timing men with hammers. Casey in the audience, disgusted but fascinated.
- **Time connection:** Taylorism is TIME MANAGEMENT applied to human beings. Measuring efficiency in seconds. Optimizing movements. Treating workers as `tempus_quadrum` — frames in a loop to be optimized. Casey is watching someone build a human `tempus_exspectare_quadrum` — forcing workers into a target frame rate. He walks out.
- **The genre parallel:** This is "Year of Hell" Annorax logic applied to factory floors. Temporal control as domination. Not a time weapon. A STOPWATCH weapon. Casey recognizes it for what it is: time as a tool of power rather than a tool of craft.

**1950s-70s: IBM**
- **Genre language:** Shot like "Hidden Figures" meets "Halt and Catch Fire." Warm. Respectful. The click of keypunches. The hum of mainframes. Casey in his element.
- **Time connection:** Computing is BORN as a time machine. The first computers were built to calculate trajectories — predicting where a shell would be at a future TIME. IBM's machines compute AHEAD of time. They predict. Casey sees this and respects it: technology that extends human ability rather than replacing human nature.
- **"The craft is real."** This is Casey's REALIST era. IBM's engineers are craftsmen. They build things. The machines have natures — they ARE something specific, with specific capabilities, specific limitations. This is the era Casey loves because the nominalism hasn't won yet. Things still have identities.

**2010s: Web3 Breaking Point**
- **Genre language:** Shot like Silicon Valley meets Black Mirror. Blue-tinted. Sterile. A pitch deck on a screen. Buzzwords. Casey's face.
- **Time connection:** Web3 is TIME made meaningless. "Decentralized governance for... something." Nothing has duration. Nothing persists. Everything is a pivot. The startup has existed for eleven months and has already pivoted three times. Time is just burn rate.
- **`unda_tumultus`** — pure noise. No signal. No frequency. No structure. Web3 is the `unda_tumultus` of civilization. Casey finally sees it: the nominalist progression he's been watching for 160 years has reached its endpoint. When NOTHING has a nature, NOTHING is worth building. He walks away.

### The Flashback's Genre Architecture

The four eras map to four easing functions:

| Era | Easing Function | Time Experience |
|---|---|---|
| 1850s-60s | `lenire_exponens_ingressus` | Sudden shift. Everything changes at once. |
| Early 1900s | `lenire_quadraticus_ingressus` | Slow build of dread. The acceleration of dehumanization. |
| 1950s-70s | `lenire_sinus_ingressus_egressus` | Rise and fall. The golden era that peaks and declines. |
| 2010s | `unda_tumultus` | Noise. No pattern. The collapse of meaning. |

And then Nova Roma:

| Nova Roma | `elastrum_ad` | Spring toward destination. Bouncing. Settling. Home. |

The flashback isn't just backstory. It's a WAVEFORM. Casey's life is a complex wave function — the superposition of all these eras. And Nova Roma is the point where the wave settles into coherence.

## 10. STRUCTURAL GENRE OBSERVATIONS

### The Episode's Place in the Season Architecture

1x01-1x03: Foundation (the primitives — memory, testing, strings)
1x04-1x06: Organization (collection, indexing, canonicalization)
1x07: Persistence (writing to survive)
**1x08: Measurement (knowing when)**

This is the classical progression of a recording system:
- Learn to STORE (1x01-1x06)
- Learn to SAVE (1x07)
- **Learn to TIMESTAMP (1x08)**

A record without a timestamp is evidence without a witness. File I/O says WHAT. Tempus says WHEN. The record becomes forensic. The data becomes history.

**Foundation parallel:** Seldon didn't just write the Encyclopedia. He DATED his predictions. Each holographic appearance was timestamped to the crisis it addressed. The timestamp is what made the predictions ACTIONABLE. Without "when," the predictions are philosophy. With "when," they're prophecy.

**B5 parallel:** The Great Machine on Epsilon 3 doesn't just record — it timestamps. When Draal accesses historical records, he can navigate to specific MOMENTS. The timestamp is the index. Without it, the archive is a pile. With it, the archive is searchable. Nova Roma just learned to SAVE in 1x07. In 1x08, they learn to save WITH DATES. The archive becomes navigable.

### The First Casey-Centric Episode

This is the first episode where Casey drives both the A-plot AND the B-plot. Previous Casey moments were supporting beats — the IBM flashback in 1x03, the rosary moments, the faith thread. In 1x08, Casey is the PROTAGONIST.

**Genre precedent:** In SG-1, Teal'c-centric episodes (Threshold, Changeling) are where the show goes DEEPEST. Because Teal'c is the character who carries the most internal weight — the most history, the most conflict between his past and his present. Casey is the show's Teal'c: the character who has seen the most, lost the most, and says the least about it.

A Casey-centric episode should feel like "Threshold" — patient, layered, with flashbacks that recontextualize everything you thought you knew about the character. Not action-driven. MEMORY-driven.

### The Casey/Carter Convergence

Casey builds the time library. Carter uses it to analyze the temporal anomaly. Their paths CROSS in 1x08 in a way they haven't before.

**The SG-1 Sam/Teal'c dynamic:** In SG-1, Carter and Teal'c rarely had extended one-on-one scenes. But when they did ("Tangent," "Chimera"), the pairing worked because they're COMPLEMENTARY — Carter is theory, Teal'c is practice. Carter understands the physics. Teal'c has lived the experience.

Casey and Carter are the same pairing. Carter understands temporal physics. Casey has LIVED time at a scale Carter can only theorize about. When Carter shows Casey the periodic frequency — the sine wave in the temporal data — Casey doesn't need a physics explanation. He RECOGNIZES it. "That's not noise. That's a heartbeat." Because Casey has been alive long enough to know what periodic patterns feel like. Seasons. Decades. Centuries. The oscillation of history. He's been listening to time's heartbeat for 200 years.

**Carter's response:** The scientist seeing the craftsman's intuition confirmed by the math. "How did you know it was periodic?" Casey: "Everything natural is periodic. Tides. Seasons. Heartbeats. If it's periodic, it's ALIVE." The realist position: periodicity implies nature. If the signal has a frequency, it has a source. If it has a source, it can be found.

*[Sets down fourth coffee. The corkboard has run out of space. There is a timeline of every time-related episode across SG-1, TNG, DS9, VOY, and Highlander pinned to the wall. Red string connects "Window of Opportunity" to Teal'c's Latin, which connects to Nova Roma's code comments, which connects to Casey's tempus library, which connects to Carter's frequency, which connects to Midas. The string forms a sine wave. I am not apologizing.]*

*Casey is an Immortal building a clock. The easing functions are autobiography. The wave functions are the shape of the mystery. The three-voice moment is three beings who have each lived time differently arriving at the same truth: time has shape, and the shape is what matters.*

*The clocks disagree. The signal is periodic. Casey's spring function is finally settling.*

*Horologium.*
