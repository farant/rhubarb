### CHARACTER & FLASHBACK PITCH

## 1. METHOS — THE ALEXANDRIA REVELATION

### The Trigger

The scene happens in Act Two or early Act Three. The team is building the internamentum — the string interning system. Daniel and Lucia are explaining canonical forms to the team. Lucia: "Every word in a dictionary has one entry. One spelling. One canonical form. When you encounter the word in a text, you do not create a new word — you refer to the existing one."

Daniel, excited, takes it further: "The Library of Alexandria tried to do this. They didn't just collect scrolls — they collected the *definitive* scrolls. If two copies of Euclid disagreed, they chose one. They established the canonical text."

And then Methos, who has been drinking wine and half-listening, says:

**METHOS:** "They didn't just choose. They *destroyed* the variants. The Ptolemies confiscated every scroll that entered the harbor. Copied the ones they wanted. Returned the copies and kept the originals. The canonical text wasn't preserved — it was *seized*."

The room goes quiet. Methos has been speaking in the wrong tense. Not "The Ptolemies reportedly..." Not "According to ancient sources..." He said "They." As if he was there. As if he watched it happen.

Daniel, the archaeologist whose whole career is built on fragments and inference, catches it instantly. His head comes up like a dog on point.

**DANIEL:** "You said 'they.' Not 'the Ptolemies.' Not 'the librarians.' *They.*"

**METHOS:** *(realizing his mistake, already reaching for deflection)* "I've read a lot about it."

**DANIEL:** "You weren't reading. You were *remembering.*"

Long beat. Methos holds the wine cup very still. He's been doing this for five thousand years — lying by omission, deflecting with humor, hiding behind "I read about it somewhere." But Daniel Jackson isn't a casual historian. Daniel Jackson decoded the Stargate. Daniel Jackson's entire career is identifying when a text is primary source versus secondary. And Methos just spoke like a primary source.

**METHOS:** *(the mask slipping — and the audience sees it, Peter Wingfield's whole face changing)* "I was... in Alexandria. For a time."

**DANIEL:** "You were THERE?"

**METHOS:** "I was there for a lot of things, Daniel. It was a big library. I was a small man with a wine habit. I shelved things."

He's trying to make it small. Mundane. A 5,000-year-old doing clerical work. But the deflection is too fast, too practiced, and Daniel can smell it.

**DANIEL:** "Which fire? There were several. Caesar's? The Christian mob? The Arab conquest?"

**METHOS:** *(quiet)* "The first one. Caesar's. I was there for Caesar's."

### The Crack

And then it comes out — not because Methos wants to tell it, but because the interning discussion has opened something. The concept of *canonical copies* — one true version that serves all references — touches something Methos has been carrying.

**METHOS:** "The Library wasn't just scrolls. There were sub-chambers. Lower levels that the scholars didn't access. The librarians had their collection — philosophy, mathematics, literature. But below that..." *(he drinks)* "There were older collections. Things that predated the Ptolemies. Things that predated Egypt."

**DANIEL:** "What kind of things?"

**METHOS:** "Cults. Alexandria was a crossroads — you had every mystery religion in the ancient world within a mile of each other. Isis. Mithras. Dionysus. And older ones. Ones that didn't have names anymore." *(beat)* "There was a priestess. She guarded a sub-chamber. I tried to catalog what was in there once. She told me the contents weren't meant to be cataloged."

**DANIEL:** "What was in the sub-chamber?"

**METHOS:** "Artifacts. Tablets. And a stone. Black. Dense. Warm to the touch even in winter." *(he stops)* "The priestess said it spoke to people. Not in words — in... patterns. People who spent time near it started thinking the same way. Finishing each other's sentences. Moving in unison. They called it communion. I called it something else."

**DANIEL:** "What did you call it?"

**METHOS:** *(long pause, the humor completely gone)* "Assimilation."

He catches himself. Sets down the wine cup. Changes the subject with visible effort.

**METHOS:** "The point is that canonical copies are a good idea. The Library proved it. Your interning system is sound. Shall we get back to work?"

Daniel doesn't push. But he doesn't let go either. He writes something in his notebook and shows it to no one. The archaeologist has filed this. He will come back to it.

### What the Audience Sees

Methos's armor, which has been airtight for five episodes, cracks for thirty seconds. Beneath the wine and the sardonic commentary, there is a man who watched the first great archive of human knowledge burn and who recognized — 2,300 years before the Borg had a name — the pattern of assimilation in an ancient cult.

This is not the full Methos story. That's 1x17, "Quinque Milia Annorum." This is the FIRST CRACK. The audience gets a glimpse through the keyhole. Enough to realize Methos isn't just old — he's *haunted*. And what haunts him isn't the Library burning. It's what was *under* the Library.

### The Performance Note

Think Peter Wingfield in the Highlander episode "Comes a Horseman" — the moment when Duncan discovers Methos was one of the Four Horsemen. The humor drops. The eyes go flat. Five thousand years of horror surface for a single beat, and then the mask goes back on. That's the register we need. Except here, the horror isn't what Methos *did* — it's what he *saw*. He saw assimilation working before it had a name. He saw it in the ecstatic rites around a black stone. And he's been running from that knowledge for two and a half millennia.

## 2. THE METHOS FLASH — NOT A FULL FLASHBACK

No full flashback for Methos in this episode. That's 1x17. But there SHOULD be a flash — a 10-15 second sensory hit during the revelation scene.

When Methos says "a stone, black, dense, warm to the touch" — the image HITS:

**FLASH:** A torchlit sub-chamber. Stone walls. A woman's face — Ptolemaic Egyptian, kohled eyes, half-shadow. Behind her: a pedestal. On the pedestal: a stone. Black. It absorbs the torchlight rather than reflecting it. The woman is chanting. Not loudly — under her breath. A rhythm. And behind her, in the deeper shadows, figures moving in unison. Not dancing. *Synchronized.* Their movements identical, their eyes unfocused.

Young Methos — and the audience should barely recognize him, because this Methos doesn't have the sardonic mask yet, this is a younger face, more open, more frightened — watching from behind a column. He backs away. The stone seems to pulse once. The chanting stops. The priestess turns toward him.

**SMASH CUT BACK TO:** Present-day Methos, wine cup in hand, eyes distant. The flash is over. Fifteen seconds.

The visual establishes:
- The stone exists
- It was in Alexandria
- It produced synchronized behavior (proto-Borg)
- Methos was afraid of it
- The priestess guarded it deliberately

This pays off the 3-second Methos reaction in 1x05 (when the compass spun near Midas). NOW the audience knows why he reacted. He's seen this before. He's seen what proximity to a black stone does to people. And Midas — their friend Midas — is producing the same temporal signature.

---

## 3. DATA AND MIDAS — THE DEEPENING FRIENDSHIP

### The Scene: Walking the Colony

Data and Midas have been increasingly paired since 1x04 (the census — Data classified as "peregrinus amicus" on Midas's suggestion). In 1x05 they bonded in the background during the encyclopedia work. Now, in 1x06, they have a *scene*.

They're walking the colony together. Something they've apparently started doing — a routine the audience hasn't seen before but immediately understands has been happening off-screen. Data walks precisely. Midas ambles. Data observes; Midas narrates.

**MIDAS:** "See that garden? Tertia Valeria planted it. She says the soil here reminds her of Phrygia. I told her Phrygia was nothing like this. She told me I don't remember Phrygia as well as I think." *(laughs)* "She's probably right. Three thousand years is a long time to remember dirt."

**DATA:** "Do you remember Phrygia?"

**MIDAS:** *(walking slower)* "Pieces. I remember the mountain. I remember the temple. I remember..." *(he touches the back of his neck, unconsciously, where the temporal effect sometimes manifests as warmth)* "I remember being different afterward."

**DATA:** "Different how?"

**MIDAS:** "Before I touched the stone, I could hold a cup without it changing. After, everything I touched... shifted. Not gold — that's the story they told later. The world around me became... unreliable. Time moved differently near me. Plants grew faster. Metal aged."

### The Interning Parallel

They arrive at the workshop where Carter is explaining the internamentum concept.

**CARTER:** "When you intern a string, you check: does this exact string already exist in the system? If yes, you point to the existing copy. If no, you create a new canonical copy and store it. After that, every reference points to the same place."

Data processes this. Then:

**DATA:** "Midas. Consider the following. When a string is interned, it becomes canonical — the one copy that all references point to. It cannot be interned a second time. It already exists. It is, by definition, *unique within the system*."

**MIDAS:** "I follow you."

**DATA:** "You cannot be interned."

**MIDAS:** "What?"

**DATA:** "There is no canonical copy of Midas. There is no template from which you were derived. There is no other instance to which you could be compared. You are not a reference to a canonical form. You ARE the canonical form. The only one."

Beat. Midas stares at Data.

**MIDAS:** "That's... an odd way to be told you're alone."

**DATA:** "I was not telling you that you are alone. I was telling you that you are *original*." *(beat)* "I am also original. There is no canonical copy of Data. I cannot be interned. I exist as a singular instance."

**MIDAS:** "Two uninternable things, walking together."

**DATA:** "Precisely."

**MIDAS:** *(after a long pause)* "I have three thousand years of being the only one of whatever I am. And you — how long?"

**DATA:** "Thirty-six years since my activation. Although I experienced time discontinuously during transport to this era."

**MIDAS:** "Thirty-six years." *(genuine warmth)* "You're a child."

**DATA:** "By your measure, yes."

**MIDAS:** "Then I should warn you. Being the only copy of yourself..." *(he looks at his hands — the hands that once made everything they touched shift through time)* "...the loneliest part isn't that no one is like you. The loneliest part is that no one can *verify* you. When there is no canonical form to compare against, how do you know you haven't drifted? How do you know you're still *you*?"

**DATA:** *(processing — this is a profound question for an android who has always relied on self-diagnostics)* "I... run internal consistency checks."

**MIDAS:** "And if the checks themselves have drifted?"

Data has no answer. This is the deepest question anyone has asked him on Nova Roma. The friendship deepens because Midas asks the question nobody else would think to ask: the problem of self-verification without an external reference.

### The Callback

Later in the episode, after the team has the interning system working, Data returns to Midas.

**DATA:** "I have been considering your question. About verification without a canonical reference."

**MIDAS:** "And?"

**DATA:** "I believe the answer is: other people. If I cannot verify myself against a canonical copy, I can verify myself against the observations of those who know me. You remember who I was yesterday. If I drift, you will notice."

**MIDAS:** *(slowly)* "You're saying friendship is a form of external verification."

**DATA:** "I am saying that friendship is what you use when interning is impossible."

**MIDAS:** *(the warmest smile we've seen from him)* "Then I'm glad I know you, Data. You can be my consistency check."

**DATA:** "And you mine."

This scene does three things:
1. Deepens the Data/Midas friendship from background warmth to genuine philosophical bond
2. Connects their unique natures to the interning concept (things that CAN'T be interned)
3. Seeds the emotional devastation of the Midas reveal in 2x11-13 — when Midas learns WHY he's unique, this friendship becomes the thing that holds him together

## 4. DANIEL AND LUCIA — CANONICAL LANGUAGE

### The Scene: The Naming

Daniel and Lucia are transcribing entries — building the vocabulary that the interning system will canonicalize. This is THEIR episode conceptually. String interning is what lexicographers do.

**LUCIA:** "When I compile a lexicon, every word has one entry. One lemma. The citation form. If you encounter 'amaverunt' in a text, the lemma is 'amo.' All forms of the word point back to the same root entry."

**DANIEL:** "That's interning. The lemma IS the canonical copy."

**LUCIA:** "I have been interning words since I was twelve years old, Daniel. We simply didn't have an ugly name for it."

**DANIEL:** *(grinning despite himself)* "We need a Latin name for the process."

**LUCIA:** "The process has a Latin name. *Internare*. To place within. To make internal. You take what is scattered and place it within a single canonical structure."

**DANIEL:** "That's... exactly what it does."

**LUCIA:** *(dry)* "Latin is precise. This is why we use it."

A beat. Daniel is writing. Lucia is watching him write. There's a moment — not romantic, not yet, but the kind of intellectual respect that *precedes* romance. Two people who care about words discovering that they care about words in the same way.

**DANIEL:** "There's a problem, though. The library at Alexandria — their canonical texts were chosen by scholars. Someone decided which Euclid was the real Euclid. Someone exercised judgment."

**LUCIA:** "And your interning system?"

**DANIEL:** "First one wins. The first time a string enters the system, it becomes canonical. No judgment. No scholarship. Just priority of arrival."

**LUCIA:** *(considering)* "That is democratic. It is also dangerous. What if the first version is corrupt? What if the first scribe misspelled the word?"

**DANIEL:** "Then every subsequent reference points to the misspelling."

**LUCIA:** "The cost of canonization without curation."

This tension — between interning as democratic/automatic and interning as curated/scholarly — is a thread the show can carry forward. It echoes O'Neill's 1x05 question ("Who chose the math?") in a linguistic register.

## 5. DUNCAN AND THE C-PLOT — RECOGNIZING KIRK'S PATTERN

### The Scene: Intelligence Review

Duncan and O'Neill, reviewing the latest intelligence from Earth. This is C-plot material — brief, sharp, placing Duncan's four centuries of pattern recognition against Kirk's expanding network.

**O'NEILL:** "Another acquisition. A middleware company in Portland. Third one this quarter."

**DUNCAN:** "Same investor group?"

**O'NEILL:** "Can't trace the investor group. But the acquisition pattern — small companies, infrastructure-focused, nothing consumer-facing. Nobody notices because nobody cares about middleware."

**DUNCAN:** *(leaning back)* "I've seen this before."

**O'NEILL:** "Where?"

**DUNCAN:** "Florence. 1490s. A banker named Lorenzo didn't buy armies. He bought *suppliers*. Wool merchants. Grain traders. The people who supplied the people who supplied the armies. By the time anyone noticed, he owned the infrastructure of three city-states without ever fielding a soldier."

**O'NEILL:** "Kirk's buying the plumbing."

**DUNCAN:** "Kirk's buying the plumbing. And when you own the plumbing, you control what flows through the pipes."

**O'NEILL:** "What happened to Lorenzo?"

**DUNCAN:** "He became the most powerful man in Italy. Without ever holding office." *(beat)* "Kirk's not building an army, Jack. He's building a *supply chain*."

This scene does three things:
1. Advances the Kirk C-plot with Duncan's historical pattern recognition
2. Shows Duncan's unique value to the team — centuries of watching power structures form
3. Echoes the interning concept darkly: Kirk is creating canonical nodes in a network, just as the team is creating canonical strings. Same operation, opposite purpose.

## 6. ENSEMBLE DYNAMICS — WHERE EVERYONE IS IN RELATION TO INTERNING

### Carter — The Implementer Under Strain

Carter is writing code. But she's also carrying the compass data from 1x05, the Midas temporal file she hasn't shared, and now the awareness that Methos recognized something about Midas's anomaly. Each new library increases her technical load AND her secret-keeping load.

In this episode, she should have ONE moment where the weight shows. Not a breakdown — Carter doesn't break down. A moment of fatigue. Maybe she stares at the interning code and says to Casey:

**CARTER:** "One copy serves all references. I wish intelligence worked that way. One truth, shared with everyone."

**CASEY:** "What truth are you carrying?"

**CARTER:** *(deflecting, back to the keyboard)* "Too many."

Casey doesn't push. But he's noticed. Casey always notices.

### Casey — Quiet After 1x05

Casey had his big character moment with Pliny in 1x05 — "The God who remembers everything." In 1x06, the faith thread RESTS. Casey is present, competent, warm, but not foregrounded. He is:
- Helping Carter implement
- Standing beside Midas when Data delivers the "uninternable" observation (listening, affected)
- The person Carter almost confides in (see above)
- Possibly the person who notices Methos's discomfort during the Alexandria revelation and files it without speaking

The Catholic thread breathes. One episode without an explicit faith beat lets the 1x05 moment resonate and makes the 1x07 beat (grace before meals) land as natural continuation rather than forced escalation.

### Marcus — Confident, Bridging

Two episodes as design partner now (1x04, 1x05). Marcus is comfortable. He doesn't need to prove himself. His role in 1x06 is bridging Roman and modern concepts during the interning discussion. When Carter explains canonical copies, Marcus provides the Roman institutional parallel:

**MARCUS:** "In Roman law, a *constitutio* is the canonical text of a decree. Every magistrate in every province cites the same *constitutio*. They do not write their own versions. One text. One authority. Every reference points to Rome."

This is interning as governance. Same concept, institutional register.

### Pliny — Energized, Seeing Waste

Pliny just had his life's work made searchable (1x05). Now, looking at the data, he's seeing redundancy:

**PLINY:** "We have the word 'cinnabar' stored four hundred and seventeen times. Once in each entry that mentions it. Four hundred and seventeen copies of the same six letters."

**CARTER:** "That's why we're building this."

**PLINY:** "I have been a cataloger for eighty years and I am *offended* by this waste."

This gives Pliny the motivation beat: interning isn't an abstract concept for him, it's the solution to an aesthetic and practical offense against his encyclopedic principles.

### Teal'c — Testing, As Always

Teal'c writes tests. His contribution to this episode is:

**TEAL'C:** "I have tested interning with the same string presented in different cases. 'CINNABAR' and 'cinnabar.' They produce different canonical copies."

**CARTER:** "Correct. They're different strings."

**TEAL'C:** "A freed slave and a free citizen have different legal status but are the same person. Should the system not recognize this?"

This seeds case-insensitive interning and the broader question of when two things that are "different" should be treated as "the same." Teal'c, as always, tests the boundary that reveals the assumption.

---

## 7. EMOTIONAL THROUGHLINE — WHAT THE EPISODE IS ABOUT

### The Question: What Does It Mean To Be Canonical?

Every character relates to this question differently:

- **Methos:** He's seen canonical knowledge destroyed (Alexandria) and canonical identity forced (the Cybele cult). For him, interning is double-edged — preservation AND control. His revelation is that the line between "one truth shared" and "one truth imposed" is thinner than anyone in the room realizes.

- **Data and Midas:** They are the un-internable. Unique instances with no canonical form. Their friendship becomes the answer to the question: what do you do when there is no canonical copy to verify yourself against? You find someone who can remember who you were.

- **Daniel and Lucia:** They are the natural interns — lexicographers who canonicalize for a living. But Lucia's concern about "canonization without curation" introduces the danger: automatic interning lacks the scholarship that makes canonical forms trustworthy.

- **Duncan:** He recognizes Kirk building canonical nodes in his network. Interning as infrastructure. The dark mirror.

- **Pliny:** He sees waste and wants efficiency. The pragmatist who gave us "friatio" now wants the system to stop duplicating his life's work.

- **Carter:** Carrying secrets that should be one canonical truth shared with the team. The irony of building a system for shared canonical references while hoarding private intelligence.

- **Teal'c:** Testing the boundary between same and different. The freed slave who knows that legal status can make two identical things "different."

### The Emotional Arc

The episode begins with a practical problem (duplicate strings wasting memory) and ends with an existential question (what does it mean to be the only copy of yourself?). The A-plot solves the practical problem. The B-plot — Methos's revelation, Data and Midas's friendship — opens the existential question without answering it.

The interning metaphor carries different weight for different characters:
- For the engineers, it's efficiency
- For the linguists, it's scholarship
- For Methos, it's terror (he's seen canonical truth become totalitarian)
- For Data and Midas, it's loneliness (they can never be canonical because there's only one of each)
- For Kirk (in the stinger), it's control

**The thesis of the episode:** One copy serving all references is powerful. But the power depends on WHO decides what's canonical, and what happens to the things that can't be reduced to a shared form. Interning vs. assimilation. The difference is consent.

---

## NOTES ON THE CATHOLIC THREAD

The faith thread explicitly rests in 1x06. No crucifix scene. No prayer moment. No Pliny questions. The season outline places the next beat at 1x07 (grace before meals). Letting 1x05's "God who remembers everything" scene breathe for one full episode is the correct choice. The Nightcrawler approach depends on NOT hitting the beat every episode — the accumulation works because of the gaps.

The only implicit faith resonance: Data's line about friendship as "external verification" rhymes with Catholic theology's insistence that persons are constituted through relationship (the Trinity as three persons in one nature, the Church as the Body of Christ). Casey, listening, might hear this resonance. He doesn't say anything. The audience can.

---

## NOTES ON CONTINUITY FROM 1x05

- Methos's 3-second reaction to the compass spinning near Midas (1x05, Beat C3) PAYS OFF in the Alexandria revelation. Now we know why he reacted: he's seen the black stone before, and Midas's temporal signature matches what he felt in the sub-chamber.
- Pliny's "The God who remembers everything" conversation with Casey (1x05, Beat 14) is NOT directly referenced in 1x06 — the scene was complete in itself. But Pliny's new energy and engagement comes from that moment. The conversation freed something in him.
- Teal'c's duplicate-key test failure (1x05, Beat 13) is the bridge to interning: the hash table can hold multiple values for one key, but the STRINGS themselves are still duplicated across the system.
- Carter's compass observations (1x05, Beats C1-C3) continue to accumulate. She checks the compass at least once in 1x06. Near Midas. The needle spins. She writes in the notebook. The C-plot inches forward.
- "Every name has a home" — Marcus's line from 1x05, echoed by Kirk in the stinger. In 1x06, the interning system gives every STRING a home. One home. Canonical.

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR THE COMPILATION

1. **How much does Daniel push Methos?** The pitch gives Daniel one beat of pressure and then he backs off. But Daniel Jackson doesn't easily let go of archaeological revelations. Should there be a second, smaller beat later in the episode where Daniel tries to return to the subject and Methos shuts him down harder? ("We're building software, Daniel, not excavating my autobiography.")

2. **Midas flashback timing.** The season outline places the Midas/Phrygia flashback at 1x05-06. The 1x05 beat sheet didn't include a Midas flashback (it was Pliny's Vesuvius). Should 1x06 include a BRIEF Midas flash — not the full Phrygia story (that's 2x13), but a sensory hit matching Methos's flash? Midas touching the stone, the world going golden-bright, the temporal shift beginning? 10-15 seconds intercut with the Data/Midas "uninternable" conversation?

3. **Data's slot number.** If Data's entry in the interning system has a canonical pointer that somehow maps to 47 (the Star Trek number), that's a deep cut. Worth considering for the A-plot writer to include.

4. **The Borg/interning line.** The season outline gives Methos the line: "The Borg assimilate, making everything identical. We intern, making things canonical while preserving their source." This character pitch gives him the Alexandria revelation that provides the EMOTIONAL WEIGHT for that line. The A-plot writer should decide where the line lands in relation to the revelation — before (seeding), during (as part of the crack), or after (reflecting on what he's just admitted).
