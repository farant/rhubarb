## A. STRUCTURAL DECISIONS

### Beat Count and Act Structure

**Recommendation: ~19 beats** (Cold Open + 5 Acts + Tag + Stinger, with 4 C-Plot beats and the Gilfoyle/Dinesh introduction interwoven).

The A-plot writer's act structure provides the backbone. Five acts tracking six STML extensions, each with a clear dramatic function:

| Section | Beats | Content |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Cold Open | 1 | Daniel can't write the STML manual in STML. The language can't describe itself. |
| Act One: "Crudus" (The Raw) | Beats 1-3 | Raw content tags solve self-description. The `!` suffix. Teal'c tests boundaries. |
| Act Two: "Fragmenta" (The Fragments) | Beats 4-6 | Fragments (grouping without semantics). Labels (multi-axis classification). Lucia's realism insight. |
| Act Three: "Captio" (The Capture) | Beats 7-9 | Casey's warning. Forward capture. Backward + sandwich. Guardrails. |
| Act Four: "Transclusio" (The Inclusion) | Beats 10-13 + Three-Voice | Transclusion. Deep clone. Dependency story. Three-voice. |
| Act Five: "Lingua Nova" (The New Language) | Beats 14-15 | Convergence demo. Title moment. Full round trip. |
| Tag | Beats 16-17 + C-plot closings | Daniel's manual. Pliny's variant edition. Joe/Methos post-reunion. Carter/Casey silence cracks. |
| Stinger | Beat 18 | Kirk's INSTRUMENTA. |
| C-Plot | Beats G1-G2, C1-C3 | Gilfoyle/Dinesh introduction. Carter temporal. Daniel investigation. O'Neill intelligence. Data/Midas. |

## B. CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### Conflict 1: Kirk Stinger Word — INSTRUMENTA vs. GRAMMATICA

**Threads pitch:** INSTRUMENTA (tools, instruments, methods). Kirk develops intelligence methodology — fragments as composite profiles, captures as reference-not-copy, transclusion as live data pulls. FRAGMENTUM cards for MacLeod, Casey, Methos. 10/31.

**Genre pitch:** GRAMMATICA (grammar). Kirk now has rules for operating on what he knows. "The rules now have rules." The parallel: the team gives the tree verbs, Kirk gives his intelligence verbs.

**DECISION: Use INSTRUMENTA (threads writer).**

Reasoning:

1. **GRAMMATICA is too abstract** for Kirk's character. Kirk is operational, not theoretical. He doesn't think in terms of grammar — he thinks in terms of tools, methods, tradecraft. INSTRUMENTA matches his voice.

2. **The threads writer's FRAGMENTUM cards are excellent.** Kirk using "FRAGMENTUM" for his composite profiles — partial intelligence assembled from multiple sources, not resolving into a single authoritative identity — is the dark mirror of Pliny's scholarly fragments. This is the kind of specific operational detail that makes the stinger land.

3. **The METHOS FRAGMENTUM card** (almost blank, one unverified reference to 280 BC Watcher record) is a masterful thread plant. Kirk has picked up a trace. He doesn't know who Methos is. He knows someone is very carefully hidden. This escalates Kirk's investigation without requiring exposition.

4. **The progression holds:** TABULARIUM → LEXICON → ARCHIVUM → CHRONOGRAPHIA → TAXONOMIA → INSTRUMENTA. Indexing → standardizing → persisting → timing → classifying → *methodizing*. Each word represents a more sophisticated level of intelligence tradecraft.

5. **From the genre fan:** The parallel mapping (fragments→composites, captures→references, transclusion→surveillance, deep clone→untraceable copies) is excellent and should be preserved in the thematic notes. The dark mirror is strongest when each STML feature has a specific Kirk counterpart.

### Conflict 2: Three-Voice — Lucia/Carter/Data vs. Lucia/Marcus/Data vs. Daniel/Pliny/Data

**Character pitch:** Lucia/Marcus/Data. The philosopher, the engineer, the android. Topic: extensions as recognition of new kinds of being (Lucia), as practical infrastructure (Marcus), as formal type systems (Data). First time Lucia and Marcus enter the three-voice.

**Genre pitch:** Lucia/Carter/Data. Lucia on grammar ("You added grammar. The tree can conjugate."), Carter on dual use ("Every tool has a dual use... Powerful tools require honest hands."), Data on relaxed constraints preserving deeper invariants.

**A-plot pitch:** Defers to other writers. Notes placement in late Act 4 after all features demonstrated.

**DECISION: Use Lucia/Carter/Data (genre fan's trio), with Lucia's content drawn from BOTH character and genre pitches, Carter from genre pitch, and Data from genre pitch.**

Reasoning:

1. **Lucia MUST be in the three-voice.** This is her second major moment. She articulates the episode's thesis ("Things must be allowed to be what they are"). She enters the three-voice for the first time. This is earned and overdue.

2. **Carter over Marcus.** Carter built the extensions. This is HER work. Her dual-use reflection — "Every extension is a tool. And every tool has a dual use. Raw content protects poetry. It also hides information." — adds moral weight that Marcus's engineering lens doesn't provide. Carter is carrying the Midas secret, the capture operators she builds can restructure and surveil — the dual-use tension is personal for her. Marcus is present and active throughout the episode; he doesn't need the three-voice for visibility.

3. **Data as the constant.** He's been in every three-voice. His speech about relaxed constraints preserving deeper invariants — "Each extension relaxes a constraint of the original tree while preserving a deeper invariant" — is the formal anchor.

4. **The rotation opens up:** {Pliny/Data/Casey → Methos/Data/Casey → Joe/Pliny/Data → Casey/Methos/Data → Daniel/Pliny/Data → **Lucia/Carter/Data**}. Three new entrants in two episodes (Daniel in 1x09, Lucia+Carter in 1x10). The ensemble grows.

5. **Lucia's speech: MERGE.** Use the genre fan's Latin-grammar framework ("Your extensions are cases for the tree... the raw tag is the ablative... the capture is the accusative... you did not add features, you added grammar") combined with the character writer's philosophical anchor ("Things are what they are. A fragment IS a fragment."). The grammar metaphor gives structure; the realism principle gives weight.

### Conflict 3: Lucia's Realism Insight — Placement and Version

**A-plot pitch (Beat 6):** Mid Act 2, after fragments demonstrated. "Your old system treated all things the same... Your new system lets things be what they are. A fragment is not an element wearing a costume. It IS a fragment." Carter surprised by philosophical precision. Room feels the weight.

**Character pitch:** Two-part. Mid Act 2 (fragment insight — "A fragment declares its own transparency... That is a SPECIFIC nature — the nature of structural service without semantic claim") and Late Act 3 (labels — "Labels are not categories imposed from outside. They are properties recognized from within").

**Threads pitch (Section 9):** "Procrustean" critique. "Your old system was Procrustean. If something didn't fit the three types, you stretched it or cut it until it did."

**DECISION: Use the A-PLOT writer's placement (Beat 6, end of Act 2) as the single concentrated moment, drawing the Procrustean critique from the threads writer and the "declares its own transparency" language from the character writer.**

Reasoning:

1. **One scene, not two.** Splitting Lucia's insight across Acts 2 and 3 dilutes the impact. The realism moment should be ONE concentrated philosophical bomb that the audience feels. Place it at the end of Act 2 as the act break — the fragments and labels have been demonstrated, Lucia synthesizes.

2. **The Procrustean metaphor (threads writer) is too good to lose.** "Procrustes — the Greek bandit who cut or stretched travelers to fit his bed." This is the nominalist position given a mythological face. Include it, but briefly — Lucia names Procrustes in one line, moves to the conclusion.

3. **"Declares its own transparency" (character writer) is the best single line.** A fragment is not an element that pretends to have no meaning. It is a thing whose nature IS structural transparency. This is the sharpest formulation.

4. **The label extension of the insight (character writer's Late Act 3 scene) should be FOLDED into the same Beat 6 scene.** After the fragment insight, Lucia extends to labels: "Labels are not categories imposed from outside. They are properties recognized from within... The label is an act of recognition, not an act of creation." This deepens the thesis without requiring a second scene.

5. **Naming matters:** Nobody in the scene names "moderate realism." Carter says "That's exactly the design principle." Lucia says "It is also the first principle of any sound philosophy." The audience who knows philosophy recognizes it. The audience who doesn't knows something important was said. The Nightcrawler approach applied to epistemology.

### Conflict 4: Daniel's Coined Term — "Transclusio" vs. "Inclusio Remota"

**Character pitch:** Daniel coins "transclusio" — trans (across) + clusio (from claudere, to enclose). "This word doesn't exist in any language. Not Latin, not English. It describes something that couldn't exist before structured documents." Lucia: "You didn't translate this time. You created."

**Threads pitch (Section 11):** Lucia challenges "transclusio" as a barbarism. Proposes "inclusio remota" (remote inclusion). Daniel concedes. A brief Daniel/Lucia work scene showing professional collaboration and intellectual tension.

**Historian pitch:** Notes "transclusio" is a neologism but well-formed Latin. Also notes "inclusio" is "too close to inclusion" and doesn't capture the cross-referential nature.

**DECISION: Use the CHARACTER writer's "transclusio" as the coinage that STICKS, but INCLUDE the threads writer's Lucia challenge as the dramatic pathway to get there.**

Reasoning:

1. **"Transclusio" is already in the API** (`STML_NODUS_TRANSCLUSIO`). The code exists. The show must match the code. The term must survive.

2. **But the debate is dramatically excellent.** Lucia challenges "transclusio" as a barbarism → Daniel defends → Lucia proposes "inclusio remota" → Daniel thinks → Daniel argues back ("inclusio remota implies passive receipt — the content is placed here by someone else. Transclusio implies the document REACHES across and encloses content from elsewhere. The agency is in the document, not in an external actor.") → Lucia pauses → Lucia accepts. This shows Daniel as a genuine linguistic creator — he doesn't just coin, he DEFENDS the coinage against a Roman Latin speaker.

3. **This is Daniel's 1x10 coinage completing what "stirps" began in 1x09.** "Stirps" came from listening (Pliny supplied the word, Daniel recognized the moment). "Transclusio" comes from creating AND defending. The progression: translator → listener → creator → *advocate*.

4. **Lucia's "You didn't translate this time. You created." STAYS** (character writer). Place it AFTER the debate. The acknowledgment lands harder because she fought him first.

5. **Timing:** 45 seconds total. Embedded in the transclusion demonstration scene. Not a separate scene — an exchange within a scene.

### Conflict 5: O'Neill's Dossier — Scope and Visibility

**Character pitch:** O'Neill at a terminal, ALONE. Building a structured intelligence dossier on Nova Roma's operations. Carter finds him. "You're... writing STML." / "I've been watching you for nine episodes, Carter." The dossier includes temporal anomaly tracking. Key line: "A filing system. For things that keep me awake."

**Threads pitch (Section 4, Scene A):** O'Neill reviews acquisitions data with Joe. Flags Vexillum AI (Gilfoyle/Dinesh's company) as the one firm that hasn't been acquired. "These two just... didn't." This is the setup for the G&D introduction.

**Threads pitch (Section 10):** Brief beat — O'Neill adds to his temporal intelligence file. "Four data points. Five if I count Casey's clocks." 15 seconds.

**DECISION: COMBINE. O'Neill has TWO beats: (1) the Vexillum AI flagging scene with Joe (30 seconds, leads into G&D introduction), and (2) the private dossier scene where Carter finds him (60 seconds, late Act 4). Cut the temporal file update to a visual — it's embedded in the dossier Carter sees.**

Reasoning:

1. **The Vexillum AI scene is structurally necessary.** It's the narrative bridge to the Gilfoyle/Dinesh introduction. O'Neill on Nova Roma flags the company → cut to Earth, G&D's office. This is clean, economical storytelling.

2. **The private dossier scene is the character payoff** from deferring O'Neill's XML work from 1x09. "I've been watching you for nine episodes, Carter" is a great line. But trim it: Carter finds him, sees the dossier, is surprised. O'Neill: "Organized information wins wars." Done. Cut the full STML markup display (the episode already has heavy code density). The dossier is VISIBLE on screen but not read in detail.

3. **The temporal tracking is embedded.** Carter sees a section labeled "Anomaliae Temporales" in O'Neill's dossier. She recognizes it. Brief look. No dialogue about it. The audience connects it to her own secret data. O'Neill is circling the same thing from the intelligence side.

4. **Key line: "A filing system. For things that keep me awake."** Keep it (character writer). It's O'Neill at his best — the general who plays dumb but files everything.

### Conflict 6: Gilfoyle/Dinesh Introduction — Length and Tone

**Threads pitch:** Two scenes, 90-105 seconds total. Scene A (30 sec): O'Neill/Joe flag Vexillum AI. Scene B (60-75 sec): The email scene. Gilfoyle deleting. Dinesh resisting. Henderson pivot. "I counted." Dinesh's hidden Reddit tab.

**Genre pitch:** Focuses on the tonal boundary rule: registers should NEVER bleed into each other within a scene. G&D scenes are pure Silicon Valley. Maps Gilfoyle as "raw content" (refuses to parse) and Dinesh as "transclusion" (always referencing external content).

**Historian pitch:** Recommends 90-120 seconds. Enough to establish: they exist, they're independent, weird emails, Gilfoyle's refusal.

**DECISION: Use the THREADS writer's two-scene structure (30 + 60-75 seconds, ~105 total). Incorporate the genre fan's tonal boundary note as a production direction.**

Reasoning:

1. **The two-scene structure is architecturally clean.** Nova Roma scene (O'Neill flags) → Earth scene (G&D's office). The cut across registers IS the introduction — the audience experiences the tonal shift as a feature, not a problem.

2. **The full scene (threads writer, 60-75 seconds) is worth the time.** The Henderson observation ("Henderson pivoted his company from cybersecurity to 'unified consciousness platforms' three days after the dinner"), the phrase-counting revelation ("eleven different CEOs use the exact same phrases in the exact same order"), and Dinesh's hidden Reddit tab are all load-bearing. They establish: (a) Gilfoyle's pattern recognition, (b) the scale of the Borg infiltration, (c) Dinesh's secret concern. You can't do this in 30 seconds.

3. **The genre fan's tonal boundary rule is a production direction, not a beat.** Include it in the beat sheet's production notes: "G&D scenes are pure Silicon Valley register. No Latin. No philosophical weight. The comedy is the characterization."

4. **The genre fan's STML-as-character mapping** (Gilfoyle = raw content, Dinesh = transclusion) belongs in the thematic notes, not in the scenes themselves. The audience should discover the parallel, not have it stated.

### Conflict 7: Casey Faith Thread — Rest vs. Minimal Visual

**Threads pitch:** REST. Visual only. Rosary beside keyboard. Casey glances at it during a frustration, moves it, goes back to work. 3 seconds embedded in an A-plot scene. "The faith thread is present without consuming screen time."

**Character pitch:** REST. "No faith beat. The Nightcrawler approach — accumulate, then rest, then accumulate again." Rosary visible. Nobody comments.

**A-plot pitch:** No faith content (appropriate — A-plot focus).

**DECISION: Use the THREADS writer's specific visual — rosary beside keyboard, glance during deep-clone frustration, move, back to work. 3 seconds.**

Reasoning:

1. **Both writers agree: REST.** After 1x09's dense patronage/Salii/stirps conversation, the faith thread breathes.

2. **The threads writer's specific visual is better than generic "rosary visible."** The GLANCE during frustration with deep-clone semantics (the copy is orphaned until attached — a node with no parent) rhymes with Casey's faith: the anchor that provides stability when the work is disorienting. This is visible to the attentive viewer and invisible to the casual viewer. Nightcrawler approach.

3. **3 seconds. Zero dialogue.** The lightest possible touch. The season outline calls for the next escalation at 1x11-12 ("Before battle?" / "Before everything."). Resting now makes that land harder.

### Conflict 8: Carter/Casey Temporal Revelation Scene — Placement and Length

**Threads pitch:** Private late-night scene. 60-75 seconds. Carter tells Casey the full picture: emotional-state correlation. "It responds to him. Not just biologically. Emotionally." Casey: "Who else knows?" Carter: "Nobody. You. Now." Casey: "Then who do we tell?" The conspiracy of silence deepens and simultaneously cracks — Carter SAID it out loud.

**A-plot pitch:** No competing version (A-plot focused on technical features).

**Character pitch:** No competing version (defers C-plot to threads writer).

**DECISION: INCLUDE at 60 seconds. Place in the Tag area, after the title moment. Private, late-night, two people with a secret.**

Reasoning:

1. **This is the episode's emotional C-plot core.** The threads writer has calibrated it perfectly: Carter saying the words out loud for the first time is the crack in the silence. The question shifting from "tell someone?" to "who and how?" is the right escalation for 1x10.

2. **60 seconds, not 75.** Trim the extended "who do we tell" dialogue. Carter names the problem: "If we tell O'Neill, he acts. If we tell Daniel, he investigates." Casey: "Someone who cares about him." Carter: "Yes." Done. The audience fills in the rest.

3. **Place in Tag.** The A-plot resolves in Act 5 (convergence + title moment). The Tag is where character secrets live — same placement as the Joe/Methos reunion in 1x09.

4. **Thematic resonance (threads writer's observation) is excellent:** The A-plot features are about how you handle content with relationships. Carter's dilemma IS the philosophical problem: how do you share information deeply integrated with its source? Include in thematic notes.

### Conflict 9: Carter/Marcus Deep Clone Scene — Co-Architecture or Carter Solo?

**Character pitch:** Carter and Marcus build deep clone TOGETHER. Census versioning problem → Marcus's aqueduct analogy ("We do not destroy the old aqueduct. We build alongside it.") → They write it together (Carter handles recursion, Marcus handles edge cases). "In Rome, the man who designs the aqueduct and the man who builds it are different men. Here, we are both." The deepening romance through collaboration.

**A-plot pitch (Beat 11):** Carter demonstrates deep clone as a feature. Pliny provides the variant-editions metaphor. Daniel notes "stirps again." A technical demonstration with character color.

**DECISION: Use the A-PLOT writer's deep clone demonstration (Beat 11) as the primary scene, but INJECT the character writer's Carter/Marcus collaboration into it — specifically Marcus's aqueduct analogy and the "we are both" line.**

Reasoning:

1. **The A-plot beat has better flow.** Beat 11 follows transclusion (Beat 10) naturally — transclusion is reference, deep clone is copy. The A-plot writer's Pliny variant-editions metaphor ("A copy that grows into its own tree") is the deep clone's best dramatization.

2. **But Carter/Marcus needs screen time.** The season outline says "Carter/Marcus deepens." The character writer's collaboration — Marcus providing practical test cases the physicist wouldn't think of (twins born, family moves districts, someone dies) — shows them as PEERS for the first time. Include this.

3. **"We are both" stays.** Marcus's line is the scene's emotional beat. Carter hears engineering partnership. The audience hears the beginning of something else. "Professional warmth. The audience sees it before the characters do."

4. **Cut the aqueduct analogy.** Marcus has already had one infrastructure metaphor this episode (scaffolding for fragments, Beat 4). The aqueduct is redundant. Replace with Marcus providing the practical edge case: "What happens when twins are born during census? The old tree needs the old count. The new tree needs two new nodes." Carter: "That's exactly the use case."

### Conflict 10: Joe/Methos Post-Reunion Scene — Placement and Content

**Character pitch:** Late evening tavern. Wine. Joe converting Chronicles to STML. Methos appears. Joe shows cross-referencing: Observer W-4419 documented four Immortals, 1620-1640. One match to 280 BC Alexandria description. Methos's sardonic ease drops by one degree. "Observers are trained to notice movement patterns." The investigation tightens. 45-60 seconds.

**Threads pitch:** Joe bar-scouting with Marcus (30 sec). Joe/Pliny working session with fragments (20 sec). No explicit Joe/Methos scene in 1x10 — the reunion happened in 1x09, the dynamic is "comfortable" now.

**DECISION: Use the CHARACTER writer's Joe/Methos scene (trimmed to 45 seconds) in the Tag. ALSO include the threads writer's bar-scouting beat (30 seconds) earlier as a C-plot transition.**

Reasoning:

1. **Joe/Methos needs a scene in 1x10.** After 1x09's reunion (the longest C-plot beat in the season), 1x10 should show what the post-reunion dynamic LOOKS like. The character writer's scene does this perfectly: comfortable, professional, the investigation tightening through the structured data (STML cross-referencing makes connections visible).

2. **Trim to 45 seconds.** The core is: Joe shows Methos the cross-reference result. Methos reacts minimally. "Observers are trained to notice movement patterns." Joe: "They're trained to notice everything." The scene establishes that STML tools are accelerating the investigation. Done.

3. **Bar scouting (threads writer) seeds 1x13.** Include it, 30 seconds, Joe and Marcus look at a vacant taberna. "A bar. A place where people sit and talk and drink." Marcus: "I want to help you build a *good* bar." This is world-building that pays off three episodes later.

4. **Cut the Joe/Pliny working session.** The episode is dense. Joe/Pliny was established in 1x09. It continues implicitly through the Watcher cross-reference data Joe brings to the Methos scene.

### Conflict 11: Data/Midas Friendship Scene — Open vs. Subtle

**Threads pitch (Section 8):** Data notices a pattern in Midas's anecdotes: they cluster around preservation, survival, persistence of structure. Data tells Midas openly: "I have observed that your anecdotes cluster around specific themes." Midas: "My memories are the only thing I have that is truly mine. Of course they have patterns." 45 seconds. Advances friendship AND gives Data observational data.

**Character pitch:** Midas 30-second walk-through with Cybele/Phrygia anecdote ("the voice that walks"). Carter files it from across the room.

**DECISION: Use the THREADS writer's Data/Midas scene (45 seconds) as a C-plot beat, AND the character writer's Midas walk-through (30 seconds) as the Midas comedy beat. Two separate Midas beats.**

Reasoning:

1. **The Data/Midas scene is too important to cut.** "Your memories have patterns" is Data beginning observational analysis of Midas. This seeds the entire back-half arc. Data noticing what Carter measures instrumentally — approached through friendship instead of science.

2. **OPEN, not subtle.** The threads writer is right: telling Midas directly and getting his reaction is more dramatically interesting than Data noticing silently. Midas's response ("My memories are the only thing I have that is truly mine") reveals character AND deepens the mystery. The audience hears it differently from Midas.

3. **The character writer's Midas walk-through is the comedy beat.** "In Phrygia, the oracles did this..." — the Cybele cult reference, casual, cheerful, devastating. Carter files it. This is the standard Midas pattern (30 seconds, hiding in plain sight).

4. **Two Midas beats (75 seconds total) is acceptable** because they serve different functions: the comedy beat advances the A-plot (transclusion metaphor) and the Cybele thread, while the Data scene advances the friendship thread and Carter C-plot (parallel investigation).

### Conflict 12: Midas Comedy Beat — Which Anecdote?

**Character pitch:** Midas walk-through during transclusion demo. Cybele oracle anecdote: "A priest in the temple of Cybele could speak, and his words would be heard in the oracle chamber three hills away. They called it 'the voice that walks.'" 30 seconds.

**Threads pitch (Section 12):** Midas during fragment discussion. Lydian scribes under Croesus: "A text without a name is a rumor. A text with a name is a law." Merchants wrote anonymous proposals — fragments, unsigned. If popular, someone claimed it. If not, no one was responsible. Casey: "So fragments enable plausible deniability." 20 seconds.

**DECISION: Use the CHARACTER writer's Cybele anecdote for the Midas walk-through. The Lydian fragment anecdote is charming but the Cybele reference is more important for the season arc.**

Reasoning:

1. **The Cybele reference advances the Black Stone/Borg thread.** Every casual Cybele mention from Midas is a breadcrumb. "The temple of Cybele" → connects to the Serapeum (Cybele documented in 1x09 dossier) → connects to the stone → connects to Midas himself. The audience builds the pattern.

2. **"The voice that walks" is a perfect transclusion metaphor.** Content that lives in one place and appears in another. The parallel is clean and earns its place in the A-plot scene.

3. **The Lydian anecdote is good but doesn't advance threads.** Save it for a later Midas moment or cut it. The episode has enough fragment motivation from Pliny.

### Conflict 13: Daniel's Investigation — How Much Screen Time?

**Threads pitch (Section 5):** Extended. New Watcher records from Alexandrian period — cluster of observations 300-250 BC. Multiple subjects affected by Serapeum lower levels. "Unum corpus, una mens" phrase documented. 45 seconds with XML on screen.

**Character pitch:** No specific Daniel investigation beat (Daniel's coinage is the focus).

**DECISION: INCLUDE the threads writer's investigation beat, compressed to 30 seconds. The "unum corpus, una mens" phrase is the critical plant.**

Reasoning:

1. **"Unum corpus, una mens" is too important to defer.** This is Borg language showing up in 280 BC Watcher records. The audience recognizes it; Daniel doesn't. This is the kind of plant that rewards rewatching.

2. **30 seconds, not 45.** Show the XML briefly (5 seconds on screen). Daniel reads the phrase aloud. Notes the pattern: "The same phrase, across multiple subjects, after contact with the lower levels." Files it. Moves on. The audience does the work.

3. **Place during an A-plot transition** (between acts or during a work-session montage). Not a dedicated scene — an embedded C-plot beat.

---

## C. BEAT SHEET ORDER (Final)

| Beat | Content | Act | Source(s) |
|------|---------|-----|-----------|
| Cold Open | Daniel can't write the STML manual in STML. `<elementum>` inside `<code>` parsed as structure. "The language cannot describe itself." Pliny: "An encyclopedia must be able to contain any subject — including itself." Carter: "Then we extend the language." | Pre-titles | A-plot |
| 1 | Carter's raw content proposal. The `!` suffix. `<code!>` — parser doesn't interpret contents. Daniel tests it: angle brackets preserved. Pliny: "The encyclopedia can contain itself." Lucia: "The exclamation mark is a warning. Like a sign at the gate of a quarry." O'Neill: "So it's the 'don't touch this' tag." | Act 1 | A-plot |
| 2 | The manual comes alive. Daniel writes first page of STML manual IN STML. Pliny: "A document about documents can contain documents." Marcus: "A building that contains its own blueprints." Raw content as *verba certa* (historian's parallel — brief reference). | Act 1 | A-plot + Historian |
| 3 | Teal'c tests the boundary. Closing tag inside raw content. Nested raw tags. "Inside a raw tag, nothing is parsed. The boundary is inviolable." Carter: "Raw means raw. No exceptions." Teal'c: "Acceptable." **ACT BREAK.** | Act 1 | A-plot |
| 4 | The grouping problem. Pliny needs to group related observations without naming the group. Carter: fragments — `<#>` and `</#>`. "A container without a name." Pliny: "Like parentheses in an equation." Daniel: "They change how you READ the expression." Marcus: "Scaffolding." Historian parallel: *excerpta*, *florilegia* (brief). | Act 2 | A-plot + Historian |
| 5 | Named fragments and labels. `<#introduction>`. Carter introduces label system: `labels="minerale stabiae verificatum"`. Pliny's multi-dimensional classification ("My index was a separate volume... Now the entry CARRIES its categories"). Namespaces: `classis::minerale locus::stabiae`. Marcus recognizes *tria nomina*. | Act 2 | A-plot + Historian + Character |
| 6 | Lucia's realism insight. "Your old system was Procrustean... A fragment is not an element wearing a costume. It IS a fragment. It declares its own transparency. That is not the ABSENCE of nature. That is a SPECIFIC nature." Extended: "Labels are not categories imposed from outside. They are properties recognized from within. The label is an act of recognition, not creation." Carter: "That's exactly the design principle." Lucia: "It is also the first principle of any sound philosophy. Things must be allowed to be what they are." The room feels the weight. **ACT BREAK.** | Act 2 | A-plot + Character + Threads |
| C1 | Midas comedy beat: Cybele oracle walk-through during transclusion discussion prep. "The voice that walks." Carter files it from across the room. | (Act 2-3) | Character |
| 7 | Casey's warning. Casey and Carter, early. "Capture operators. That's the one that worries me." Carter explains: forward, backward, sandwich. "If someone writes conflicting captures?" Carter: "STML_ERROR_CAPTIO. The captures have rules." Casey: "If it can fail safely, I'll accept it. If it can fail silently, we don't ship it." Stakes established. | Act 3 | A-plot |
| 8 | Forward capture demonstration. `<wrapper (>` captures next sibling. `((>` captures two. Marcus: "Like a foreman claiming a worker." Daniel's inflection insight: "This is like Latin. The word order doesn't determine meaning. The ENDINGS do. Capture operators do the same — structure is in the operators, not the nesting." On-screen code: `captio_directio`, `captio_numerus`. | Act 3 | A-plot |
| 9 | Backward capture and sandwich. `<) wrapper>` reaches backward. `<= wrapper =>` captures both directions. Casey studies backward capture: "It rewrites history." Carter: three guardrails (can't exceed parent, can't overlap, execute in order). Overlapping captures → `STML_ERROR_CAPTIO`. Casey: "It fails explicitly... Okay. I can live with that." Historian parallel: *adrogatio* (backward capture as retroactive adoption). **ACT BREAK.** | Act 3 | A-plot + Historian |
| C2 | O'Neill/Joe: Intelligence review. O'Neill flags Vexillum AI — the one firm not acquired. "Every other company in their sector got bought or went weird. These two just... didn't." Joe: "You want to make contact?" O'Neill: "Not yet." → LEADS TO G&D SCENE. | (Act 3) | Threads |
| G1 | **EARTH: Gilfoyle & Dinesh introduction.** Unremarkable office. Servers humming. Gilfoyle eating cereal. Dinesh reads investor email: "Convergence Leadership Dinner." Gilfoyle: "Delete it." Henderson pivot observation. "Eleven different CEOs use the exact same phrases in the exact same order within 72 hours." Dinesh's hidden Reddit tab. | (Act 3) | Threads + Genre |
| 10 | Transclusion. Carter: `<<selector>>` — the document references itself. `<<#main-header>>` includes content from elsewhere. Pliny: "Cross-referencing. 'See also' without duplicating." Daniel's transclusio coinage — Lucia challenges ("barbarism"), Daniel defends ("the agency is in the document"), Lucia accepts. Lucia: "You didn't translate this time. You created." Casey on circular references: depth limit, explicit failure. Midas walk-through: "the voice that walks" (see C1 — can be placed here or in Act 2-3 transition). | Act 4 | A-plot + Character + Threads |
| 11 | Deep clone + Carter/Marcus. `stml_duplicare`. Pliny: variant editions. "A copy that grows into its own tree." Carter/Marcus co-build: Marcus provides practical edge cases (census versioning). Marcus: "Here, we are both." Daniel: "Stirps again." Data on the structure: each extension adds to `StmlNodus` without requiring new libraries. | Act 4 | A-plot + Character |
| 12 | Dependency story. Carter at the board: same dependencies as 1x09. No new libraries. "Every new feature uses the same infrastructure." Marcus: "The foundation bore the load. That is the mark of a good foundation." | Act 4 | A-plot |
| C3 | Data/Midas friendship: "Your memories have patterns." Midas tells Babylonian copying story. Data observes anecdote clustering: preservation, survival, persistence. "This is not a random distribution." Midas: "My memories are the only thing I have that is truly mine." Data files it. | (Act 4) | Threads |
| 3-Voice | Lucia / Carter / Data. **Lucia:** "Your extensions are cases for the tree. The raw tag is the ablative — separated, protected. The capture is the accusative — reaching out, claiming. The fragment is the vocative — addressing without stating. You did not add features. You added grammar. The tree can conjugate." **Carter:** "Every extension is a tool. And every tool has a dual use. Raw content protects poetry. It also hides information. Capture operators restructure for clarity. They also restructure for control... Powerful tools require honest hands." **Data:** "Each extension relaxes a constraint while preserving a deeper invariant. Raw content relaxes parsing but preserves containment. Captures relax nesting but preserve parentage. The extensions are not exceptions to the tree's rules. They are the tree's rules, stated more precisely." | (Late Act 4) | Genre + Character |
| C4 | Daniel's investigation: "unum corpus, una mens." New Watcher records, 300-250 BC. Multiple subjects affected by Serapeum lower levels. Daniel reads the phrase aloud, notes the pattern. Doesn't recognize the significance. 30 seconds. | (Act 4-5) | Threads |
| 13 | Convergence demo. Casey runs full document using ALL features: raw content, fragments, labels, capture, transclusion. Round trip works. "Six new features. And the round trip works." Carter: "The language is never complete. It's designed to grow." Casey: "Fair enough. The framework is complete." | Act 5 | A-plot |
| 14 | Title moment. Lucia stands. "This is no longer a dialect of someone else's notation. This is our language. A new language. Not translated. Born here." Writes LINGUA NOVA STRUCTURAE on the board. Lucia maps each extension to linguistic function. Daniel: "We started with angle brackets. Now we have a philosophy." Pliny: final word — the Tabularium parallel, structure in the text, author and machine read the same document. **Full serialization.** Round trip: parse → serialize → save → read → parse again. | Act 5 | A-plot |
| 15 | Tag: Daniel's manual — alone. Late evening. Writing the STML manual that was impossible in the cold open. `<!-- Haec lingua nata est in Nova Roma. Non translata — nata. -->` | Tag | A-plot |
| 16 | Tag: Pliny's variant edition. `stml_duplicare`. Technical edition for engineers. "Two editions. From one root. The monks of Montecassino would understand." | Tag | A-plot |
| C5 | Tag: Joe/Methos. Late evening. Wine. Joe shows Methos cross-referencing results: Observer W-4419, four Immortals 1620-1640, match to 280 BC Alexandria description. Methos barely reacts. "Observers are trained to notice movement patterns." Joe: "They're trained to notice everything." 45 seconds. | Tag | Character |
| C6 | Tag: Carter/Casey — silence cracks. Private, late night. Carter tells Casey the emotional-state correlation. "It responds to him. Not just biologically. Emotionally." Casey: "Who else knows?" Carter: "Nobody. You. Now." Casey: "Then who do we tell?" The conspiracy deepens and cracks simultaneously. 60 seconds. | Tag | Threads |
| 17 | Tag: O'Neill at a terminal. Carter finds him writing STML. "You're writing STML." / "Organized information wins wars." His dossier includes security operations, temporal anomalies. "A filing system. For things that keep me awake." | Tag | Character |
| G2 | Joe/Marcus bar scouting. Vacant taberna near Forum. "A bar. A place where people sit and talk." Marcus: "I want to help you build a *good* bar." Seeds 1x13. 30 seconds. | (Tag or Act 3-4 transition) | Threads |
| 18 | Stinger: Kirk's INSTRUMENTA. Wall-tree from 1x09 still there, plus new layer. FRAGMENTUM cards: MacLeod, Casey, Methos (almost blank — one unverified 280 BC reference). Aide: MacLeod background check — same face, three passports, different decades. Capture protocol on laptop: references, not data. "If they find our files, they find references." 10/31. INSTRUMENTA. "Fragments, not profiles. References, not copies. You can't destroy what you don't possess." Looks at the almost-blank Methos card. "Who are you?" SMASH TO BLACK. | Stinger | Threads |

## D. WHAT TO INCLUDE FROM EACH PITCH

### From the A-Plot Writer:
**KEEP:**
- The complete act structure (backbone)
- Cold open: Daniel's self-description failure (brilliant — the language can't contain itself)
- ALL on-screen code moments (14 moments — essential)
- Raw content tag demonstration with `!` suffix (Act 1)
- Fragment grouping and named fragments (Act 2)
- Labels with namespaces (Act 2)
- Forward/backward/sandwich capture operators (Act 3)
- Capture guardrails and STML_ERROR_CAPTIO (Act 3)
- Transclusion demonstration (Act 4)
- Deep clone and shallow clone (Act 4)
- Dependency story — no new dependencies (Act 4)
- Full convergence document (Act 5)
- Title moment — Lucia at the board (Act 5)
- Tag: Daniel's manual + Pliny's variant edition
- Feature-to-dramatic-moment map
- The complete API reference (for beat sheet appendix)

**CUT:**
- Beat 12 dependency scene and Beat 13 convergence can be compressed into a single convergence beat
- Some on-screen code detail (trim from 14 to ~10 displayed moments — several are redundant)

### From the Character Writer:
**KEEP:**
- Lucia's realism insight — both fragment and label versions (compiled into one Beat 6 scene)
- Daniel's "transclusio" coinage with Lucia validation ("You didn't translate. You created.")
- Carter/Marcus deep clone collaboration + "We are both" line
- O'Neill's private dossier scene ("A filing system. For things that keep me awake.")
- Data's fragment meditation ("The fragment exists. That is sufficient.")
- Joe/Methos post-reunion scene with cross-reference results
- Daniel/Lucia professional collaboration (simmering, not escalating)
- Midas Cybele walk-through ("the voice that walks")
- Casey faith REST (rosary visible, no dialogue)
- No flashback (rhythm supports flashback-free)
- Ensemble beat table (for direction reference)
- Performance notes (especially Lucia's authority, O'Neill's competence surprise, Data's lengthening pauses)

**CUT:**
- Extended O'Neill STML markup display (trim to visual, not full code reading)
- Two-part Lucia insight (compile into one scene)
- Extended Pliny fragment demonstration with variant editions (Pliny gets Tag instead)

### From the Threads Writer:
**KEEP:**
- Casey faith REST: rosary beside keyboard, 3-second visual (specific and evocative)
- Kirk stinger: INSTRUMENTA, FRAGMENTUM cards, capture-as-reference protocol, Methos trace
- Carter/Casey temporal revelation: silence cracks, emotional-state correlation, "Who do we tell?"
- Gilfoyle/Dinesh introduction: two-scene structure (O'Neill flags → G&D office)
- Daniel investigation: "unum corpus, una mens" phrase planted
- Bar scouting: Joe/Marcus, vacant taberna, seeds 1x13
- Methos "the fragment is the raw data" observation (embed in A-plot teaching scene)
- Data/Midas "Your memories have patterns" scene
- Lucia's Procrustean critique (fold into Beat 6)
- Thread status appendix (include at end of beat sheet)
- Thread intersection map
- All backward/forward connection notes

**CUT:**
- Daniel/Lucia "inclusio remota" scene as the WINNING term (transclusio must survive; include the debate but Daniel wins)
- Joe/Pliny working session (implied through Joe/Methos scene data)
- Midas Lydian fragment anecdote (replaced with Cybele oracle)
- Extended O'Neill temporal file beat (folded into dossier)
- Carter/Casey scene at 75 seconds (trim to 60)

### From the Genre Fan:
**KEEP:**
- Three-voice: Lucia/Carter/Data — grammar/power/classification
- Lucia's Latin-grammar framework for extensions (cases = features)
- Carter's dual-use reflection ("Every tool has a dual use")
- Data's relaxed-constraints speech
- Tonal boundary rule for G&D scenes (production note)
- STML-to-franchise resonance map (for series bible)
- Kirk stinger as GRAMMATICA → INSTRUMENTA comparison (thematic note)
- Gilfoyle = raw content, Dinesh = transclusion (thematic note)
- The passive-to-active-grammar conceptual framework ("nouns to verbs")
- Daniel's inflection insight: capture operators = Latin case endings (excellent, keep in Beat 8)

**CUT:**
- Kirk stinger word GRAMMATICA (replaced with INSTRUMENTA)
- Full franchise-by-franchise breakdown (for series bible, not beat sheet)
- Extended sandwich capture Stargate parallel (too many resonances in one beat)
- The Highlander Quickening=assimilation observation (for series bible)
- Seldon's Vault / Second Foundation parallels (too deep)

### From the Historian:
**KEEP:**
- *Verba certa* / *ipsissima verba* parallel for raw content (brief reference in Beat 1-2)
- *Adrogatio* parallel for capture operators (brief reference in Beat 9)
- *Excerpta* / *florilegia* parallel for fragments (brief reference in Beat 4)
- *Tria nomina* / *cursus honorum* parallel for labels (Marcus demonstrates in Beat 5)
- *Cento* poetry parallel for transclusion (Daniel reference in Beat 10 area)
- *Exemplum* / *apographum* parallel for deep clone (brief in Beat 11)
- Latin vocabulary audit (complete glossary for continuity)
- Character knowledge map (who knows what)
- Production design notes: layers of notation in Tabularium, stemmata on walls, Pliny's adversaria visible
- Terms to AVOID list (especially *nomen* and *copia*)
- *Farcimen* as wonderfully earthy Latin (already in API)
- Marcus/Lucia dictator parallel for capture ("A dictator was a legal office with defined powers and duration. So is a capture operator.") — excellent, include in Beat 9 if time

**CUT:**
- Full historical accuracy section (for series bible)
- Extended *publicani* parallel for G&D (interesting but the scene speaks for itself)
- Cento performance (too much screen time for a parallel)
- Extended production design notes (for production bible)

## E. ELEMENTS TO DEFER

### Defer to Later Episodes:
- **Data's extended fragment meditation** ("The fragment exists. That is sufficient.") — include a compressed version in the A-plot but save the "Measure of a Man" extension for 1x11-12 when Data is spotlighted
- **Lucia's label taxonomy becoming formal standard** — seeds for 1x11-13 but don't over-commit in 1x10
- **Daniel/Lucia escalation** — simmer only. Save for 1x11-12 crisis pressure
- **O'Neill confronting Carter about temporal data** — 1x11-12
- **Pliny's "six more questions"** continuing — 1x14-16

### Defer to Series Bible / Thematic Notes:
- Full franchise-by-franchise analysis (genre fan)
- Gilfoyle/Dinesh as STML security model (genre fan — thematic notes)
- The Quickening as assimilation parallel (genre fan)
- Extended Roman legal parallels (historian)
- The cento poetry tradition in detail (historian)
- Kirk's operation mapped to every STML extension (threads — thematic notes)

## F. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

### 1. Cold Open Speaker — Daniel or Pliny?

The A-plot writer opens with Daniel trying to write the STML manual. Pliny arrives and sees the problem. This is clean and thematic (Daniel's arc bookends the episode). The character writer doesn't propose an alternative cold open.

**My recommendation:** Use the A-plot cold open as written. Daniel's frustration is the engine. Pliny's "An encyclopedia must be able to contain any subject — including itself" is the thesis. Carter's "Then we extend the language" is the promise. 75 seconds. Three people. The problem is devastating and the solution is the episode.

### 2. Data's Fragment Meditation — Full Scene or Embedded?

The character writer gives Data a full meditation on fragments and identity: "The fragment exists. That is sufficient." This is beautiful but adds 60-90 seconds to an already dense episode. The three-voice already has Data's formal contribution.

**My recommendation:** COMPRESS to 20 seconds embedded in the fragment teaching scene (Beat 4-5 area). Data says: "A fragment has no semantic identity. It exists in the tree but contributes no meaning — only structure. I find this construct... recognizable." Casey: "Recognizable how?" Data: "Contribution without identity markers is still contribution. The fragment exists. That is sufficient." Done. The longer meditation (Maddox, reorganization) is deferred to the three-voice and to later episodes.

### 3. Methos in 1x10 — How Much?

The historian recommends ONE beat, 15-20 seconds (evocatio parallel for capture operators). The character writer's Joe/Methos scene is 45-60 seconds. The threads writer has Methos "at the table" with a 20-30 second observation about fragments ("The fragment is the raw data").

**My recommendation:** TWO Methos beats, totaling ~70 seconds. (1) The threads writer's "fragment is the raw data" observation embedded in an A-plot teaching scene (20 seconds). (2) The character writer's Joe/Methos cross-reference scene in the Tag (45 seconds). Cut the historian's evocatio beat — three Methos appearances is too many for an episode where he's not spotlighted.

### 4. Episode Running Time / Density Concern

This episode is DENSE. Six new features, each needing demonstration. Gilfoyle/Dinesh introduction. Multiple C-plot beats. Three-voice. Kirk stinger. The risk is that it feels rushed.

**My recommendation:** The A-plot features pair naturally: Raw Content (Act 1, 3 beats) → Fragments+Labels (Act 2, 3 beats) → Captures (Act 3, 3 beats) → Transclusion+Clone (Act 4, 3 beats) → Convergence (Act 5, 2 beats). This is 14 A-plot beats + 6-7 C-plot beats + stinger ≈ 22 beats. Dense but manageable if C-plot beats stay SHORT (20-60 seconds each). The episode's thematic unity (extensions = grammar = verbs for the tree) keeps the density from feeling scattered.

### 5. Lucia/Carter Three-Voice vs. Lucia/Marcus — Final Call?

I've recommended Lucia/Carter/Data. But the character writer's case for Lucia/Marcus/Data has merit — Marcus enters the three-voice for the first time, providing the engineering lens. Carter hasn't been in the three-voice before either, but her dual-use reflection ties directly to the Midas secret she's carrying.

**My recommendation:** Lucia/Carter/Data. Carter's dual-use speech ("Powerful tools require honest hands") does double duty: it's a formal observation about the extensions AND a personal confession about the tools she's using to track Midas. The three-voice is more dramatically loaded with Carter than Marcus. Save Marcus's three-voice entry for a later episode (1x11-12 or 1x14) where engineering is the spotlight.
