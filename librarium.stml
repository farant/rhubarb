    <summarium>The Memorabilia is one of the primary sources for understanding the historical Socrates, written by his student Xenophon. It consists of four books that record conversations and actions of Socrates, aiming to defend him against the charges that led to his execution and to portray him as a model of virtue and wisdom. Unlike Plato's more philosophical dialogues, Xenophon's account focuses on Socrates as a practical moral teacher concerned with everyday ethics and civic virtue. The work provides valuable insight into Socratic teaching methods and 4th century BCE Athenian society.
</summarium>
    <notae>Dating ancient works is complex. Xenophon lived 431-354 BCE. The Memorabilia was likely composed sometime between 385-375 BCE, after Socrates' death in 399 BCE and during Xenophon's exile. I've chosen approximately -371 BCE as a middle estimate for the composition date, representing when the work itself was written rather than the events it describes. The negative year notation follows historical convention (BCE). This translation by H.G. Dakyns was published by Macmillan in 1897.

    <summarium>Livy's Ab Urbe Condita (History of Rome from its Foundation) is one of the monumental works of Roman historiography. Books IX-XXVI cover the period of the Samnite Wars, the Pyrrhic War, and the Second Punic War (roughly 321-201 BC). This section includes famous episodes like the disaster at the Caudine Forks, Rome's gradual expansion through Italy, and the existential struggle against Hannibal. Livy wrote in a grand, rhetorical style that aimed to celebrate Roman virtues and provide moral exempla for his contemporaries. The work blends historical fact with legend and moralistic interpretation.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen as circa 27 BC, representing the approximate beginning of Livy's composition of Ab Urbe Condita during the Augustan age. The complete work originally consisted of 142 books, of which only 35 survive (including Books IX-XXVI). This translation by Spillan and Edmonds is a 19th-century English rendering. Not tagged as &quot;appropriate-for-children&quot; due to detailed descriptions of warfare and political intrigue, though the moral tone was intended for educational purposes.

    <summarium>This work contains selected discourses (lectures and conversations) of Epictetus along with the Encheiridion (meaning 'Manual' or 'Handbook'), which is a brief compendium of Stoic ethical advice. Epictetus (c. 50-135 AD) was a Greek Stoic philosopher who was born a slave in Hierapolis, Phrygia. He studied under Musonius Rufus and eventually gained his freedom. After being exiled from Rome by Emperor Domitian around 93 AD, he established a philosophical school in Nicopolis in northwestern Greece. Epictetus wrote nothing himself; his teachings were recorded by his student Arrian. The Discourses represent his philosophical teachings on ethics, logic, and how to live a good life according to Stoic principles, emphasizing what is within our control versus what is not. The Encheiridion is a shorter, more practical handbook derived from the Discourses. This translation by George Long (1800-1879) was one of the most popular English versions in the 19th century.
</summarium>
    <notae>Dating Epictetus' works is challenging since he wrote nothing himself. The Discourses and Encheiridion were compiled by his student Arrian sometime between 108-125 AD. I've chosen 108 AD as a reasonable middle estimate for when Arrian likely began compiling these teachings, though the actual lectures would have been delivered over many years. Some scholars prefer dating it closer to 125 AD. The philosophical content reflects teachings from Epictetus' school in Nicopolis after his exile from Rome (c. 93 AD). This particular translation by George Long was published in the 19th century.

    <summarium>This is the fourth volume of Cassius Dio's Roman History, covering Books 52-60, which chronicle Roman history from 29 BC to 54 AD. This period includes the consolidation of Augustus's power, the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius. Cassius Dio (c. 155-235 AD) was a Roman statesman and historian who wrote his monumental 80-book history of Rome in Greek. This English translation was produced by Herbert Baldwin Foster and published in 1905. Dio's work is one of the most important sources for understanding the early Roman Empire, particularly the Julio-Claudian dynasty.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 220 represents approximately when Cassius Dio completed this portion of his history during the Severan dynasty, as indicated in the title page. While the Foster translation was published in 1905, the historical value lies in Dio's original composition in the early 3rd century AD. Dio wrote during the reigns of Septimius Severus through Alexander Severus (as noted on the title page), making his work a near-contemporary source for the Severan period and a later historical account of the Julio-Claudian era he describes in these books.

    <summarium>Cassius Dio's Roman History is a monumental 80-book work covering Roman history from the legendary founding of Rome to 229 CE. Written in Greek during the reigns of Septimius Severus through Alexander Severus (roughly 211-229 CE), it is one of the most important surviving sources for Roman imperial history. This third volume (translated by Herbert Baldwin Foster in 1906) covers Books 45-51, spanning the critical period from 44 BCE to 29 BCE - including the aftermath of Julius Caesar's assassination, the formation and dissolution of the Second Triumvirate, the civil wars between Octavian and Mark Antony, and the Battle of Actium. Dio was a Roman senator and consul who had access to official records and wrote from an insider's perspective on Roman politics and governance.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose circa 220 CE as the year because this represents approximately when Dio was actively composing this work (he wrote over a period spanning roughly 200-220+ CE). The translated edition shown is from 1906, but since you asked for the year most historically accurate to the original work itself, the early 3rd century CE date is most appropriate. This is a primary historical source, not a later commentary or annotated edition.

    <summarium>Śakuntalā (also transliterated as Shakuntala) is the most famous Sanskrit drama by the ancient Indian poet Kālidāsa. It tells the story of Shakuntala, a forest-dwelling maiden who falls in love with King Dushyanta. After they marry in secret, the king returns to his kingdom promising to send for her. However, due to a curse, he forgets her entirely when she arrives at court. The &quot;lost ring&quot; of the title is the token of their marriage that eventually restores his memory. The play is considered one of the masterpieces of world literature and was instrumental in introducing Indian classical drama to the West. This translation by Sir Monier Monier-Williams was first published in 1855 and went through multiple editions, becoming one of the most influential English versions of the work.
</summarium>
    <notae>Kālidāsa's dates are uncertain, but scholarly consensus generally places him in the 4th-5th century CE (around 400 CE is a common estimate). The exact composition date of Śakuntalā is unknown, but this approximate date reflects when the work was likely written. This is significantly earlier than this particular translation (1855), but since the request is for when the work was originally authored rather than when this edition was published, I've chosen the historical composition date. The play has been translated numerous times since being introduced to Europe by Sir William Jones in 1789.

    <summarium>The Nibelungenlied is a Middle High German epic poem written around 1200 AD by an unknown author. It is one of the most important works of German medieval literature and tells the story of the dragon-slayer Siegfried, his marriage to Kriemhild, his murder by Hagen, and Kriemhild's revenge. The epic combines elements from Germanic heroic legend (particularly the Burgundian kings and Attila the Hun) with courtly medieval culture. It has been enormously influential in German culture and was a major source for Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle. The poem consists of 39 adventures (chapters) written in stanzas of four lines each. This translation by Daniel B. Shumway was published in 1909.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose circa 1200 AD as the year because this represents when the poem was originally composed in Middle High German, which is the most historically significant date for this work. While the exact date is uncertain (estimates range from approximately 1180-1210), around 1200 is the scholarly consensus. This is more meaningful than using 1909 (the publication year of this particular English translation). The work itself is the literary product of that medieval period and should be dated accordingly. The Nibelungenlied is not a work of fiction in the modern sense but rather a medieval epic that reworks older Germanic legends into the courtly culture of around 1200 AD, hence the 'historical-document' tag.

    <summarium>Purgatorio is the second part of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, following Inferno and preceding Paradiso. Written in the early 14th century, it describes Dante's journey through Purgatory, the mountain where souls are purified before ascending to Heaven. This is a Finnish translation by Eino Leino (first published 1913). The work is a cornerstone of Catholic literature and Western civilization, depicting the seven terraces of Purgatory corresponding to the seven deadly sins. Dante's epic poem combines theology, philosophy, politics, and personal reflection in terza rima verse form. It is one of the greatest works of world literature and a profound meditation on sin, redemption, and divine grace.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1320 represents approximately when Dante completed Purgatorio (he began the Divine Comedy around 1308 and finished it shortly before his death in 1321). Some scholars date Purgatorio's completion to 1319-1320. Since this is the original composition date and the work is fundamentally Dante's despite being in translation, this date is most historically appropriate for a timeline of important works. The Finnish translation by Eino Leino was published in 1913, but the work itself dates to the medieval period.

    <summarium>Paradiso is the third and final part of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, following Inferno and Purgatorio. In this canticle, Dante the pilgrim ascends through the nine celestial spheres of Heaven, guided by Beatrice, his idealized beloved who represents divine love and theology. The work culminates in a mystical vision of God. Paradiso is considered one of the greatest works of world literature and a supreme achievement of medieval Catholic theology and poetry. Through elaborate allegorical structure and sublime poetry, Dante explores themes of divine justice, the beatific vision, free will, and the hierarchical nature of the cosmos according to medieval Christian cosmology. The work profoundly influenced Western literature and thought, synthesizing Classical philosophy (especially Aristotle and Aquinas) with Christian doctrine.
</summarium>
    <notae>The Divine Comedy was written between approximately 1308-1320. Paradiso, being the final part, was completed near the end of this period, likely around 1320, shortly before Dante's death in 1321. The exact composition dates are debated by scholars, but 1320 represents a reasonable approximation for when Paradiso was completed. The work as a whole is written in Italian vernacular rather than Latin, which was revolutionary for its time, making profound theological and philosophical content accessible beyond the learned elite.

    <summarium>Le Morte d'Arthur is the most comprehensive and influential collection of Arthurian legends in English literature. Written by Sir Thomas Malory during his imprisonment in the 1460s-1470s, it synthesizes French and English sources into a unified narrative of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, the quest for the Holy Grail, and the fall of Camelot. The work combines chivalric romance with Christian themes, exploring ideals of knighthood, loyalty, courtly love, and spiritual questing. It served as the primary source for most subsequent retellings of Arthurian legend in English.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1485 as the year because that's when William Caxton published the work, which is the traditional date associated with Le Morte d'Arthur. Malory likely completed the manuscript around 1469-1470, but it wasn't available to the public until Caxton's printing. The 1485 date is the most historically significant and commonly referenced. The work is tagged as 'catholic' because Malory was writing in pre-Reformation England, and the text is deeply infused with medieval Catholic spirituality, particularly in the Grail quest narrative.

    <summarium>This is William Tyndale's pioneering English translation of the Pentateuch (first five books of the Old Testament) and the New Testament, translated directly from Hebrew and Greek sources rather than from the Latin Vulgate. Tyndale's work was revolutionary for making Scripture accessible to English-speaking common people and profoundly influenced all subsequent English Bible translations, including the King James Version. His translation work was considered heretical by Catholic authorities at the time, and Tyndale was eventually executed for his efforts in 1536. This particular edition modernizes the spelling while preserving Tyndale's original wording, with some variant readings noted from Coverdale (1535) and Matthew's Bible (1537).
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen as 1530 when Tyndale's Pentateuch was first published, representing the completion of his Old Testament work featured here. His New Testament was published earlier (1526).

Unlike 'The Prince' which focuses on autocratic rule, the Discourses examines republican government and civic virtue, using Roman history as a lens to analyze political liberty, military organization, and the role of conflict in healthy republics. Machiavelli argues that republics are superior to principalities and examines how Rome's political institutions, including the tension between patricians and plebeians, contributed to its success. This work profoundly influenced republican thought and constitutional theory in subsequent centuries.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1531 represents the first publication date (posthumous). The work was composed between approximately 1513-1517 but not published until after Machiavelli's death in 1527.

    <summarium>Troilus and Cressida is one of William Shakespeare's problem plays, set during the Trojan War. The play interweaves two storylines: the tragic love affair between the Trojan prince Troilus and Cressida, and the Greek siege of Troy, featuring famous warriors like Achilles, Ajax, and Hector. The work is notable for its cynical tone, questioning traditional heroic values and romantic ideals. It explores themes of honor, betrayal, time's destructive power, and the gap between reputation and reality. The play presents war as futile and love as unstable, making it one of Shakespeare's most philosophically complex and tonally ambiguous works.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact date of composition is debated, but most scholars place it between 1601-1603. The First Folio was published in 1623, but there was an earlier quarto edition in 1609. I've chosen 1602 as a reasonable middle estimate for when the play was likely written and first performed. This text appears to be from an early printing, likely the First Folio given the distinctive typography and spelling conventions (long 's', 'ſ' characters, etc.). The play was not categorized as 'appropriate-for-children' due to its mature themes and cynical treatment of love and war. It is not tagged as 'catholic' as Shakespeare's religious affiliations remain historically ambiguous and this work does not have explicitly Catholic themes.

It contains some of the most famous lines in English literature, including &quot;To be or not to be&quot; and features iconic scenes like the ghost of Hamlet's father and the play-within-a-play.

Given that this Gutenberg text preserves early printing conventions and spellings, 1603 captures the historical moment when this version of the text emerged.

    <summarium>This is the First Quarto edition of Hamlet, one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies. The play tells the story of Prince Hamlet of Denmark, who seeks revenge against his uncle Claudius for murdering his father, marrying his mother, and seizing the throne. The First Quarto (Q1) was published in 1603 and is notably different from the more familiar Second Quarto (1604) and First Folio (1623) versions. This early printing contains numerous variations in spelling, punctuation, and even text that reflect the printing practices of the time, including the use of 'u' for 'v' and vice versa, and other typographical substitutions that occurred when printers ran out of certain characters in their type cases.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1603 represents the publication of the First Quarto, which is the earliest printed version of Hamlet. The actual composition date is believed to be around 1599-1601, but for a historical timeline, the 1603 publication date of Q1 is the most concrete documentary evidence. The text preserves the original printing conventions and &quot;errors&quot; that are now considered part of the historical record of early modern printing practices.

    <summarium>The Faithful Shepherdess is a pastoral tragicomedy written primarily by John Fletcher (though traditionally attributed to both Beaumont and Fletcher). It is one of the earliest English pastoral dramas, telling the story of Clorin, a shepherdess who has vowed chastity and lives by her lover's grave, practicing herbalism and healing. The play explores themes of chastity, love, desire, and virtue through various shepherds and shepherdesses in an idyllic Thessalian setting. The work was innovative in its use of the pastoral mode for English drama and influenced later works in the genre. It features Fletcher's characteristic lyrical verse and explores the tension between natural desire and virtuous restraint.
</summarium>
    <notae>The play was first performed around 1608-1609 and published in 1609. While traditionally part of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon, modern scholarship attributes this work primarily or entirely to Fletcher alone. The play initially failed with audiences who expected a typical comedy, but it later gained appreciation and influenced pastoral literature. I've chosen 1609 as it represents both the approximate composition date and first publication.

    <summarium>Sonnet 40 is one of William Shakespeare's 154 sonnets, part of the Fair Youth sequence (sonnets 1-126). This particular sonnet deals with themes of betrayal, love, and forgiveness. The speaker addresses a young man who has taken the speaker's mistress, expressing both hurt and a willingness to forgive. It's part of a sub-group (sonnets 40-42) that deal with a romantic triangle involving the speaker, the fair youth, and the speaker's mistress. The sonnet demonstrates Shakespeare's mastery of the English sonnet form with its characteristic three quatrains and a concluding couplet.
</summarium>
    <notae>The sonnets were first published in 1609 by Thomas Thorpe, though they were likely written over a period of years in the 1590s-1600s. I've chosen 1609 as the publication year since that's the standard historical reference point for Shakespeare's sonnets as a complete collection.

    <summarium>'The History of Tom Thumb' is one of the oldest English fairy tales, first published as a prose chapbook in 1621 under the title 'The History of Tom Thumbe.' The story features the legendary tiny hero Tom Thumb, supposedly born no bigger than his father's thumb through the intervention of Merlin the magician and the Queen of the Fairies during King Arthur's reign. This collection appears to be a late 19th or early 20th century republication by M.A. Donohue &amp; Co. (a Chicago publisher active from 1890s-1940s) that includes multiple traditional tales. Tom Thumb became an archetypal character in English folklore and has been retold countless times. The tale combines Arthurian legend with fairy tale elements and follows the adventures of the diminutive hero.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1621 as the year because this represents the first known printed publication of 'Tom Thumb' as a prose tale, which is the most historically significant date for this work in English literary history. While the oral tradition likely predates this, and this Gutenberg edition is clearly a much later (c. 1900-1920) illustrated children's edition by Donohue, the 1621 date best represents when this story entered the documented literary canon. The work is not attributed to a single author as it emerged from oral folklore tradition before being transcribed.

    <summarium>'The First Part of Henry the Sixth' (often written as 'Henry VI, Part 1') is a history play by William Shakespeare that dramatizes events during the early reign of King Henry VI of England and the early stages of the Hundred Years' War with France. The play focuses on the loss of English territories in France, the rivalry between the Duke of Gloucester and the Bishop of Winchester, and the rise of Joan of Arc (depicted as 'Joan la Pucelle'). It also introduces the conflict between the houses of York and Lancaster that would later erupt into the Wars of the Roses. The play is notable for its depiction of English military hero John Talbot and the political machinations at the English court. This appears to be from the First Folio edition based on the Executive Director's notes about original printing conventions.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1623 represents the First Folio publication, which is the first collected edition of Shakespeare's plays and the primary source text for Henry VI Part 1. While the play was likely written and performed in the early 1590s (possibly 1591-1592), the 1623 First Folio is the most historically significant edition as it's our earliest printed source. The Executive Director's notes about printing conventions (cliches, u/v substitutions, etc.) confirm this is reproduced from First Folio typography. The historical events depicted in the play occurred in the 1420s-1430s, but for a timeline of literary works, 1623 represents the definitive publication date.

    <summarium>Robinson Crusoe is one of the first and most famous English novels, telling the story of a man shipwrecked on a remote island who must survive using his ingenuity and resourcefulness. The novel chronicles Crusoe's twenty-eight years of isolation, his struggles with loneliness, his relationship with Friday (a native he rescues), and his ultimate return to civilization. Written in the form of an autobiography, it has become a foundational work of English literature and a defining example of the adventure novel genre. The book explores themes of survival, providence, colonialism, and the relationship between civilization and nature.
</summarium>
    <notae>Robinson Crusoe was first published in 1719, though this Project Gutenberg text appears to be from an 1808 London edition. I've chosen 1719 as the year since that represents the original publication and historical significance of the work. The novel was immediately popular and has remained continuously in print for over 300 years. While Defoe was raised as a Puritan dissenter (Protestant nonconformist), the work itself is adventure fiction rather than explicitly Catholic literature, so I have not included the 'catholic' tag.

    <summarium>This is a selection of comedies by Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux (1688-1763), one of the most important French playwrights of the 18th century. Marivaux wrote approximately 40 plays, primarily sophisticated romantic comedies known for their witty dialogue and psychological insight into love and social relationships. His works are characterized by what became known as &quot;marivaudage&quot; - a subtle, refined style of conversation and flirtation. His most famous plays include &quot;Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard&quot; (The Game of Love and Chance) and &quot;Les Fausses Confidences&quot; (False Confidences). This edition was edited by Everett Ward Olmsted for educational purposes, containing both French text and English notes.
</summarium>
    <notae>Marivaux wrote his comedies primarily between 1720-1740, with his most productive period in the 1730s. Since this is a selection of his works rather than a single play, I've chosen 1730 as a representative midpoint of his theatrical career when he was at his peak. This edition was published in 1901 by Macmillan for English-speaking students learning French, but the works themselves date to the early-to-mid 18th century.

    <summarium>The &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; is the culminating movement of Part II of George Frideric Handel's sacred oratorio &quot;Messiah.&quot; First performed in Dublin in 1742, it is one of the most famous and recognizable pieces of choral music in Western classical tradition. The text is taken from the Book of Revelation and other biblical passages, celebrating Christ's triumph and eternal reign. The piece is known for its majestic grandeur and the tradition (possibly apocryphal) that King George II stood during its first London performance, establishing the custom of audiences rising during its performance. This Project Gutenberg entry is an audio recording from the Edison National Historic Site, representing an early phonograph recording of this iconic work.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1742 represents the premiere of Handel's &quot;Messiah&quot; in Dublin on April 13, 1742. While this Gutenberg entry is actually an audio recording (likely early 20th century from Edison's collection), the work itself dates to 1742. Handel was Anglican, but &quot;Messiah&quot; is universally embraced across Christian denominations and is thoroughly biblical in content, making it appropriate for Catholic contexts. The work is entirely suitable for all ages and is regularly performed in churches and concert halls worldwide.

    <summarium>'Clarissa' is Samuel Richardson's monumental epistolary novel, told entirely through letters between the characters. It chronicles the tragic story of Clarissa Harlowe, a virtuous young woman from a wealthy family who is pursued by the rake Robert Lovelace. The novel explores themes of virtue, sexuality, individual autonomy versus family authority, and the position of women in 18th-century society. After Clarissa refuses an arranged marriage and is subsequently abducted and violated by Lovelace, the narrative follows her moral and physical decline despite Lovelace's offers of marriage. The work is considered one of the most important novels in the English language and a foundational text of the novel form itself. Richardson, a printer by trade, created this work partly as a moral instruction, though its psychological complexity transcends simple didacticism.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was originally published in multiple installments between December 1747 and December 1748. I've chosen 1748 as it represents the completion of the first edition. Richardson later revised it substantially. While Richardson was Protestant (Anglican/Church of England), not Catholic, the novel does engage deeply with Christian themes of virtue, repentance, and redemption. It was widely read across denominational lines and influenced Catholic as well as Protestant moral literature. The work is decidedly not appropriate for children due to its subject matter involving abduction and sexual violation, even though these are handled with 18th-century discretion.

    <summarium>This is an edited collection of trial records from the infamous murder trial of Mary Blandy, who was tried and executed in 1752 for poisoning her father with arsenic. The case was one of the most sensational criminal trials of 18th-century England. Mary Blandy, a gentlewoman from Henley-on-Thames, was convicted of murdering her father, Francis Blandy, allegedly at the instigation of her lover, Captain William Henry Cranstoun, who provided her with the poison disguised as a &quot;love powder.&quot; The trial attracted enormous public attention and became a landmark case in English criminal law. William Roughead was a notable Scottish lawyer and crime historian who edited this collection of trial documents in the early 20th century.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year given (1752) refers to the original trial date, as this is the historically significant event being documented. William Roughead's editorial work was published much later (likely early 1900s as part of the Notable British Trials series), but the primary historical value and content of the work centers on the 1752 trial itself. This approach aligns with your stated preference for choosing the year that is most historically accurate and educational for timeline purposes.

    <summarium>This is the fourth volume of a comprehensive biographical compendium of British and Irish poets, compiled by Colley Cibber (1671-1757), an English actor-manager, playwright, and Poet Laureate, along with other contributors. The work provides biographical sketches and critical assessments of poets from the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Volume IV includes lives of notable literary figures such as William Congreve, John Vanbrugh, Richard Steele, Matthew Prior, and Lord Lansdowne (George Granville), among others. This collection was an important early work of English literary biography and criticism, providing valuable historical context about the poets and their works during a formative period of English literature.

    <notae>The year 1753 is taken directly from the title page (MDCCLIII). While Cibber initiated this project, he died in 1757, and the work was continued and expanded by Robert Shiels and other contributors.

    <summarium>The Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon is Henry Fielding's final work, a deeply personal travel narrative written during his voyage to Portugal in 1754 while suffering from dropsy and other ailments. The renowned author of Tom Jones and Joseph Andrews documented his journey with characteristic wit, keen observation, and remarkable stoicism despite knowing his illness was likely fatal. Published posthumously in 1755, the work offers invaluable biographical insight into Fielding's character during his final months, revealing his affectionate concern for his family, his satirical yet kindly view of humanity, and his undiminished literary powers. It stands as both a touching human document and a fine example of 18th-century travel writing.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen is 1755, the year of posthumous publication, since this is when the work was actually completed and made available. Fielding died in Lisbon in October 1754, shortly after the events described in the journal. While technically written in 1754, the work exists as a complete entity only from its 1755 publication.

    <summarium>The Constitution of the United States of America is the supreme law of the United States, establishing the framework of the federal government and defining the relationship between the federal government and the states. Drafted at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, it was signed on September 17, 1787, and subsequently ratified by the states. The Constitution establishes three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial) with a system of checks and balances, and initially consisted of seven articles. This text is the original Constitution without the amendments (the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments were added later, beginning in 1791).
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1787 is the most historically accurate date as this is when the Constitution was written and signed at the Constitutional Convention (September 17, 1787). While ratification by the required nine states occurred in 1788 and it went into effect in 1789, the document itself is dated 1787 and this is the conventional historical date used. This text explicitly notes it does not include the amendments, which is consistent with the original 1787 document. The Constitution was not authored by a single individual but by the Constitutional Convention delegates, with significant contributions from James Madison (often called the &quot;Father of the Constitution&quot;), though it represents a collective work.

The play examines themes of artistic genius, social constraints, patronage, and the conflict between the idealistic poet and the pragmatic courtier Antonio. Set at Belriguardo, a pleasure palace of Duke Alphonso II d'Este, the drama portrays Tasso's psychological struggles and his relationships with the Duke, Princess Leonore d'Este, and Countess Leonore Sanvitale. Written in blank verse, it represents Goethe's classical period and is considered one of his most refined dramatic works, exploring the tension between artistic sensibility and worldly power.

James Boswell (1740-1795) met Samuel Johnson in 1763 and maintained a close friendship with the great English lexicographer, critic, and conversationalist until Johnson's death in 1784. Boswell meticulously recorded Johnson's conversations, habits, and opinions, creating an intimate and vivid portrait that revolutionized biographical writing. The work includes Boswell's famous Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides (1773) and provides invaluable insight into 18th-century literary London. This particular volume (VI) is from George Birkbeck Hill's scholarly edition published in 1887, which includes extensive annotations, addenda, and an index.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1791 - the original publication date of Boswell's Life of Johnson. While this excerpt is from Hill's 1887 scholarly edition (which became the standard scholarly text), for a historical timeline the 1791 date is most appropriate as it marks when this groundbreaking biography first appeared and transformed the genre.

    <summarium>This is one of the earliest known slave narratives published in America, written by Venture Smith (born Broteer Furro), who was captured in Africa at age six, brought to America as a slave at eight years old, and eventually purchased his own freedom and that of his family. The narrative details his life in bondage, his remarkable efforts to earn money and buy his freedom, and his subsequent life as a free man in Connecticut. Published in New London in 1798, this work predates the more famous narratives of Frederick Douglass and others by several decades, making it a crucial primary source document for understanding slavery in colonial and early American history.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1798 is the original publication date as stated on the title page. Venture Smith was born around 1729 in West Africa (in what is now Guinea) and died in 1805. This narrative is notable for being published during Smith's lifetime and is considered one of the first slave narratives in American literature. The work was dictated by Smith (who was likely literate but employed someone to write it down) and published when he was approximately 69 years old, after having lived as a free man for several decades.

    <summarium>A traditional British or American sea shanty about whaling expeditions to Greenland waters. The song describes the harsh conditions faced by whalers sailing to the Arctic, including frozen extremities and dangerous work hunting Greenland whales (likely bowhead whales). Like many work songs of the era, it balances the hardship of the voyage with the promise of celebration and ale-drinking upon return to London. Sea shanties were functional work songs sung aboard ships to coordinate labor and maintain morale during long, difficult voyages.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1800 is an approximation representing the height of Greenland whaling activity. Traditional folk songs have no single composition date - they evolved through oral tradition. British Arctic whaling peaked roughly 1750-1850. This song reflects the actual historical practice of whaling expeditions departing in March (as mentioned in the lyrics) to reach Arctic waters during the brief summer season. Classified as non-fiction/historical-document because it represents authentic working life and culture of whalers, though it is a song rather than prose narrative.

    <summarium>This is the third of Beethoven's six String Quartets that comprise his Opus 18, which are considered his first mature works in the string quartet genre. These quartets were composed between 1798-1800 and published in 1801, representing Beethoven's early period when he was still heavily influenced by Haydn and Mozart, though his distinctive voice was beginning to emerge. The Opus 18 quartets established Beethoven as a significant composer in the quartet form, a genre he would revolutionize in his later works. This particular quartet (No. 3 in D major) is known for its lyrical character and demonstrates Beethoven's growing mastery of four-part writing and thematic development.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1801 represents the publication date of the Opus 18 quartets, which is the most historically significant date for these works. While composition occurred 1798-1800, the publication date is when these works became publicly available and established Beethoven's reputation in the quartet genre. This is a musical score, not a text work, so tags like 'appropriate-for-children' or 'fiction/non-fiction' in the traditional literary sense don't quite apply - I've categorized it as 'non-fiction' in the sense that musical scores are instructional/performance documents rather than narrative works.

    <summarium>Bagh O Bahar (Garden and Spring) is a classical Hindustani prose work that has been a standard text for learning the Hindustani language since the early 19th century. Originally commissioned by Fort William College in Calcutta, Mir Amman adapted this work from earlier Persian tales, particularly the Qissa-e Chahar Darvesh. The work consists of romantic tales featuring four dervishes (wandering Muslim holy men) and displays Eastern manners, modes of thinking, and various idioms of the Hindustani language. The tales incorporate elements common to Oriental romance: jinn, demons, fairies, angels, and fabulous machinery that reflect Islamic beliefs and imagination. While primarily valued as a linguistic and cultural text, it contains entertaining narratives that illustrate the storytelling traditions of Mughal India.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1802 represents when Mir Amman completed this Hindustani version at Fort William College. This translation by Duncan Forbes is from 1874, but the historically significant date is Mir Amman's original composition. The work draws on much older Persian sources, but Mir Amman's Hindustani rendering is what became the celebrated classical text throughout British India. This text has been used for over 150 years as an introduction to Hindustani language and culture.

    <summarium>Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is one of the most famous and influential compositions in Western classical music. Known for its iconic four-note opening motif (often described as &quot;fate knocking at the door&quot;), the symphony represents a journey from darkness to light, from C minor to C major. Composed between 1804 and 1808, it premiered on December 22, 1808, at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna. The work is structured in four movements and exemplifies Beethoven's middle period, showcasing his innovative approach to symphonic form and his ability to develop a simple motif throughout an entire work. This Project Gutenberg edition contains MIDI files of the symphony rather than a text analysis or score.
</summarium>
    <notae>The symphony was composed over several years (1804-1808) but premiered and was published in 1808, which is the standard historical date used for this work. The premiere concert on December 22, 1808 was a marathon event that also included the premiere of the Sixth Symphony, among other works. This is a musical work in MIDI format rather than a literary text, so it's been tagged as a historical-document rather than fiction/non-fiction in the traditional sense.

    <summarium>Adolphe Thiers' 'Histoire de la Révolution française' is one of the most important and influential historical accounts of the French Revolution, written in the early 19th century. Originally published in ten volumes between 1823 and 1827, this work shaped historical understanding of the Revolution for generations. Volume III covers the period of the Convention Nationale beginning in September 1792, including the September Massacres, the trial and execution of Louis XVI, the establishment of the Republic, and the conflicts between the Girondins and Montagnards. Thiers, who would later become Prime Minister and President of France, wrote this as a young man and it established his reputation as both a historian and political thinker. The work is notable for its detailed narrative style and its attempt to provide a comprehensive account of the Revolution's political and social upheavals.
</summarium>
    <notae>The first volumes of Thiers' work began appearing in 1823, with the complete ten-volume set finished by 1827. Volume III would have been published around 1823-1824. This is not merely a translation but an original French historical work. Thiers was not Catholic and the work takes a liberal-constitutional perspective on the Revolution, so it does not receive a 'catholic' tag.

    <summarium>This is Adolphe Thiers' monumental multi-volume history of the French Revolution, one of the most influential historical works of the 19th century. This particular volume (Tome IX) covers the Directory period (Directoire) in the winter of Year V (1797), including the political situation, the characters and divisions among the five Directors (Barras, Carnot, Rewbell, Letourneur, and Larévellière-Lépaux), public opinion, royalist intrigues, and the military situation following victories at Rivoli and the capture of Mantua. Thiers' work was groundbreaking for its use of primary sources and its relatively sympathetic treatment of the revolutionary period. It established him as a major historian and political figure in France.
</summarium>
    <notae>The work was originally published between 1823-1827 in ten volumes. This appears to be from the ninth edition (neuvième édition), indicating its popularity and continued republication throughout the 19th century. I've chosen 1823 as the year since this represents the original publication date of this historical work, which is most appropriate for a historical timeline. While Thiers was raised Catholic, this is a secular historical work and would not be considered for nihil obstat/imprimatur, so I have not included the 'catholic' tag.

    <summarium>'O, Tannenbaum' (O Christmas Tree) is a traditional German Christmas carol. The melody is believed to have originated earlier, but the most well-known lyrics about the fir tree were written by Ernst Anschütz, a Leipzig teacher and organist, in 1824. The song celebrates the evergreen fir tree as a symbol of constancy and faithfulness. This Project Gutenberg entry is an audio recording performed by the Nebe Quartett, taken from the Edison National Historic Site, representing an early phonograph recording of this beloved carol.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1824 as the year because that's when Ernst Anschütz wrote the familiar lyrics we associate with 'O, Tannenbaum' today. While the melody existed earlier (possibly from a 16th-century Silesian folk song), and the song has evolved through various versions, 1824 represents the creation of the version that became the standard. This Gutenberg entry is actually an audio recording (mp3 format) rather than a text, which is unusual - it's a historical phonograph recording from the Edison collection, but for timeline purposes the composition date is most historically meaningful. Not marked as Catholic despite being a Christmas carol since it's a secular song about a Christmas tree rather than a liturgical or devotional work.

    <summarium>This is the tenth volume of Samuel Johnson's collected works, published in 1825. It contains Johnson's famous Parliamentary Debates, which he originally wrote for The Gentleman's Magazine between 1741-1744 under the fictional pretense of reporting debates from the &quot;Senate of Magna Lilliput&quot; (to avoid legal restrictions on reporting actual parliamentary proceedings). These debates cover important political matters of the early 1740s including military affairs, the War of Austrian Succession, and attempts to remove Prime Minister Robert Walpole. Johnson's parliamentary debates are considered significant works of 18th-century political prose, though they are literary recreations rather than verbatim transcripts. Johnson himself later acknowledged he &quot;took care that the Whig dogs should not have the best of it.&quot;
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1825 refers to this collected edition. The actual parliamentary debates contained within were originally written by Johnson between 1741-1744. I chose 1825 as it represents this specific published volume, though the content dates from the 1740s. Johnson was Anglican, not Catholic, so this does not receive a 'catholic' tag.

    <summarium>'The Spirit of the Age' is a collection of critical essays by William Hazlitt, one of the greatest English essayists and critics of the Romantic period. Published in 1825, the work contains character sketches and literary portraits of prominent intellectual figures of early 19th-century England. The essays examine philosophers, poets, writers, and thinkers including Jeremy Bentham, William Godwin, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, William Wordsworth, Walter Scott, and Thomas Malthus, among others. Hazlitt's penetrating observations combine biographical details with critical assessments of their work and influence on contemporary thought. The book is considered a masterpiece of biographical criticism and provides invaluable insight into the intellectual climate of the Romantic era.
</summarium>
    <notae>Published in 1825. This is Hazlitt's original publication date. While Hazlitt was not Catholic (he was raised as a Unitarian and became more secular), this work represents an important document of English literary criticism and would be suitable for general audiences interested in history and literature.

    <summarium>This is a collection of poems by Thomas Gent, a relatively obscure English poet 
of the early 19th century. The volume includes both previously published pieces 
that had been well-received individually, as well as many poems being printed 
for the first time. Gent describes himself as someone whose financial circumstances 
prevented him from devoting himself fully to poetry, making it merely 'the amusements 
of the leisure hours' rather than a full-time pursuit. The Advertisement reveals 
a touching personal note - during the printing of this collection, Gent suffered 
a severe domestic loss (likely the death of his wife), which he mentions with 
considerable emotion at the end of his preface.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1828 is clearly indicated as the publication date in London. This is an 
original work from that period, not a translation or reprint of earlier material. 
Thomas Gent was not a major literary figure, and little is known about him today. 
The work is not Catholic in nature - it appears to be secular English poetry from 
the Romantic era. The tag 'not-appropriate-for-children' is applied as a default 
for general poetry collections of this period, though the actual content may vary.

weekly periodical published in the 19th century. This particular issue is \
from Volume XIX, Number 532, dated Saturday, February 4, 1832, and sold \
for 2 pence. The magazine featured a mix of literary content, news, \
illustrations, cultural commentary, and educational material aimed at a \
general educated audience. This issue appears to focus on &quot;Robert the Devil&quot; \
(Robert le Diable), discussing the French opera and its popularity in Paris \
and anticipated adaptations in London theaters. The publication was designed \
to provide accessible entertainment and instruction to middle-class Victorian \
readers.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1832 is straightforward here as this is a periodical with a specific \
publication date clearly stated in the title: Saturday, February 4, 1832. \
This is not a timeless literary work but a dated magazine issue, so the \
original publication date is the relevant historical date.

    <summarium>The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction was a popular British weekly periodical published from 1822 to 1849. It contained a wide variety of content including essays on architecture, history, literature, natural history, biographical sketches, poetry, and illustrated engravings. This particular issue from December 15, 1832 features an article about the Chapel on the Bridge in Wakefield, Yorkshire, discussing the historical practice of building chapels on bridges dating back to Roman times. The publication was designed to provide educational and entertaining content to a general readership at an affordable price (2 pence per issue).
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1832 is clearly stated on the document as the publication date of this specific issue. The Mirror was a serial publication with multiple contributors rather than a single author, hence 'Various' as the author. This type of periodical was part of the Victorian era's push for popular education and self-improvement among the middle and working classes.

    <summarium>'The Message' (Le Message) is a short story by Honoré de Balzac, first published in 1832 as part of Scènes de la vie privée (Scenes of Private Life), later incorporated into his monumental La Comédie Humaine. The story is a tragic tale told by a narrator who recounts meeting a young man while traveling from Paris to Moulins in 1819. The story explores themes of love, duty, and the devastating consequences of chance events. It's a characteristic example of Balzac's ability to create psychological tension and explore the private emotional worlds of his characters. The frame narrative structure (a story within a story) was a device Balzac used effectively to create intimacy and authenticity.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen is 1832, when the story was first published. While Balzac wrote many works and revised extensively, this represents the first publication date. Translated by Ellen Marriage, who was one of the primary English translators of Balzac's work in the late 19th/early 20th century. Balzac himself was Catholic, but his fiction was often realistic and not specifically devotional, so I did not include the 'catholic' tag despite his personal faith.

    <summarium>'The Teacher' is one of Jacob Abbott's most influential educational works, presenting a systematic approach to classroom management and instruction based on moral influence rather than harsh discipline. Abbott (1803-1879) was a pioneering American educator, Congregationalist minister, and prolific author who founded the Mount Vernon School for Young Ladies in Boston. This book became a foundational text in teacher training and represented a progressive shift toward understanding child psychology and employing gentler, more rational methods of instruction. Abbott advocated for treating students with respect, appealing to their reason and conscience, and creating an organized system of school management. His educational philosophy influenced American pedagogy throughout the 19th century and helped professionalize the teaching occupation. Abbott is also famous for writing the Rollo books, a popular series of children's literature.
</summarium>
    <notae>The text shows this is a revised edition from 1873 (as stated on the title page), but the work was originally published in 1833. I chose 1833 as the Year because that represents the historical moment when Abbott's educational philosophy first entered the public discourse and began influencing American pedagogy. The 1873 edition represents a later revision, but the work's historical and educational significance dates to the original publication. The copyright notice shows 1856, which may represent another revised edition between the original and this 1873 printing.

    <summarium>This is a collection of poems by Alexander Pushkin, the great Russian poet often considered the founder of modern Russian literature, translated into English by George Borrow. The collection includes &quot;The Talisman,&quot; &quot;The Mermaid,&quot; &quot;Ancient Russian Song,&quot; &quot;Ancient Ballad,&quot; and &quot;The Renegade.&quot; Pushkin (1799-1837) was a Romantic poet whose work profoundly influenced Russian literature and culture. George Borrow (1803-1881) was an English author and polyglot known for his travel writings and linguistic abilities, who translated various works from multiple languages including Russian.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1835 is chosen as an approximate date for when these poems would have been originally written by Pushkin, during his most productive period. Pushkin's major works were published in the 1820s-1830s before his death in a duel in 1837. Borrow's translation was likely done in the mid-19th century. Since the primary author is Pushkin and this is a collection of his poetry, dating it to his creative period seems most historically appropriate for a timeline of literary works.

    <summarium>This is one of the most influential American child-rearing manuals of the 19th century, written by physician and reformer William Andrus Alcott. The work provides practical advice on managing children's health, covering topics from nursery arrangement and temperature control to ventilation, clothing, diet, and general childcare practices. Alcott was part of the health reform movement of his era and advocated for rational, scientific approaches to child-rearing rather than traditional folk practices. This third edition (1836) was enlarged with additional sections including guidance for mothers' own health and conduct. The book reflects the emerging professionalization of medicine and domestic science in antebellum America and was widely read by middle-class families seeking modern, enlightened approaches to child-rearing.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1836 represents this specific third edition as stated in the advertisement. Earlier editions would have been published slightly before this. Alcott was a prolific writer on health reform topics and cousin to Louisa May Alcott's father, Amos Bronson Alcott. While Alcott may have had Protestant religious influences, this work is primarily a secular health manual and does not qualify for the 'catholic' tag based on the criteria provided.

    <summarium>Los Amantes de Teruel is a romantic drama based on the famous medieval Spanish legend of the lovers of Teruel. The play tells the story of Isabel de Segura and Diego de Marcilla, whose love is thwarted by social circumstances. It is considered Hartzenbusch's masterpiece and one of the most important works of Spanish Romantic theater. The legend embodies themes of pure and constant love, loyalty, and tragic devotion.

    <summarium>&quot;Snarleyyow; or, The Dog Fiend&quot; is a nautical adventure novel by Captain Frederick Marryat, set in the late 17th century during the Glorious Revolution period. The story revolves around the misadventures of Lieutenant Vanslyperken, commander of the cutter Yungfrau, and his seemingly indestructible dog Snarleyyow, who survives numerous attempts on his life. The novel combines maritime adventure with dark comedy, featuring smugglers, conspirators, and various colorful characters in the waters between England and Holland. Marryat, a former Royal Navy captain, was known for his realistic depictions of naval life and his influence on later maritime fiction writers.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was first published in 1837. The date &quot;MDCCCXCV&quot; (1895) shown in this edition is likely a reprint date. Captain Marryat (1792-1848) wrote this as one of his many popular nautical novels following his successful naval career. While Marryat was a naval officer writing about maritime life, this is an adventure novel rather than a specifically Catholic work, despite Marryat being Anglican.

    <summarium>&quot;The Little Match Girl&quot; (Danish: &quot;Den Lille Pige med Svovlstikkerne&quot;) is one of Hans Christian Andersen's most famous and poignant fairy tales. It tells the story of a poor young girl who is trying to sell matches on a cold New Year's Eve. As she freezes in the winter cold, she lights her matches one by one to keep warm, and with each match she sees beautiful visions - a warm stove, a Christmas feast, a Christmas tree, and finally her deceased grandmother. The story is a powerful meditation on poverty, suffering, and death, characteristic of Andersen's deeper, more melancholic fairy tales. Despite being marketed as a children's story, it deals with serious themes of social inequality and human compassion.
</summarium>
    <notae>The story was first published in December 1845 in the fifth volume of &quot;Nye Eventyr&quot; (New Fairy Tales). Note that the author's name is spelled &quot;Andersen&quot; (not &quot;Anderson&quot; as it appears in the Gutenberg header - this is a common anglicization error). The 1845 date represents the original Danish publication, which is the most historically significant date for this work.

    <summarium>A historical novel by Giuseppe Rovani set during the period of French invasions of Italy and the conflicts involving the Sforza dynasty in Milan. The work is part of Rovani's series of historical novels depicting significant periods in Italian history. Rovani was a prominent 19th-century Milanese novelist and art critic known for his historical fiction that combined romantic storytelling with detailed historical research about Renaissance and early modern Italy. The novel dramatizes the political and military upheavals of late 15th and early 16th century Lombardy when French armies repeatedly invaded Italy and clashed with the ruling Sforza family of Milan.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact first publication date of this specific novel in Rovani's series is somewhat uncertain, but his major historical fiction works were published in the 1840s-1850s. The edition shown here is from 1877 (seconda edizione - second edition), published after Rovani's death in 1874. I've chosen 1845 as an approximate date for the original publication based on Rovani's active period of historical fiction writing. This is secular historical fiction by a 19th-century Italian author, not a Catholic devotional or theological work.

    <summarium>'The Devil's Pool' (original French title: 'La Mare au Diable') is a pastoral novel by George Sand, considered one of her most charming and accessible works. It tells the story of a widowed peasant farmer named Germain who is encouraged to remarry, and his journey with a young woman named Marie. Set in the rural Berry region of central France, the novel celebrates rustic life and simple virtues while exploring themes of love, grief, and community. The work is notable for its idealized yet sympathetic portrayal of French country life and peasant culture. George Sand (pen name of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin) was one of the most prominent French writers of the 19th century, known for her independent spirit and prolific literary output.
</summarium>
    <notae>'La Mare au Diable' was first published in 1846. This edition appears to be an English translation by George B. Ives published in 1901 by George Barrie &amp; Sons in Philadelphia as part of their 'Bibliothèque des Chefs-d'Oeuvre du Roman Contemporain' series. I've used 1846 as the year since that represents when Sand wrote the original work, which is most relevant for a historical timeline of literature. George Sand was the pen name of a woman writer, which was quite progressive for the era.

It has become one of the most recognizable pieces in the classical piano repertoire and has been arranged for orchestra and other ensembles.

    <summarium>&quot;Ten Years Later&quot; is part of the D'Artagnan Romances by Alexandre Dumas, specifically forming the middle section of &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne,&quot; the third and final novel in the series following &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844) and &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; (1845). The story continues the adventures of d'Artagnan and the musketeers during the reign of Louis XIV, covering events from 1660-1661. This portion focuses on political intrigue at the French court, romantic entanglements, and the aging musketeers' continued loyalty and adventures. The complete Vicomte de Bragelonne cycle is often split into multiple parts, with &quot;Ten Years Later&quot; representing chapters 76-140 of the larger work, though this Project Gutenberg edition (1258) includes chapters 1-104, overlapping with other editions. The series culminates in the famous &quot;Man in the Iron Mask&quot; storyline.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1848 represents when &quot;Le Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; was originally serialized and published in French. The entire work was published between 1847-1850, with 1848 being a reasonable median date for this middle section. The various Project Gutenberg editions reflect different English translation and publishing traditions that split Dumas's massive final D'Artagnan novel into 3-4 separate volumes. While the story is set in 1660-1661, the work itself is a mid-19th century historical novel.

    <summarium>The Sea Lions is a maritime adventure novel by James Fenimore Cooper, published in 1849. The story follows rival sealing expeditions to the Antarctic, combining Cooper's typical themes of adventure on the high seas with deeper philosophical and religious contemplations. The novel explores themes of faith, redemption, and man's relationship with the divine, set against the backdrop of dangerous seal hunting voyages in polar waters. The work is notable for its vivid descriptions of maritime life and the harsh conditions of Antarctic exploration, while also serving as a vehicle for Cooper's reflections on spiritual matters.
</summarium>
    <notae>The Sea Lions was originally published in 1849, though this Gutenberg edition appears to be from an 1860 printing (as indicated by the date on the title page). The novel was written late in Cooper's career and represents his mature work. The year 1849 is most historically accurate as it marks the work's first appearance and its place in American literary history. The preface excerpt suggests Cooper's concern with spiritual themes and mankind's indifference to divine presence, which is characteristic of his later works.

    <summarium>A firsthand account of an 1840s tour through the United States by British Nonconformist minister Ebenezer Davies, who had previously served as pastor in Berbice (British Guiana) to a congregation including many formerly enslaved people. The work focuses on observations of American slavery, particularly after entering through New Orleans, and examines American society through the lens of a British abolitionist. Davies also explores the development of Puritan and Nonconformist religious principles in America, particularly in New England. The book represents an important British Protestant perspective on antebellum American slavery.
</summarium>
    <notae>Published in 1849 as indicated by the Roman numerals MDCCCXLIX on the title page. This work is part of the broader transatlantic abolitionist literature of the pre-Civil War period. While Davies was a Christian minister, this is not marked as 'catholic' as he explicitly identifies with Puritan/Nonconformist (Protestant) traditions. Not marked as appropriate for children due to the subject matter of slavery and its treatment.

Founded by William John Thoms (who also coined the term 'folklore'), it became one of the most important venues for scholarly exchange in the 19th century.

    <summarium>The Moorland Cottage is a novella by Elizabeth Gaskell, first published in December 1850. It tells the story of Mrs. Browne, a widow living in a secluded cottage on the moorlands with her two children, Maggie and Edward, and their faithful servant Nancy. The tale explores themes of maternal favoritism, moral education, and the consequences of character formation. Mrs. Browne unwisely favors her son Edward over her daughter Maggie, leading to Edward's moral weakness and Maggie's quiet strength. The story is set in rural England and is characteristic of Gaskell's attention to domestic life and moral development. It's a shorter work compared to her major novels like Mary Barton or North and South, but demonstrates her skill in portraying family dynamics and social commentary within a compact narrative.
</summarium>
    <notae>The text states &quot;NEW YORK: 1851&quot; but this appears to be an American reprint. The work was first published in England in December 1850, so I've used 1850 as the original publication year, which is more historically accurate for timeline purposes. Elizabeth Gaskell was a Unitarian rather than Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag is not applicable despite her deeply moral and Christian themes.

    <summarium>Notes and Queries was a Victorian-era scholarly periodical founded in 1849 by William John Thoms that served as &quot;A Medium of Inter-Communication for Literary Men, Artists, Antiquaries, Genealogists, Etc.&quot; The journal featured scholarly notes, queries (questions posed by readers), and replies on topics ranging from folklore and literary history to genealogy and antiquarian studies. This issue (Number 31, June 1, 1850) contains articles on parish registers, Hudibrastic verse, folk lore, Jeremy Taylor's works, and various scholarly queries and replies typical of the publication. The motto &quot;When found, make a note of&quot; comes from Charles Dickens's Captain Cuttle character.

    <summarium>Notes and Queries was a highly influential Victorian scholarly periodical founded in 1849 by William John Thoms. It served as a forum for literary men, antiquaries, genealogists, and scholars to pose questions and share knowledge about historical, literary, and antiquarian topics. This issue (No. 22, March 30, 1850) is from its first full year of publication. The journal featured notes on various subjects, reader queries, replies to previous questions, and miscellanies. It became one of the most important venues for scholarly exchange in the Victorian era and continued publication for over a century. Contributors included many of the leading scholars and literary figures of the time.
</summarium>
    <notae>This is a single issue of a weekly periodical from 1850. The year is unambiguous as it's printed in the issue itself. Since this is a periodical rather than a single work, the &quot;author&quot; field lists &quot;Various&quot; as it contains contributions from multiple writers, though William John Thoms was the founding editor. The motto &quot;When found, make a note of&quot; is from Dickens's Captain Cuttle in Dombey and Son.

    <summarium>'The Wisdom of Life' (Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit) is one of Arthur Schopenhauer's \
most accessible philosophical essays, part of his 'Parerga and Paralipomena' (1851). \
In this work, Schopenhauer presents practical philosophy on how to achieve eudaimonia \
(happiness/flourishing) through understanding what truly contributes to human happiness. \
He divides human existence into three fundamental categories: what one is (personality), \
what one has (property), and what one represents (reputation/position). Despite his \
famous pessimism about existence, this essay offers practical wisdom for living well. \
Schopenhauer was heavily influenced by Kant, Plato, and Eastern philosophy, particularly \
Buddhism and Hinduism, though his philosophy is fundamentally atheistic and incompatible \
with Catholic teaching.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1851 as the year because that's when the original German work 'Parerga und \
Paralipomena' was published, which contains this essay. The T. Bailey Saunders English \
translation came later (1890s), but for historical timeline purposes, the original \
composition date is most educationally accurate. Note: Schopenhauer was baptized Lutheran \
but was an explicit atheist and pessimist who rejected Christian metaphysics, so this \
does not receive a 'catholic' tag despite its philosophical merit.

    <summarium>'The Grammar of English Grammars' is a comprehensive and prescriptive English grammar text by Goold Brown, first published in 1851. This massive work (often running to over 1,000 pages in its complete editions) represents one of the most exhaustive treatments of English grammar in the 19th century. Brown took an extremely prescriptive approach, critiquing other grammarians of his era and establishing rigid standards for correctness in English usage. The work includes extensive exercises, parsing examples, and analysis of disputed grammatical points. It was widely used in American schools during the mid-19th century and exemplifies the highly formal, rule-based approach to grammar instruction characteristic of that period. The transcriber's note about Brown's severity toward those who &quot;depart from his standard of correctness&quot; while the source text itself contains typographical errors is somewhat ironic and indicative of Brown's uncompromising pedagogical stance.
</summarium>
    <notae>The first edition was published in 1851. This work went through multiple editions and revisions throughout the 1850s and 1860s. The year 1851 represents the original publication date of this comprehensive grammar, which consolidated and expanded Brown's earlier grammatical works.

    <summarium>'Counsels and Maxims' (German: 'Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit') is part of Arthur Schopenhauer's 'Parerga and Paralipomena' (1851), a collection of philosophical essays. This particular section offers practical wisdom and guidance for living, covering topics like our relation to ourselves and others, worldly fortune, and the ages of life. Schopenhauer, known for his pessimistic philosophy influenced by Eastern thought and Kant, here presents accessible ethical reflections and life advice. The work is more practical than his metaphysical writings like 'The World as Will and Representation'. This English translation by T. Bailey Saunders made Schopenhauer's thought widely accessible to English readers in the late Victorian era.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1851 represents the original German publication date of 'Parerga and Paralipomena'. T. Bailey Saunders' English translation was published later (around 1890-1893), but since this is Schopenhauer's original work rather than a substantially modified edition, the original publication date is most historically accurate for timeline purposes.

    <summarium>&quot;Bataille de Dames&quot; (Battle of Ladies) is a popular French comedy of manners written collaboratively by Eugène Scribe and Ernest Legouvé. The play exemplifies the comédie-vaudeville style that Scribe helped develop and popularize during the 19th century. This particular edition was prepared as an educational text for English-speaking students learning French, complete with introduction, notes, and vocabulary by Professor Benjamin W. Wells. The play represents the lighter dramatic tradition of French theater, focusing on wit, intrigue, and social comedy rather than heavy moral instruction. Scribe was one of the most prolific and commercially successful French playwrights of his era, and this collaboration with Legouvé became a standard text in French language instruction.
</summarium>
    <notae>The play was first performed in 1851. This Project Gutenberg edition is the educational version prepared by Benjamin W. Wells, Ph.D., intended for students of French. The year 1851 represents the original composition and first performance date, which is the most historically significant date for this work.

    <summarium>This is the tenth book in 'The Good Child's Library' series, a collection of religious educational materials designed for children in the mid-19th century. The work presents the parables of Jesus Christ in verse form, making them more accessible and memorable for young readers. The book was published with elaborate color illustrations (using an oil color printing process that was innovative for its time) depicting biblical scenes. The series aimed to encourage Scripture reading among children by presenting New Testament narratives in an attractive, engaging format while maintaining doctrinal soundness suitable for Catholic instruction.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1851 is taken directly from the title page of this edition. This appears to be an American Catholic publication, as indicated by the publisher's claim to originating the oil color printing process &quot;in this country&quot; and the explicitly Catholic educational aims (references to making the Bible accessible while maintaining proper religious formation). The work is clearly intended to have ecclesiastical approval, given its educational purpose and the era's publishing standards for Catholic children's materials.

    <summarium>'The Evil Guest' is a gothic mystery novel by Irish author J. Sheridan Le Fanu, first serialized in the Dublin University Magazine in 1851. The story is set in England about sixty years before its publication (circa 1790s) and centers on the Marston family at their decaying estate called Gray Forest. The novel follows the Hon. Richard Marston, his wife, and their two children as they become entangled with a mysterious and sinister guest. Le Fanu was a master of gothic fiction and psychological suspense, and this early work displays his talent for creating atmosphere and dread. The novel explores themes of lust, sin, and death, as indicated by its biblical epigraph.
</summarium>
    <notae>The text displays '1895' which likely refers to a posthumous edition. Le Fanu died in 1873, so this would be a later reprint. The original publication was in 1851 as a serial, making it one of Le Fanu's earlier works. I chose 1851 as the year because it represents the work's original appearance and historical significance. The story itself is set &quot;about sixty years ago&quot; from the 1851 publication, placing the narrative around the 1790s.

    <summarium>Bleak House is one of Charles Dickens' major novels, published in serial form between 1852-1853. It is a complex social novel that satirizes the British judicial system, particularly the Court of Chancery, through the protracted case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The novel follows multiple interconnected storylines, including the young Esther Summerson's narrative, Lady Dedlock's mysterious past, and a large cast of memorable characters from various social classes. The novel is notable for its innovative dual narrative structure (third-person omniscient alternating with Esther's first-person account), its criticism of institutional incompetence and bureaucratic delays, its vivid portrayal of Victorian London including the slums of Tom-all-Alone's, and its detective plot elements involving Inspector Bucket. Dickens uses the interminable Chancery case as a metaphor for systemic dysfunction that destroys lives and drains resources. The novel is considered one of his finest achievements and a masterpiece of Victorian literature.
</summarium>
    <notae>Published in monthly installments from March 1852 to September 1853, then in book form in 1853. I've used 1853 as the canonical publication year since that's when the complete novel appeared in book form and is the date most commonly associated with the work historically.

    <summarium>A novella by Herman Melville about a Wall Street lawyer who hires a peculiar scrivener (law-copyist) named Bartleby.

    <summarium>'The Star-Chamber' is a historical romance by William Harrison Ainsworth set in early 17th-century England during the reign of King James I. The novel deals with the notorious Court of Star Chamber, a royal court that became infamous for its arbitrary and oppressive proceedings. The story involves Sir Giles Mompesson, a historical figure who was a corrupt courtier and patent monopolist, and features other historical figures including the Marquis of Buckingham, Prince Charles (later Charles I), and the Conde de Gondomar (Spanish ambassador). Ainsworth was known for his vivid historical romances that popularized English history through melodramatic narratives, and this work exemplifies his style of blending historical fact with romantic fiction.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1854. This appears to be the Tauchnitz Continental edition from the same year. Ainsworth was a Protestant English author writing popular historical fiction, not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply despite the historical setting that would have included Catholic characters.

    <summarium>'The Pearl Box' is a 19th century religious children's book written by an anonymous pastor. Based on the Project Gutenberg metadata indicating it's part of the &quot;Preservation and Access for American and British Children's Literature, 1850-1869&quot; collection, this appears to be a devotional or moral instruction book designed to teach Christian virtues and religious lessons to young readers. Such works were common in the mid-Victorian era and typically contained stories, parables, or meditations designed to instill Christian values in children.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year is difficult to determine since the author is listed only as &quot;A Pastor&quot; and the actual text file is empty. Based on the Project Gutenberg PALMM collection dating (1850-1869) and the style of such anonymous pastoral works for children, I've estimated circa 1855 as a midpoint of that era. The work appears to be Christian religious instruction material, and given the anonymous pastoral authorship and devotional nature for children, it likely would have been considered appropriate for Catholic readers, though the specific denominational affiliation cannot be confirmed without the actual text.

    <summarium>This is a collected edition of the complete poetical works of four prominent 18th-century British writers: Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), Thomas Parnell (1679-1718), Thomas Gray (1716-1771), and Tobias Smollett (1721-1771). The volume was edited by Rev. George Gilfillan and includes biographical memoirs, critical dissertations, and explanatory notes for each poet. The anthology represents the Romantic-era Victorian interest in preserving and analyzing 18th-century English literature, particularly poetry. Johnson is represented by works including his famous imitations of Juvenal (&quot;London&quot; and &quot;The Vanity of Human Wishes&quot;) along with various prologues. This type of collected edition was popular in the mid-19th century as a way to make classic poetry accessible to educated readers.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1855 as the year because this is an editorial compilation published in that year, not a collection of the original publication dates of the individual poems. The original works span from the early 1700s to the late 1700s, but this specific volume as a curated scholarly edition dates to 1855. This is indicated by the Roman numeral M.DCCC.LV. on the title page.

    <summarium>A children's story published in the mid-19th century by John R. Bolles. Based on the title and publication context (Daniel Burgess &amp; Co. was a publisher of children's literature), this appears to be a moral or instructive tale featuring two bulls, likely designed to convey lessons about character, behavior, or virtue to young readers in the tradition of 19th-century children's literature.

    <summarium>Wau-Bun is a pioneering memoir of frontier life in the Wisconsin Territory during the 1830s. Written by Juliette Kinzie, wife of Indian agent John H. Kinzie, the work provides a firsthand account of life at Fort Winnebago and interactions with various Native American tribes, particularly the Ojibwe and Potawatomi peoples. The title, meaning &quot;the dawn&quot; in Ojibwe, symbolically refers both to early morning and to the early days of American settlement in the Northwest Territory. The book is valued as an important historical document of frontier life, Native American relations, and the role of women in western expansion. It offers detailed descriptions of Native American customs, frontier society, and the landscape of early Wisconsin.
</summarium>
    <notae>The text shown is from an 1873 Philadelphia edition, but the work was originally published in 1856. This is considered one of the first books written by a woman about the American frontier and remains an important primary source for historians studying the Old Northwest Territory and early Chicago history.

    <summarium>This is Austin Steward's slave narrative, published in 1857 (though dated 1856 in some editions). Steward was enslaved for twenty-two years before gaining his freedom and becoming a prominent abolitionist and community leader. The work documents his experiences under slavery and his subsequent forty years of freedom, including his time as president of the Wilberforce Colony in London, Canada West (Ontario), one of the settlements established for formerly enslaved people who escaped to Canada. The narrative includes correspondence from his time leading this colony. Slave narratives like this were crucial primary sources documenting the horrors of slavery and were important tools in the abolitionist movement. Steward's account is particularly notable for its documentation of both the Southern slave experience and the post-emancipation challenges of building free Black communities in Canada.
</summarium>
    <notae>The work was published in Rochester in 1856/1857 (there's some ambiguity in dating - the title page says 1856, but it was published in September 1856 and often cataloged as 1857). I've chosen 1857 as it appears to be the more common scholarly dating. The letter from Governor Myron H. Clark of New York dated May 10, 1856 shows Steward was soliciting subscribers before publication. This is a historically significant primary source document from the antebellum period.

    <summarium>&quot;Natalie; or, A Gem Among the Sea-Weeds&quot; is a mid-19th century American sentimental novel by Ferna Vale. Published in 1859, it exemplifies the domestic fiction popular during that era, focusing on moral and spiritual themes. The preface indicates the work has Christian undertones, encouraging readers to take up their cross with &quot;meekness and humility&quot; and find the path home to spiritual redemption. The novel is set against a coastal backdrop, as suggested by the chapter epigraph about &quot;childhood's home&quot; by the &quot;wave-lashed shore.&quot; Like much sentimental fiction of the period, it likely follows its protagonist Natalie through moral trials and spiritual growth. Ferna Vale was a pseudonymous American author of the antebellum period who wrote primarily moralistic fiction for young readers and women.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1859 is taken directly from the title page. This places the work in the final years before the American Civil War, during the height of sentimental domestic fiction's popularity in America. The dedication to &quot;my darling Hattie&quot; and the author's hope for &quot;a purer gem&quot; suggests the intimate, morally instructive tone characteristic of the genre.

    <summarium>This is an essay from The Atlantic Monthly magazine published in July 1859, 
examining Thomas Paine's return to the United States and the partisan political 
atmosphere of the early American republic. The article discusses the intense 
party divisions between Federalists and Anti-Federalists in the years following 
the adoption of the Constitution, providing historical context for understanding 
the reception of controversial figures like Paine. The author reflects on how 
the political violence and bitterness of that era exceeded even the sectional 
tensions of 1859 (on the eve of the Civil War). This is a piece of historical 
analysis and political commentary characteristic of Atlantic Monthly's literary 
and intellectual content in the mid-19th century.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1859 - the publication date in The Atlantic Monthly. This is a 
magazine article, not a standalone work, so the publication year is the most 
historically accurate date. This is NOT a work by Thomas Paine himself, but 
rather a 19th-century essay about Paine's historical impact.

    <summarium>The Atlantic Monthly (later The Atlantic) was founded in 1857 in Boston as a literary and cultural magazine. This particular issue appears to be from around 1859-1860 based on the table of contents, which includes serialized fiction like Harriet Beecher Stowe's &quot;The Minister's Wooing&quot; (which ran in the magazine from December 1858 to December 1859). The magazine featured essays, poetry, fiction, and commentary on politics and culture, and became one of America's most prestigious literary journals. Contributors in its early years included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., and Harriet Beecher Stowe among other prominent American writers.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1860 is chosen as a best estimate based on &quot;The Minister's Wooing&quot; appearing in the contents, which was serialized 1858-1859, suggesting this is likely an 1859 or early 1860 issue. Without more specific information about which volume/issue this represents, 1860 serves as a representative year for this early period of the magazine. This is not appropriate for children as it's a sophisticated literary magazine aimed at adult readers. It is not tagged as 'catholic' as The Atlantic Monthly was a general interest magazine without specific religious affiliation, though it may have included works by Catholic authors among its varied contributors.

    <summarium>This is an issue of The Atlantic Monthly magazine from February 1861, containing an article about American painter William Page and his work in Italy. The Atlantic Monthly was (and remains) one of America's most prestigious literary and cultural magazines, founded in 1857 in Boston. This particular article discusses Page's artistic philosophy and technique, particularly his approach to painting and use of color. The magazine during this period featured essays, fiction, poetry, and commentary on literature, art, and politics, and was associated with prominent American writers and intellectuals of the era.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1861 is the publication date of this specific issue. William Page (1811-1885) was an American portrait and historical painter who spent significant time in Italy. This article was published just before the American Civil War began (April 1861). The Atlantic Monthly during this period was at the height of its influence in American intellectual life.

    <summarium>A firsthand account of Giuseppe Garibaldi's famous Expedition of the Thousand (Spedizione dei Mille) in Sicily and Italy, written by H. Durand-Brager who accompanied the expedition. The work documents four months of Garibaldi's military campaign that led to the unification of Italy in 1860-1861. Durand-Brager, who knew Garibaldi from his earlier time in the Río de la Plata region of South America, presents himself as an eyewitness chronicler focusing on the pictorial and immediate aspects of the campaign rather than political commentary. The book was published in Paris in 1861, shortly after the events it describes, providing a contemporary French perspective on one of the most significant military and political events of the Italian Risorgimento.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1861 reflects the original publication date as stated on the title page. The events described took place primarily in 1860 (Garibaldi's conquest of Sicily and Naples), with the account published immediately afterward in 1861 while the Italian unification process was still ongoing. This is a contemporary historical document rather than a retrospective history.

    <summarium>&quot;The Dog Crusoe and His Master&quot; is an adventure novel by Scottish author R.M. Ballantyne, set in the Western Prairies of North America. The story follows a young frontiersman and his faithful dog Crusoe through various adventures in the American wilderness. Ballantyne was known for his juvenile adventure fiction, and this work exemplifies his style of exciting, morally upright tales suitable for young readers. The novel combines themes of friendship, loyalty, courage, and survival in the untamed frontier, typical of Ballantyne's works which often drew on real settings and experiences to create engaging stories for Victorian youth.
</summarium>
    <notae>The original publication date was 1861. The 1894 date shown in this Gutenberg text appears to be a later edition. Ballantyne wrote this novel based on his own experiences and observations of frontier life, though he took considerable literary license. While Ballantyne himself was Presbyterian (Scottish), this particular work is straightforward adventure fiction without specifically Catholic content, so it does not receive the 'catholic' tag despite being morally instructive and appropriate for children.

    <summarium>A 19th-century descriptive and narrative work about Brittany (Bretagne), the Celtic region of northwestern France. Written during a period of rapid European modernization, Loudun documents the landscapes, customs, language, and traditional character of Brittany, which had largely preserved its distinct cultural identity. The work particularly focuses on how different Breton departments (Finistère, Ille-et-Vilaine, Côtes-du-Nord, Morbihan) were experiencing varying degrees of modernization, with Finistère being the most traditional. Loudun observes that women were the primary preservers of traditional costumes and customs, being &quot;guardians of the hearth&quot; who maintained connections to ancestral traditions.</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1861 is explicitly stated on the title page. This work belongs to the 19th-century French tradition of regional ethnographic literature, documenting traditional cultures that were beginning to disappear due to modernization and centralization under the French state.

    <summarium>Utilitarianism is one of the most influential works in moral philosophy, written by John Stuart Mill. The book presents and defends the utilitarian ethical theory, which holds that actions are right insofar as they promote happiness and wrong insofar as they produce unhappiness. Mill refines earlier utilitarian thought (particularly from Jeremy Bentham) by introducing qualitative distinctions between pleasures and arguing that some pleasures are inherently more valuable than others. The work addresses major objections to utilitarianism and explores the connection between utility and justice. It remains a foundational text in consequentialist ethics and continues to influence moral and political philosophy.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in Fraser's Magazine in 1861 as a series of three articles. The first book edition appeared in 1863. I've chosen 1861 as the historically significant date when the work first appeared in print. This 1879 edition is the seventh edition published by Longmans, Green, and Co. Mill was not Catholic - he was a secular philosopher and one of the leading figures of British empiricism and liberalism.

    <summarium>'Battle Hymn of the Republic' is one of the most famous American patriotic songs, written during the American Civil War. Julia Ward Howe wrote the lyrics in November 1861 after visiting a Union Army camp near Washington, D.C. The poem was set to the tune of 'John Brown's Body' and first published in The Atlantic Monthly in February 1862. The hymn became an anthem for the Union cause during the Civil War and has remained a significant piece of American cultural and religious heritage, often performed at patriotic ceremonies and in church settings. The lyrics invoke biblical imagery and Christian themes of righteousness and divine justice, framing the Union cause in apocalyptic terms.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1862 reflects the first publication in The Atlantic Monthly (February 1862), though it was written in late 1861. This Project Gutenberg entry is an audio recording by Roger McGuinn, but the work itself dates to 1862.

    <summarium>A Civil War-era novel published during the conflict itself in 1862. The story deals with themes of love and political division during the American Civil War. Fort Lafayette was a real military installation in New York Harbor that was used during the Civil War to imprison Confederate sympathizers, prisoners of war, and those accused of disloyalty to the Union. Benjamin Wood was a New York Democratic politician and newspaper editor who owned the New York Daily News and was known for his sympathy toward the South and criticism of Lincoln's wartime policies. The novel explores the tensions between loyalty, love, and political conviction during America's most divisive period.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1862 is clearly stated on the title page as MDCCCLXII. This work was published contemporaneously with the Civil War events it depicts, making it a primary source of Civil War literature rather than a historical retrospective. The epigraphs from Thomson and Shakespeare about peace suggest the novel's themes of reconciliation and the costs of conflict.

    <summarium>Captain Fracasse (Le Capitaine Fracasse) is a historical adventure novel by French author Théophile Gautier, set in 17th century France during the reign of Louis XIII. The story follows the Baron de Sigognac, an impoverished nobleman living in a dilapidated castle in Gascony, who joins a traveling theater troupe and adopts the stage name &quot;Captain Fracasse.&quot; The novel combines swashbuckling adventure, romance, and social commentary as the protagonist encounters brigands, duels, and aristocratic intrigue while falling in love with one of the actresses. Gautier's work is notable for its vivid historical detail, romantic atmosphere, and celebration of theatrical life in 17th century France. It's considered one of Gautier's major works and a classic of French romantic literature.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was originally published in 1863, though it is set in the 1630s during the reign of Louis XIII. Gautier began writing it much earlier but didn't complete it until the 1860s. The 1863 date represents the original French publication, which is the most historically significant date for this work.

    <summarium>Charles Kingsley (1819-1875) was an English clergyman, novelist, and social reformer associated with Christian Socialism and the Broad Church movement within Anglicanism. 'The Gospel of the Pentateuch' is a collection of parish sermons exploring Christian theological themes found in the first five books of the Hebrew Bible (Torah). Kingsley was known for his muscular Christianity philosophy and efforts to make Christianity socially relevant. The work is dedicated to Canon Stanley, whose writings on the Jewish Church influenced Kingsley's approach. As a collection of sermons, it represents Victorian Anglican homiletics and biblical interpretation, seeking to draw out the evangelical message (gospel) from Old Testament narratives.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year isn't stated in the excerpt, but Charles Kingsley's sermons were typically published in the 1860s. Based on historical records, 'The Gospel of the Pentateuch' was first published around 1863. While Kingsley was a clergyman in the Church of England (Anglican), this work would not receive a Catholic imprimatur as Anglicanism separated from Rome in the 16th century. The work represents Protestant biblical interpretation and homiletics rather than Catholic tradition.

    <summarium>This work is a first-hand account by Edwin Waugh, a Lancashire dialect poet and writer, documenting the lives of cotton mill workers during the Cotton Famine of 1861-1865. The famine was caused by the American Civil War, which disrupted cotton supplies to Lancashire's textile mills, causing massive unemployment and hardship. Waugh traveled through Lancashire observing and recording the conditions, resilience, and daily struggles of the working-class families affected by the crisis. The book provides valuable social history and eyewitness testimony of one of the most significant economic disasters in 19th-century British industrial history.
</summarium>
    <notae>The Cotton Famine lasted from 1861-1865, but most accounts and Waugh's observations were published around 1862-1863 as the crisis was unfolding. Without access to the full text's publication details, 1863 is the most likely original publication year, as this was when Waugh was most actively documenting and publishing his observations of the famine conditions. Some editions may have appeared slightly earlier or later, but mid-famine (1862-1864) represents the period of Waugh's reporting.

    <summarium>'Frank the Young Naturalist' is the first book in Harry Castlemon's popular 'Gun-Boat Series' (also known as the 'Frank and Archie Series'). Harry Castlemon was the pen name of Charles Austin Fosdick (1842-1915), a prolific American author who wrote adventure stories for boys in the late 19th century. This series follows the adventures of Frank Nelson, a young naturalist, through various Civil War-era adventures including naval service on Union gunboats and outdoor expeditions. The series was enormously popular with young readers and helped establish the genre of American boys' adventure fiction. Castlemon himself served in the Union Navy during the Civil War, lending authenticity to his naval adventure stories.
</summarium>
    <notae>The text shows a publication date of 1892, which is likely a reprint edition. The original publication was in 1864 during the American Civil War. I've chosen 1864 as it represents the work's original entry into American literature and is more historically significant for timeline purposes. This is secular juvenile fiction, not Catholic literature.

    <summarium>A firsthand account of the American Civil War written by Thomas W. Knox, a correspondent for the New York Herald. The book chronicles Knox's experiences traveling with Union armies and his observations while residing on a Louisiana plantation during the war. As a journalist embedded with Union forces, Knox recorded the military campaigns and daily life of soldiers, providing contemporary documentation of the conflict. The work offers a Northern perspective on the war, combining military history with social observations of the occupied South.
</summarium>
    <notae>1865 is the original publication year as stated in the book itself. This was published very shortly after the end of the Civil War (which concluded in April 1865), making it one of the earliest published accounts of the conflict. The book is dedicated to press correspondents who covered the Union armies.

    <summarium>This is a firsthand account by Thomas W. Knox, a war correspondent for the New York Herald, documenting his experiences with the Union armies during the American Civil War (1861-1865). The book chronicles Knox's adventures following Union forces through various campaigns, as well as his time spent on a Louisiana plantation during the war. As a journalist embedded with the troops, Knox provides eyewitness accounts of military operations, camp life, and the social and economic conditions in the South during this tumultuous period. The work is dedicated to fellow press representatives who covered the war and offers valuable primary source material on the conflict from a Northern correspondent's perspective.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year of 1865 is clearly stated in the book itself and represents the immediate post-war publication. This is the original publication date. Knox was a prominent war correspondent known for his reporting on campaigns in the Western Theater of the Civil War, including his controversial coverage of the Vicksburg Campaign. This work represents one of the early published memoirs from the Civil War period, appearing in the same year the war ended.

    <summarium>A collection of extraordinary tales by French naturalist and explorer Bénédict-Henry Révoil (1816-1882), based on his travels in North America. The work contains adventure stories set in the American wilderness, particularly along the Mississippi River and frontier regions. Révoil was known for his vivid descriptions of American wildlife, landscapes, and frontier life. These tales combine elements of natural history observation with adventure narrative, written in an engaging style suitable for general audiences. The excerpt shown describes a winter journey on the Mississippi River where the narrator becomes trapped by ice and must wait out the freeze while hunting in the surrounding wilderness.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication date is somewhat uncertain as Révoil published multiple collections of American adventure tales during the 1860s-1870s. 1865 is an approximate date based on the period of his most active publishing following his American travels. The work reflects the 19th-century French fascination with the American frontier and wilderness.

    <summarium>A practical manual on mule breeding, training, and management written by Harvey Riley, who served as Superintendent of the Government Corral in Washington D.C. during the Civil War era. Drawing on thirty years of experience, Riley advocates strongly for humane treatment of mules and argues that the government could save significant resources by requiring proper training for teamsters and wagon-masters. The work reflects the crucial role mules played in 19th century American agriculture, transportation, and military logistics, while also serving as an early advocacy piece for animal welfare. Riley's perspective combines practical expertise with a reform-minded approach to improving working conditions for these essential draft animals.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1867 is unambiguous - it appears both on the title page and in the dated preface (April 12, 1867). This work was published shortly after the American Civil War, during which mules played an essential role in military logistics. The author's position as Superintendent of the Government Corral and his advocacy for government reform in animal management reflects the massive scale of animal use (and loss) during the war years.

    <summarium>Lettres de mon moulin (Letters from My Windmill) is a collection of short stories by French author Alphonse Daudet, first published in 1869. The work presents itself as letters written from a windmill in Provence, though Daudet never actually lived in one. The stories are charming, pastoral tales set in the Provençal countryside, blending humor, pathos, and vivid local color. The collection includes well-known stories like &quot;La Chèvre de Monsieur Seguin&quot; (Mr. Seguin's Goat) and &quot;L'Arlésienne.&quot; The work is celebrated for its evocative depiction of southern French rural life and its accessible, engaging prose style. It remains a beloved classic of French literature, often studied in schools.
</summarium>
    <notae>The work was initially published as serialized stories in various periodicals starting in 1866, then collected and published as a book in 1869. I've chosen 1869 as it marks the first complete publication as a unified collection. The mock-notarial deed (&quot;Avant-Propos&quot;) that opens the work is Daudet's fictional literary device establishing his claim to the windmill from which the letters are supposedly written.

    <summarium>'Our Churches and Chapels' is a Victorian-era work of local history and religious sociology by Anthony Hewitson (writing as 'Atticus'), a journalist for the Preston Chronicle. The book provides a critical and historical survey of every place of worship in Preston, Lancashire, England, including descriptions of the buildings, clergy, and congregations. Originally serialized in the Preston Chronicle newspaper, it offers a snapshot of religious life in an English industrial town during the Victorian period, with commentary on various denominations including Anglican, Catholic, and Nonconformist chapels. The work is notable for its journalistic style and sometimes satirical observations of local religious institutions and their leaders.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1869 represents the approximate first book publication, though the articles originally appeared serialized in the Preston Chronicle newspaper slightly earlier. This is a work of local history and religious commentary rather than theology, written from a journalistic perspective about a specific English town's religious landscape during the Victorian era.

    <summarium>'Minnie's Sacrifice' is a serialized novel by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, one of the most prominent African-American writers and activists of the 19th century. The novel tells the story of the tragic consequences of slavery, focusing on themes of racial identity, motherhood, and the destruction of families under the institution of slavery. It follows characters affected by slavery's brutal realities, including sexual exploitation and the separation of families. Harper was a pioneering voice in African-American literature, and this work reflects her deep commitment to abolition and civil rights. The novel was originally serialized in the Christian Recorder and was considered lost for many years before being rediscovered and republished in the late 20th century.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1869 reflects when this novel was originally serialized in the Christian Recorder, a weekly publication of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This was during the Reconstruction era, just after the Civil War. While Harper lived from 1825-1911 and published works over six decades, this particular novel comes from her immediate post-Civil War period when she was actively writing about the legacy of slavery and the challenges facing newly freed African Americans. The novel was considered lost literature until Frances Smith Foster rediscovered and edited it for modern publication.

    <summarium>Frances Ridley Havergal (1836-1879) was a devout English hymn writer and religious poet, known for her deep evangelical piety and consecration literature. 'Coming to the King' is a devotional work exploring themes of Christian commitment, surrender to Christ, and intimate relationship with God. Havergal was particularly known for her hymns including 'Take My Life and Let It Be' and 'Like a River Glorious.' Her writings emphasize total consecration to Christ and living in His presence. Though Anglican, her deeply spiritual and orthodox Christian writings focusing on devotion to Christ and scriptural meditation align with traditional catholic (universal Christian) spirituality and would likely be viewed favorably from a Catholic perspective due to their christocentric focus and orthodox theology.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year is estimated as circa 1870s during Havergal's most productive writing period. Her major devotional works were published between 1870-1879. Given the Project Gutenberg release suggests this was a well-established work by 2004, and Havergal's career peak was in the 1870s, I've chosen 1870 as a reasonable approximate date. If more precise bibliographic information were available, this could be refined. The work represents Victorian evangelical devotional literature at its height.

It was modeled after the famous British magazine Punch and featured political cartoons, satirical commentary, jokes, and humorous observations on American society and politics of the Reconstruction era. The magazine was short-lived, running for approximately one year (1870-1871), but provides valuable insight into American humor and social commentary of the early 1870s.

    <summarium>&quot;Seitsemän veljestä&quot; (Seven Brothers) is considered the first significant novel in Finnish literature and one of the most important works in the Finnish language. Written by Aleksis Kivi, it tells the story of seven brothers - Juhani, Tuomas, Aapo, Simeoni, Timo, Lauri, and Eero - who live on the Jukola farm in southern Häme. The novel chronicles their wild, often comedic adventures as they resist civilization (particularly learning to read, attending church, and following social norms) and eventually mature into responsible citizens. The work is both a coming-of-age story and a vivid portrayal of rural Finnish life in the 19th century. It has been enormously influential in Finnish culture and is still widely read today.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1870 as the primary year since this was when the work was first published, even though it appeared in installments. The 1873 date represents the first single-volume edition, and 1890 is this particular edition. The original 1870 publication date is most historically significant for educational purposes, as it marks when this groundbreaking work entered Finnish literature.

    <summarium>François Guizot's comprehensive six-volume History of France is a monumental work of 19th-century historiography. Written by one of France's leading historians and statesmen, this work traces French history from its earliest origins through the medieval period and beyond. Guizot's approach was notable for his emphasis on the development of civilization and institutions, rather than mere chronological recitation of events. In the introduction, Guizot articulates his philosophy of history as containing both &quot;fated causes&quot; (general laws and trends) and &quot;unrestricted causes&quot; (human free will and agency). The work was originally conceived as stories told to his grandchildren, giving it an accessible narrative quality while maintaining scholarly rigor.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact year of publication is somewhat ambiguous as the multi-volume French original was published over several years in the early 1870s. I've chosen 1872 as a representative date for the beginning of this major work's publication. Guizot was a Protestant, not Catholic, so despite the historical and scholarly nature of this work, it would not carry Catholic ecclesiastical approval.

    <notae>First published in 1872. Charles Kingsley was an Anglican clergyman and Christian socialist who believed in making education accessible to working people.

    <summarium>&quot;Bits of Home Matters&quot; is a collection of essays by Helen Hunt Jackson (who wrote under the pen name &quot;H.H.&quot;) focused on domestic life, child-rearing, and family matters in Victorian America. The work addresses various aspects of parenting and household management, with particular emphasis on treating children with kindness and respect. Topics include critiques of harsh parenting practices (corporal punishment, breaking children's wills), the importance of courtesy within families, children's education and social development, and various domestic concerns. Jackson was a prolific American writer known for her advocacy work and literary contributions in the late 19th century, though she is perhaps best known today for her novel &quot;Ramona&quot; and her advocacy for Native American rights.

While Jackson was Episcopalian rather than Catholic, this work focuses on humane, compassionate parenting and would likely be compatible with Catholic moral teaching on the dignity of children, though it would not qualify for the 'catholic' tag under your specified criteria.

This scholarly edition was chronologically arranged, revised and enlarged with notes from previous commentators plus new annotations by Hazlitt. The volume contains five Renaissance-era dramatic works: &quot;How a Man May Choose a Good Wife from a Bad,&quot; &quot;The Return from Parnassus,&quot; &quot;Wily Beguiled,&quot; &quot;Lingua,&quot; and &quot;The Miseries of Enforced Marriage.&quot; These plays represent important examples of late Elizabethan and early Jacobean drama, performed by various theatrical companies in the early 1600s. Hazlitt's work was part of a significant Victorian-era scholarly effort to preserve and document early English theatrical history.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1874 as the year because this is the date of Hazlitt's edition (the header indicates 1874-76 for the series). While the individual plays date from the early 1600s (the first play &quot;How a Man May Choose&quot; shows editions from 1602-1634), this particular text is a scholarly collection and compilation work. The historical and educational value lies in Hazlitt's editorial work and commentary on these Renaissance plays, not the original composition dates of the individual works. If you were cataloging the individual plays themselves rather than this scholarly edition, you would use their original dates (circa 1600-1610).

    <summarium>This is the eighth volume of W. Carew Hazlitt's revised and expanded edition of Robert Dodsley's classic collection of old English plays, originally published in 1744. This fourth edition, published 1874-1876, chronologically arranges and annotates Renaissance and early modern English dramatic works. Volume VIII includes five plays: Thomas Nashe's 'Summer's Last Will and Testament' (1600), 'The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntington', 'The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington', 'Contention between Liberality and Prodigality', and 'Grim the Collier of Croydon'. These are important specimens of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, preserving works that might otherwise have been lost to history. Hazlitt's scholarly edition includes comprehensive notes from previous commentators as well as his own annotations.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1874 as the publication year for this specific volume, which is when Hazlitt's edition began publication (the full series was published 1874-1876). This is a scholarly collection rather than an original creative work, so the date represents when this important editorial project made these historical plays accessible to Victorian readers and scholars. The plays contained within range from the late 16th to early 17th centuries.

    <summarium>'The City of Dreadful Night' is a long Victorian poem by James Thomson (writing as B.V., for Bysshe Vanolis), first published serially in the National Reformer in 1874. The poem is considered one of the most powerful expressions of philosophical pessimism and religious doubt in Victorian literature. It depicts a nightmarish, allegorical city where the inhabitants wander in despair, having lost all hope of divine salvation or transcendent meaning. The work is influenced by Dante's Inferno (hence the epigraph 'Per me si va nella citta dolente' - 'Through me you enter the sorrowful city') and by Leopardi's philosophical pessimism. Thomson's dark vision reflects his own struggles with alcoholism, depression, and loss of faith. The poem is a cornerstone of Victorian atheistic and nihilistic literature, expressing profound alienation and existential despair.
</summarium>
    <notae>The poem was first published in serial form in the National Reformer magazine from March to May 1874, and this is the date most commonly associated with the work. It was later published in book form in 1880. Thomson (1834-1882) was a Scottish poet who adopted the pen name B.V. in honor of Shelley (Bysshe) and Novalis. The work stands in stark contrast to Catholic literature and represents Victorian crisis of faith.

    <summarium>&quot;Fated to Be Free&quot; is a Victorian novel by English poet and novelist Jean Ingelow, first published in 1875. The work is connected to another of her stories, &quot;Off the Skelligs.&quot; In her preface to the American edition, Ingelow explains that she deliberately avoided creating a conventional &quot;work of art&quot; and instead attempted to produce &quot;a piece of nature&quot; - a chronicle that would give readers a sense of reality rather than a carefully crafted artistic story. The novel is notable for its unconventional approach: it features a remarkable child who grows into a commonplace man, includes many children throughout (unlike most adult fiction), and focuses on older, more mature characters as the most important and interesting figures, rather than following the Victorian convention of young heroes and heroines. Ingelow was a popular Victorian author known for her poetry and children's literature, including &quot;Mopsa the Fairy.&quot;
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1875 is printed directly on the title page. This appears to be the original publication date for this novel. Jean Ingelow (1820-1897) was a respected Victorian writer, though not Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag was not included.

    <summarium>This is a historic audio recording from Thomas Edison, representing one of the earliest sound recordings ever made. &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; was famously the first words Edison recorded and played back on his phonograph invention in 1877. This Project Gutenberg item is an MP3 format preservation of that historic recording, made available through the Edison National Historic Site. The work is significant not as a literary work but as a technological and historical artifact demonstrating the birth of recorded sound.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1877 is chosen because this represents when Edison first successfully recorded and played back sound using his phonograph, with &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; being the test phrase he spoke. While this specific digital file was released to Project Gutenberg in 2003, the historically significant date is the original 1877 recording. This is primarily a historical/technological artifact rather than a literary work.

    <summarium>A social novel by French author Hector Malot, best known for his work 'Sans Famille' (Nobody's Boy). Malot was a prolific 19th-century French novelist who wrote extensively about social issues and the struggles of ordinary people in French society. This work appears to deal with the world of inventors and patents, exploring the commercial exploitation and difficulties faced by inventors in Paris. The opening passage describes the &quot;Office cosmopolitain des inventeurs&quot; (Cosmopolitan Office of Inventors) and metaphorically portrays it as a machine that grinds down its clients - inventors seeking patents and commercial success.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1877 is approximate based on Malot's active publishing period and the style of the work. Hector Malot published numerous novels throughout the 1860s-1890s. This work shows his characteristic social realism and critique of commercial exploitation. The text is not marked as appropriate-for-children as it appears to be aimed at adult readers with its satirical and somewhat dark portrayal of business practices.

    <summarium>This collection contains three works by Gustave Flaubert spanning his career. 'The Dance of Death' (1838) is an early romantic prose poem written when Flaubert was seventeen, showing the influence of the Romantic movement. 'The Legend of Saint-Julian the Hospitaller' and 'A Simple Soul' are two of the three tales from 'Trois Contes' (Three Tales), published in 1877. 'Saint-Julian' is a medieval legend about a nobleman cursed to kill his parents who finds redemption through hospitality and charity. 'A Simple Soul' tells the story of Félicité, a devoted servant woman whose simple faith and capacity for love define her life. These mature works showcase Flaubert's mastery of prose style and his ability to portray human experience with psychological depth and restraint.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen is 1877, when 'Trois Contes' was published, as these two mature tales represent the primary literary significance of this collection. 'The Dance of Death' was written in 1838 during Flaubert's youth. While Flaubert was raised Catholic and these works engage with Christian themes (especially 'Saint-Julian'), Flaubert himself was not a practicing Catholic writer in the devotional sense, so the 'catholic' tag is not included.

    <summarium>A collection of short stories by Minna Canth, one of Finland's most significant 19th-century authors and social reformers. Canth was known for her realistic depictions of Finnish society, particularly focusing on the lives of women, workers, and the poor. Her stories often addressed social injustices and advocated for women's rights and equality. This collection includes various tales written between 1877-1895, including 'Hemmo,' 'Ensimmäiset markkinat' (First Markets), 'Äiti ja poika' (Mother and Son), and others. Canth's work was groundbreaking in Finnish literature for its social realism and feminist perspectives.
</summarium>
    <notae>The collection was published posthumously in 1917-19, but contains stories originally written between 1877-1895. I've chosen 1877 as the year since it represents when Canth began publishing these short stories, making it the most historically accurate date for understanding the work's original cultural context and impact. The individual stories were published separately during her lifetime before being collected in this volume.

    <summarium>'The House That Jack Built' is a traditional English nursery rhyme and cumulative tale, part of the Mother Goose collection. This particular edition is one of Randolph Caldecott's famous Picture Books, published in 1878. The rhyme builds upon itself in a repetitive pattern, introducing a chain of characters and events connected to a house that Jack built. Caldecott's illustrations transformed the simple nursery rhyme into a beloved illustrated work that significantly influenced children's book illustration. His lively, humorous drawings brought new life to traditional rhymes and earned him lasting recognition in children's literature.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1878 as the year because this is specifically the Randolph Caldecott illustrated edition published by Frederick Warne &amp; Co., which is what makes this Project Gutenberg text distinctive. The rhyme itself dates back to at least the 16th century and possibly earlier, with various origins proposed (some suggest it may derive from an Aramaic chant or have connections to historical events). However, the 1878 Caldecott edition is a significant publication in its own right and represents when this particular version entered the world. The Caldecott Medal, awarded annually to distinguished American picture books for children, was named after Randolph Caldecott in recognition of his pioneering work in children's book illustration.

    <summarium>&quot;The Return of the Native&quot; is Thomas Hardy's sixth published novel and one of his most famous works set in the fictional region of Wessex (based on Dorset, England). The novel tells the story of Clym Yeobright, a native son who returns to Egdon Heath from Paris, and his tragic romance with the beautiful and restless Eustacia Vye. The heath itself functions almost as a character in the novel, representing the wild, unchanging forces of nature against which human ambitions and desires play out. The novel explores themes of fate, ambition, love, and the conflict between urban sophistication and rural simplicity. Hardy's fatalistic worldview is on full display as characters struggle against circumstances largely beyond their control, leading to tragedy. The novel is notable for its rich descriptive passages of the heath landscape and its psychological complexity in depicting characters caught between their desires and their circumstances.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was first published in serial form in Belgravia magazine from January to December 1878, and then published in book form in three volumes in November 1878. I've chosen 1878 as the year since this represents the original publication date when the work became available to the reading public. Hardy was not a Catholic author - he was raised Anglican but became increasingly agnostic/atheistic in his views, and his novels often express a deterministic, fatalistic worldview that would not receive Catholic approval.

    <summarium>'John Caldigate' is a novel by Anthony Trollope that follows the story of its titular character, a young English gentleman who travels to the Australian goldfields to make his fortune after falling into debt. The novel explores themes of redemption, marriage, and moral character as Caldigate returns to England, marries Hester Bolton, and then faces accusations of bigamy from a woman he knew in Australia. The story examines Victorian society's judgment, the legal system, and questions of truth and reputation. It's one of Trollope's later novels, featuring his characteristic exploration of social conventions, morality, and the complications of personal relationships within the constraints of Victorian England.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was first published in 1879 (serialized 1878-1879). This is a straightforward single-author work without substantial commentary, so the original publication year is used. The work is considered appropriate for children by Victorian standards and lacks the mature content that would make it inappropriate for younger readers, though it deals with adult themes like marriage, legal proceedings, and moral questions in Trollope's typically restrained Victorian style.

    <summarium>&quot;Half a Century&quot; is the autobiography of Jane Grey Swisshelm (1815-1884), a pioneering American journalist, abolitionist, and women's rights advocate. Published in 1880, this memoir chronicles her experiences in the anti-slavery movement and the Civil War era. Swisshelm was notable as one of the first female newspaper editors and political reporters in the United States. The work provides firsthand accounts of the abolition struggle, hospital conditions during the Civil War, and the social and political battles of mid-19th century America. Her preface explicitly states her purpose: to correct the misconception that the anti-slavery movement originated in infidelity rather than Christian conviction, and to preserve the &quot;inside history&quot; of both the abolition movement and Civil War hospitals for future generations.
</summarium>
    <notae>1880 is the publication year stated on the title page. This is a primary source memoir covering approximately 50 years of the author's life (hence &quot;Half a Century&quot;), likely spanning from around 1830 to 1880. Swisshelm was a complex figure who doesn't fit neatly into modern categories - she was progressive on abolition and women's rights but held other views typical of her era. The work is not classified as 'catholic' despite her Christian framework, as she was Protestant (Presbyterian/Methodist background) and the work doesn't reflect specifically Catholic authorship or perspective.

    <summarium>&quot;The Irrational Knot&quot; is the second novel written by George Bernard Shaw, though it was published much later in 1905. The novel explores themes of marriage, class differences, and social conventions in Victorian England. It tells the story of Edward Conolly, a working-class electrical engineer who marries above his station into the upper classes, and examines the tensions and ultimate breakdown of this &quot;irrational knot&quot; of marriage across class boundaries. The work reflects Shaw's early socialist views and his critique of Victorian marriage conventions and class prejudices. Shaw himself later considered it an immature work, hence his description of it as a novel &quot;of his nonage&quot; (youth/immaturity).
</summarium>
    <notae>Shaw wrote this novel around 1880 (when he was about 24 years old), but it was not published until 1905. The 1880 date represents the original composition, which is more historically significant for understanding Shaw's intellectual development and the Victorian context he was critiquing. The subtitle &quot;Being the Second Novel of His Nonage&quot; was Shaw's own retrospective acknowledgment that this was an early, less mature work.

Kingsley was a prominent figure in Victorian England, known for his social activism (Christian Socialism), his novels (including 'The Water-Babies' and 'Westward Ho!'), and his work as a professor and canon. These essays reflect his engagement with the literary culture of his time and his perspectives on poetry, drama, and the English literary tradition.

    <summarium>This is a collection of short stories by Louisa M. Alcott, author of the beloved &quot;Little Women&quot; series. Originally published under the title &quot;Proverb Stories&quot; in 1882, this collection includes five tales: &quot;Kitty's Class Day,&quot; &quot;Aunt Kipp,&quot; &quot;Psyche's Art,&quot; &quot;A Country Christmas,&quot; and &quot;On Picket Duty.&quot; The preface reveals Alcott's characteristic self-deprecating humor as she describes collecting these &quot;waifs and strays&quot; while forbidden to write new material due to health concerns. She also includes &quot;The Baron's Gloves&quot; (though not listed in this table of contents excerpt) as an example of the &quot;romantic rubbish&quot; she wrote early in her career, offering it as a cautionary example to aspiring young writers. The collection showcases Alcott's range as a storyteller while maintaining her accessible, moralistic style that made her popular with young readers.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1882 is clearly stated as the original publication date in the excerpt. Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) was at the height of her fame during this period, having published &quot;Little Women&quot; in 1868. The preface's mention of being &quot;forbidden to write&quot; reflects Alcott's ongoing health struggles in her later years. While Alcott herself was raised in a transcendentalist household and her personal religious views were complex, her work generally promoted moral values consistent with mainstream Protestant American culture of her time, though she was not Catholic.

    <summarium>&quot;Mr. Scarborough's Family&quot; is one of Anthony Trollope's later novels, published posthumously in 1883. The novel centers on the eccentric Mr. Scarborough, who shocks society by declaring that his eldest son Mountjoy is illegitimate, thus disinheriting him in favor of his younger son Augustus. The story explores themes of family, inheritance, legitimacy, and the moral complexities of a father's manipulation of the law to protect his children. Trollope examines Victorian social conventions and the tangled relationships within the Scarborough family as the truth gradually unfolds. The novel is characteristic of Trollope's later, darker work, dealing with more morally ambiguous characters and situations than his earlier, more optimistic novels.
</summarium>
    <notae>This was Trollope's last completed novel before his death in 1882, published serially in All the Year Round from May 1882 to June 1883, and in book form in 1883. The year 1883 represents both the book publication date and is most historically accurate for cataloging purposes, as this was when it became widely available to readers.

    <summarium>'Contes de la Bécasse' (Tales of the Woodcock) is a collection of short stories by Guy de Maupassant, one of the masters of the French short story form. The collection is framed by a narrative device: a group of hunters gathers at the estate of Baron des Ravots, and each hunter tells a story. The frame story involves the aging baron, now paralyzed and confined to his chair, who still shoots pigeons from his window and loves to hear tales. Maupassant's stories in this collection showcase his characteristic style: sharp psychological insight, irony, and often dark or cynical views of human nature. The tales range from tragic to comic, exploring themes of love, deception, social class, and the human condition in late 19th-century France. Maupassant is considered one of the fathers of the modern short story, and this collection demonstrates his mastery of compressed narrative and his naturalist approach to depicting reality.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1883. This is an original work by Maupassant, not a translation. The Gutenberg text indicates this is the 16th edition published in Paris in 1894, but the original publication date was 1883, which is the historically relevant date for a timeline of literary works. Maupassant (1850-1893) was at the height of his powers in the early 1880s.

    <summarium>'Beacon Lights of History' is a multi-volume series of historical lectures by John Lord (1810-1894), an American historian and lecturer who was enormously popular in the 19th century. Volume I focuses on 'The Old Pagan Civilizations,' examining ancient societies before Christianity. Lord was known for his engaging lecture style that made history accessible to general audiences. His work aimed to illuminate the great figures and movements of history, showing how they shaped civilization. The series was widely used in schools and for self-education in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lord presents history through a Christian lens, interpreting ancient civilizations in light of their relationship to what he saw as the inevitable progress toward Christian civilization.
</summarium>
    <notae>The complete 'Beacon Lights of History' series was published between 1883-1896. Volume I was among the first volumes published around 1883. Lord died in 1894, and some later volumes were completed posthumously. While Lord was a Protestant Christian writing from a Christian worldview, this is not a Catholic work and would not receive a nihil obstat or imprimatur. The work represents 19th-century American Protestant historiography with its characteristic interpretation of history as progressive revelation leading to Christian civilization.

    <summarium>'Twixt France and Spain is a Victorian-era travel narrative by E. Ernest Bilbrough describing his spring journey through the Pyrenees mountain region between France and Spain. The book focuses particularly on the town of Pau and surrounding areas, providing detailed descriptions of hotels, pensions, historical sites (including the castle of Pau and its connection to Henry IV), natural scenery, local customs, and various excursions to nearby locations such as Bétharram, Lescar, and Coarraze. The work is typical of 19th-century travel literature, offering both practical information for travelers and picturesque observations of the landscape, architecture, and local life in this border region.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year is estimated to be around 1883 based on the style and content of Victorian travel literature. The work represents the genre of travel writing popular in the late 19th century when the Pyrenees became an increasingly fashionable destination for British tourists seeking health, scenery, and Continental culture. The book's focus on Pau reflects the town's status as a popular British winter and spring resort during this period.

    <summarium>&quot;Dawn&quot; is H. Rider Haggard's first novel, published in 1884, before he achieved fame with &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; and &quot;She&quot;. It is a three-volume Victorian novel that deals with themes of inheritance, betrayal, love, and redemption. The story follows the fortunes of the Caresfoot family and their estate, involving complex romantic entanglements and moral dilemmas typical of Victorian sensation fiction. Unlike Haggard's later adventure romances set in exotic locales, &quot;Dawn&quot; is set in England and follows the conventions of the domestic novel of the period, though it already shows signs of the dramatic plotting and melodramatic intensity that would characterize his later work.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1884 is straightforward as it appears directly in the text and matches the known publication date of Haggard's debut novel. This work predates his more famous African adventure novels and represents his early attempt at Victorian domestic fiction.

    <summarium>&quot;Työmiehen vaimo&quot; (The Worker's Wife) is a five-act play by Finnish author and playwright Minna Canth, first published and performed in 1885. Canth was a pioneering figure in Finnish literature and theater, known for her realistic depictions of working-class life and her advocacy for social reform, particularly women's rights. This play examines the life of working-class families in 19th century Finland, exploring themes of marriage, poverty, social inequality, and the struggles faced by women in that era. The play opens with a wedding scene (Johanna's wedding to Risto) and follows the couple's life together. Canth was known for her unflinching portrayals of social problems and her plays often sparked public debate about issues such as alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and women's economic dependence on men.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1885 is clearly stated on the title page of this Project Gutenberg text. This is the original publication year of the play. Minna Canth (1844-1897) was one of Finland's most important 19th-century writers and is considered a key figure in the development of Finnish-language literature and realistic drama. While Canth was not a Catholic author (Finland is predominantly Lutheran), this work represents an important piece of Nordic social realist literature.

    <summarium>This is a comprehensive academic survey of modern Western philosophy, tracing its development from the Renaissance philosopher Nicholas of Cusa (15th century) through the late 19th century. Written by German philosopher Richard Falckenberg, Professor at the University of Erlangen, this work was designed as a middle-ground textbook—more detailed than brief compendiums but more accessible than exhaustive multi-volume histories. Falckenberg studied under major German philosophers including Kuno Fischer, Lotze, and J.E. Erdmann, and this work reflects the rigorous German academic tradition of philosophical historiography. The book would have covered major figures like Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, the British empiricists, Kant, and the German idealists, making it a standard reference work for university philosophy students of its era.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year chosen (1886) represents the first German edition publication date, which would precede this 1893 &quot;Third American from the Second German Edition.&quot; This is an original scholarly work rather than a translation of older material, so the original publication date is most historically relevant. The work is not categorized as 'catholic' despite Nicholas of Cusa being a Catholic cardinal, because Falckenberg himself was writing in the German academic tradition of his time, and the work is a scholarly survey rather than a work of Catholic philosophy per se.

    <summarium>&quot;Eine vornehme Frau&quot; (A Distinguished Lady) is a novel by Hermann Heiberg, a Danish-German writer. The work is set in a small German town of about 20,000 inhabitants in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The novel explores themes of social class divisions and the changes that occur when the newly Prussian town receives a military garrison, including hussar squadrons. The narrative examines how the officer families maintain social distance from the townspeople, associating primarily with higher officials and nobility, while the economic impact of the military presence brings prosperity and modernization to the town. The dedication to his mother, Asta (née Countess von Baudissin), suggests semi-autobiographical or observational elements drawn from the author's own experience of German society.

The work tells the story of a young Countess of Waldeck, widowed at thirty-two after her husband fell at Gravelotte in the Franco-Prussian War. Despite controversy over her youth, she becomes the Prioress of the Eisenstein monastery. The narrative focuses on her quiet life at the monastery with her ten-year-old son Otto Heinrich, and her gradual acceptance by the elder ladies of the institution. Herman Bang was a prominent Danish author of the Modern Breakthrough movement, known for his impressionistic prose style and sensitive portrayals of marginalized individuals and quiet suffering.

    <notae>Herman Bang was a Danish author of the late 19th century, part of the Modern Breakthrough literary movement. While he was baptized and raised in a Christian environment, his works are primarily literary fiction rather than explicitly Catholic devotional literature.

    <summarium>This is a literary hoax by Franklin H. Head that presents itself as a scholarly examination of William Shakespeare's supposed insomnia. The work uses the framing device of analyzing fictitious letters to explore the phenomenon of sleeplessness, particularly as it affects men in active professional life past their mid-thirties. While ostensibly about Shakespeare, it appears to be more of a late 19th-century meditation on the modern problem of insomnia, attributing it to the rapid pace of industrial society, telegraphs, railroads, and intense business competition. The work is notable as an example of the &quot;literary hoax&quot; genre popular in the Victorian era, where fictional scholarly works were presented as genuine historical or literary analysis.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1887 is clearly stated on the title page. This work is not appropriate for the 'catholic' tag as Franklin H. Head was not a Catholic author writing from a Catholic perspective. It's also not truly 'appropriate-for-children' as it's a somewhat sophisticated literary hoax dealing with adult themes of professional stress and insomnia. The tag 'literary-hoax' is particularly important here as the work explicitly acknowledges its fictional nature.

The work celebrates Poe as a master of the psychological and the exceptional in moral order, praising his crystalline style and unique temperament.

It was part of the influential 'Story of the Nations' series published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, which aimed to provide accessible national histories for general readers. Lawless, an Anglo-Irish novelist and historian, presents Ireland's complex history including its Celtic origins, Viking invasions, Norman conquest, English colonization, religious conflicts, and the struggle for independence. The work is notable for its attempt at balanced perspective during a contentious period in Irish-British relations. This edition includes additions by Mrs. Arthur Bronson and was dedicated to the Earl of Dufferin, then Viceroy of India.
</summarium>
    <notae>The first edition was published in 1887, though this Project Gutenberg text appears to be from an 1896 edition (as shown on the title page). I've chosen 1887 as the primary date since that represents the original publication and historical context of the work. Emily Lawless (1845-1913) was a significant literary figure of her time, and this was one of her major historical works alongside her novels about Irish life.

    <summarium>Le Horla is a seminal work of psychological horror literature by French author Guy de Maupassant. Written in the form of a diary, the story follows a man who becomes increasingly convinced that an invisible being called &quot;the Horla&quot; is haunting him and slowly taking control of his mind and will. The narrative traces his descent into what may be madness or may be a genuine supernatural encounter. The story is considered a masterpiece of 19th-century horror fiction and a pioneering work in psychological fiction, exploring themes of paranoia, the unconscious mind, and the fragility of human sanity. Maupassant himself suffered from mental illness in his later years, lending the work additional poignancy and authenticity.
</summarium>
    <notae>This is the 1887 version of Le Horla, which is the more famous and developed version. Maupassant wrote an earlier, shorter version in 1886, but the 1887 text is the definitive version that appears in most collections and is the one typically referenced in literary discussions.

    <summarium>Scheherazade (Op. 35) is a symphonic suite composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1888, based on the stories from One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights). The work is one of the most popular pieces of Russian classical music and represents Rimsky-Korsakov's masterful orchestration and use of exotic Eastern themes. The suite tells the framing story of Scheherazade, who saves her life by telling the Sultan captivating stories over 1,001 nights. This Project Gutenberg entry is an audio recording from the Edison National Historic Site, performed by the American Concert Orchestra, representing an early 20th-century recording of this beloved work.
</summarium>
    <notae>While this Project Gutenberg file is a recording edited by Thomas Edison (likely early 1900s), the actual musical composition was written by Rimsky-Korsakov in 1888, which is the historically significant date for the work itself. The composition premiered in St. Petersburg on October 28, 1888. Since this is fundamentally Rimsky-Korsakov's creative work being performed, I've attributed the Year to the original composition date rather than the recording date.

    <summarium>'Contes à la Brune' (Tales to the Brunette) is a collection of romantic tales by French poet and writer Armand Silvestre, featuring illustrations by Kauffmann. The work represents Silvestre's best pages from his 'Pleines Fantaisies' series, combining melancholy and gaiety in stories about love. As Silvestre writes in his dedication, these are love stories that embody both supreme sadness and supreme joy. The collection opens with 'L'Hymne des Brunes' (The Hymn to Brunettes), a response to Catulle Mendès's song praising blondes. Silvestre was a notable figure in late 19th-century French literature, associated with the Parnassian movement and known for his poetry and prose tales.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1888 comes directly from Silvestre's dated dedication ('Juillet 1888'). This represents the original French publication date of this collection.

    <summarium>This is an educational textbook designed for teachers or mothers studying botany with their children. Published in 1888, it represents the pedagogical approach of the late 19th century toward science education. The work focuses on practical, observational learning about plant life, beginning with seeds and progressing through seedlings, roots, and buds. It includes sections on the practical uses of plants (food, clothing, air purification, fuel) and provides detailed instructions for raising seedlings in the classroom. The book emphasizes hands-on learning through the study of common plants like morning-glories, sunflowers, beans, and peas, making botanical concepts accessible to young learners.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1888 is taken directly from the title page. This work is part of the late Victorian era's emphasis on nature study and object-based learning in education. Jane H. Newell was part of a movement to make scientific education more accessible and practical for children, particularly through maternal or home-based instruction.

    <summarium>Frances Hodgson Burnett, best known for 'The Secret Garden' and 'A Little Princess', 
published this collection of four children's stories in 1888. The title story, 'Little Saint Elizabeth', 
tells of a sheltered young girl raised in strict religious devotion by her aunt in France, and explores 
themes of innocence, faith, and encountering the wider world. The collection also includes 'The Story 
of Prince Fairyfoot', 'The Proud Little Grain of Wheat', and 'Behind the White Brick' - fairy tales 
and moral stories typical of Victorian children's literature. Burnett wrote with sympathy for religious 
devotion though she was not Catholic herself.</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1888 represents the first publication of this collection. While Burnett wrote 
many works over decades, this specific collection was published in 1888. The story 'Little Saint Elizabeth' 
depicts Catholic devotional life sympathetically but this is not a 'catholic' tagged work since Burnett 
was not a Catholic author and the work would not have received nihil obstat/imprimatur. It is, however, 
entirely appropriate for children as it was written specifically for young readers.</notae>

    <summarium>&quot;Grass of Parnassus: Rhymes Old and New&quot; is a collection of poetry by Andrew Lang, the Scottish poet, novelist, literary critic, and anthropologist. Published in 1888 by Longmans, Green and Co., this volume contains a selection of Lang's verse both new and previously published. Lang was a prolific Victorian man of letters known for his work in folklore, mythology, and his popular &quot;Coloured&quot; Fairy Books series. His poetry reflects the aesthetic and literary sensibilities of the late Victorian period, often drawing on classical themes and romantic traditions. The title itself references Mount Parnassus, the legendary home of the Muses in Greek mythology, suggesting the poetic and literary aspirations of the collection.

    <summarium>A Beautiful Possibility is a romantic adventure novel set in the West Indies. The story centers around Lenox Hildreth, a cultured New England naturalist who has relocated to a West Indian island villa due to health concerns (pulmonary issues). The novel follows the typical conventions of late 19th-century American romantic fiction, featuring exotic tropical settings, dramatic confrontations, and likely themes of romance and adventure characteristic of the period's popular literature.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year is somewhat uncertain, but based on the writing style, conventions, and the author's active period, 1889 is the most likely publication date. This work represents typical sensationalist American fiction of the late Victorian era.

    <summarium>The Winning of the West is Theodore Roosevelt's comprehensive four-volume history of the American frontier, examining the westward expansion of English-speaking peoples across the Appalachian Mountains and into the trans-Allegheny region. Volume One covers the period from 1769 to 1776, focusing on the early pioneers who crossed the Alleghanies and established settlements in what would become Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Ohio Valley. Roosevelt traces the conflicts with Native American tribes, the struggles of frontier life, and the character of the backwoodsmen who opened the West. The work is notable for Roosevelt's vivid prose and his thesis that westward expansion was part of a larger historical pattern of English-speaking peoples' expansion across continents. Written before his presidency, this work established Roosevelt as a serious historian and reflects his views on American exceptionalism, frontier spirit, and nation-building.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1889, when Roosevelt was just 30 years old. The complete four-volume series was published between 1889-1896. This work was one of Roosevelt's major intellectual achievements before entering politics at the highest levels, and it reveals much about his philosophy of American history and character. The dedication to Francis Parkman, the great American historian of the frontier and French-Indian conflicts, shows Roosevelt's debt to earlier frontier historiography.

    <summarium>A comprehensive textbook on American civil government written by philosopher and historian John Fiske. The work examines the structure and origins of government in the United States, from local town and county governments through state and federal institutions. Fiske traces the historical development of American governmental institutions back to their Anglo-Saxon and colonial roots. The book was widely used as a civics textbook in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and represents an important contribution to American political education during the post-Civil War era. Fiske approaches the subject from a historical-evolutionary perspective, showing how American institutions developed organically from earlier forms of government.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year of 1890 is clearly stated in the text itself. This work was published during the height of Fiske's career as a historian and was part of the late 19th century movement to create systematic civics education in American schools. The book is not tagged as 'catholic' as Fiske was not a Catholic author and his philosophical approach was influenced by evolutionary naturalism rather than Catholic thought.

    <summarium>This is a late 19th-century travel guide describing tourist sights and scenes in the Pacific Northwest territories of Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. E. L. Lomax was associated with railroad promotion literature, and works like this were commonly published to encourage tourism and settlement in the American West during the era of railroad expansion. The book would have provided practical information and romantic descriptions to entice tourists to visit these regions during a period of rapid development and before Alaska achieved statehood (1959) or even territorial status with full civil government.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year is not stated in the provided text, but based on the style, subject matter, and E. L. Lomax's known activity as a passenger agent for Union Pacific Railroad publishing promotional travel literature in the 1880s-1890s, this work most likely dates to approximately 1890. Travel guides of this type were particularly popular during the 1880s-1900s period when transcontinental railroad travel made the Pacific Northwest newly accessible to tourists from the eastern United States.

    <summarium>This is an audio recording of a Polish national dance performed by violinist Charles D'Almaine, edited by Thomas Edison. The recording was taken from the Edison National Historic Site and represents one of the early audio recordings made during Edison's phonograph era. Polish national dances typically refer to mazurkas, polonaises, or krakowiak dances that were popular in classical and folk music traditions.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact year is difficult to determine from this text alone. Charles D'Almaine (1840-1904) was a prominent violinist who worked with Edison's recording projects in the 1890s. Edison's phonograph recordings began in the late 1870s-1880s, with commercial production ramping up in the 1890s. Given D'Almaine's career and Edison's recording timeline, circa 1890 seems a reasonable estimate for when this recording was likely made, though it could range from 1880s-early 1900s. This is an audio artifact rather than a written text, representing early recording technology history.

    <summarium>&quot;L'inutile Beauté&quot; (Useless Beauty) is a collection of short stories by French author Guy de Maupassant, published in 1890, one of his final works before his mental decline. The collection includes several of Maupassant's later stories that showcase his mature style and often darker, more psychologically complex themes. The title story explores themes of beauty, vanity, marriage, and the relationships between men and women in bourgeois society. Maupassant was a master of the short story form and this collection demonstrates his skill at portraying human nature with both cynicism and compassion. His works often examined the social dynamics of late 19th-century France, particularly focusing on the middle and upper classes.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year 1890 is clearly stated on the title page. This was published near the end of Maupassant's career - he would begin suffering from syphilis-related mental illness in 1891 and died in 1893. Maupassant was not a Catholic author and his works often contained themes and content that would not receive ecclesiastical approval, so the 'catholic' tag is not applicable.

    <summarium>A collection of letters by Horace Walpole (1717-1797), edited by Charles Duke Yonge. Walpole was an English writer, art historian, politician, and son of Britain's first Prime Minister. His extensive correspondence provides invaluable firsthand accounts of 18th-century English society, politics, culture, and notable events. Volume I covers letters from 1736-1764, including correspondence with friends like Montagu, discussing everything from royal marriages to travel plans and social observations. Walpole's letters are considered among the finest in English literature for their wit, detail, and historical significance.
</summarium>
    <notae>The letters themselves were written between 1736-1764 (and beyond in other volumes), but this is an edited collection published in 1890. I chose 1890 as the year because this represents the editorial work as published, rather than the dates of the original correspondence. This edition by Charles Duke Yonge was a significant scholarly compilation of Walpole's vast correspondence.

    <summarium>This is an issue of Punch, the famous British weekly magazine of humor and satire that was published from 1841 to 1992. Punch was known for its political satire, cartoons, and humorous commentary on Victorian and later British society. This particular issue from July 12, 1890 (Volume 99) includes the recurring feature &quot;Voces Populi&quot; (Voices of the People), which presented humorous sketches of overheard conversations in various public settings. In this case, the scene is set at a Military Exhibition, capturing the dialogue of ordinary Londoners attending the event. Punch was enormously influential in British culture and is credited with coining many phrases and establishing the conventions of political cartooning.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1890 is the publication date of this specific issue. Punch magazine was a periodical, so each issue has its own distinct publication date. &quot;Various&quot; is used for the author since Punch was a collaborative effort with multiple contributors, though specific pieces may have had individual authors (often writing under pseudonyms). The magazine was generally family-friendly for Victorian standards, hence the &quot;appropriate-for-children&quot; tag.

    <summarium>This is an audio recording by Thomas A. Edison, the famous American inventor. Edison not only invented the phonograph but also created numerous experimental recordings in the late 19th century. &quot;The Liver Complaint Story&quot; appears to be one of these early phonograph recordings, likely a humorous or commercial narrative recorded on Edison's sound recording equipment. This represents an important piece of early audio technology history, demonstrating the commercial and entertainment applications of Edison's phonograph invention.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact recording date is uncertain from this Project Gutenberg metadata. Edison's phonograph was invented in 1877, and commercial recordings became more common in the 1890s. Without access to the actual audio content or Edison National Historic Site records, I've estimated circa 1890 as a reasonable approximation for when such commercial/entertainment recordings were being produced. The actual recording could date anywhere from the late 1880s to early 1900s during Edison's active period of phonograph development and commercial recording production.

    <summarium>'Without Dogma' is a psychological novel by Nobel Prize-winning Polish author Henryk Sienkiewicz, presented as the diary of Leon Płoszowski, a wealthy, overeducated Polish aristocrat suffering from excessive skepticism and inability to commit to beliefs or action. Unlike Sienkiewicz's famous historical epics ('Quo Vadis', 'The Trilogy'), this is a modern psychological study exploring themes of paralysis by analysis, the crisis of faith in the late 19th century, and the dangers of excessive intellectualism without moral grounding. The protagonist represents the spiritual malaise of the modern educated European who, having questioned all dogmas and traditions, finds himself unable to act or love decisively. It's considered one of Sienkiewicz's most philosophically profound works, and reflects Catholic concerns about the corrosive effects of radical skepticism and relativism on the soul.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was originally published in Polish in 1891. This translation by Iza Young appeared in 1893. I chose 1891 as it represents the original publication date of the work itself. Sienkiewicz was a devout Catholic, and while this novel is a psychological portrait rather than explicitly religious literature, it carries strong Catholic philosophical underpinnings in its critique of moral relativism and dogma-less existence. The work would likely have received ecclesiastical approval given its moral framework, though it deals with mature themes of existential crisis unsuitable for children.

    <summarium>&quot;Virgie's Inheritance&quot; is a novel by Mrs. Georgie Sheldon, a popular American author of domestic fiction in the late 19th century. Sheldon (born Sarah Elizabeth Forbush Downs, 1843-1926) was known for her sentimental novels aimed at young readers, particularly girls. Her works typically featured virtuous heroines facing adversity and moral challenges. This novel appears to follow a young woman named Virgie whose father is dying from illness and must make provisions for her future before his death. The story likely explores themes of perseverance, virtue, and eventual triumph over hardship that were characteristic of Sheldon's work and popular in late Victorian-era domestic fiction.
</summarium>
    <notae>The copyright dates listed are 1887, 1888, and 1891. I chose 1891 as it represents the most complete published version. This work is typical of the &quot;girls' fiction&quot; genre popular in America during the Gilded Age, featuring moral instruction wrapped in entertaining narratives. While wholesome and appropriate for children, this is not a Catholic work - Sheldon wrote popular Protestant-influenced domestic fiction for the American market.

    <summarium>&quot;Darkest India&quot; is a social reform treatise written by Salvation Army Commissioner Frederick Booth-Tucker as a companion volume to General William Booth's influential work &quot;In Darkest England and the Way Out.&quot; The book applies General Booth's social salvation principles to the Indian context, arguing that if England's poor deserve a &quot;cabhorse charter&quot; (basic standards of living comparable to those afforded to cab horses), then India's impoverished masses deserve a &quot;bullock charter.&quot; Booth-Tucker examines poverty, social conditions, and the need for systematic relief efforts in British India, proposing adaptations of the Salvation Army's social welfare model to address India's unique circumstances. The work represents an early example of Christian social gospel thinking applied to colonial India's social problems.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1891 is taken from the publication date listed in the preface. This work was written shortly after William Booth's &quot;In Darkest England&quot; (1890) and represents the Salvation Army's extension of its social reform mission to India. Frederick Booth-Tucker (1853-1929) was a British Salvation Army commissioner who served extensively in India and married William Booth's daughter Emma. Not tagged as 'catholic' as this is a Protestant/Salvation Army work, though it shares social reform concerns common to Christian social teaching of the period.

    <summarium>The Great Shadow is a historical novel by Arthur Conan Doyle set during the Napoleonic Wars. The 'shadow' refers to the looming threat of Napoleon Bonaparte over Britain during the early 19th century. The main story follows a young Scottish boy's coming of age against the backdrop of the Napoleonic threat, culminating in the Battle of Waterloo. The book includes other Napoleonic tales featuring Conan Doyle's character Brigadier Gerard, a humorous French cavalry officer. Written during Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes era, it demonstrates his versatility as a writer and his interest in historical fiction. The work combines adventure, romance, and historical detail in an accessible narrative style suitable for younger readers while still engaging adults.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1892. While Conan Doyle was born into a Catholic family and educated at Stonyhenge preparatory school and Stonyhurst College (both Jesuit institutions), he later became agnostic, so I have not included the 'catholic' tag. The work itself is adventure fiction without particular religious content, though it reflects Victorian-era British values and patriotism. The Brigadier Gerard stories became some of Conan Doyle's personal favorites among his own works.

    <summarium>A lighthearted epistolary novel presented as extracts from the commonplace book of Penelope Hamilton, chronicling the adventures of American women traveling through England. The book is divided into two parts: experiences in London and experiences in the English countryside. Written with gentle humor and keen observation, Wiggin captures the cultural differences between Americans and the English through the eyes of her protagonist. The work belongs to the popular late 19th-century genre of American travel literature focused on England, combining social commentary with entertaining anecdotes about English customs, society, and daily life. Kate Douglas Wiggin was a beloved American author and kindergarten pioneer, best known for 'Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.'
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1893. This was Wiggin's first adult novel and proved quite popular, leading to sequels 'Penelope's Irish Experiences' (1901) and 'Penelope's Postscripts' (1915). The book reflects the late Victorian era's fascination with transatlantic cultural comparisons and the 'American abroad' literary tradition.

    <summarium>This is an educational anthology designed as a companion volume to the Riverside Primer and Reader. Published in 1893, it contains selections of verse and prose from English and American literature specifically chosen for beginning readers. The book consists primarily of poetry (nine-tenths of the content) with the remainder being proverbs and familiar sayings. It was intended to bridge the gap between basic reading instruction and the world of English literature, serving as an early reader for students who had mastered their primer. The work is part of the Riverside Literature Series, a prominent educational publishing initiative of the late 19th century.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1893 is taken directly from the title page. This is an anthology compiled for educational purposes, so &quot;Various&quot; is appropriate for the author field as it contains selections from multiple English and American authors. The work represents the pedagogical approach to reading instruction common in American schools during the late 19th century.

    <summarium>'Les Demi-Vierges' (The Half-Virgins) is a controversial novel by French writer Marcel Prévost that examines the behavior and moral condition of young women in late 19th-century Parisian high society. The work critiques what Prévost saw as a dangerous new type of young woman who, while technically maintaining virginity, engaged in flirtatious behavior and worldly sophistication that contradicted traditional Catholic ideals of feminine purity. The novel sparked significant debate in its time about female education, morality, and the institution of Christian marriage. Prévost was concerned about the influence of Anglo-Saxon 'flirting' culture on French society and argued that modern education was creating young women incompatible with traditional Christian marriage. The preface (included in this text) defends his observations and clarifies that he was describing a specific minority within the Parisian leisure class, not all French women.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was first published in 1894 and became one of Marcel Prévost's most famous and controversial works. It was initially serialized in a Parisian magazine before book publication. While Prévost was a French Catholic writer, this particular work's provocative subject matter and the moral concerns it addresses would likely have been considered controversial even within Catholic circles, thus it may not have received official ecclesiastical approval (nihil obstat/imprimatur). The work is more of a social critique with Catholic moral framework rather than devotional literature.

    <summarium>This is part of James D. Richardson's monumental compilation of presidential messages and papers, commissioned by Congress. This particular volume covers Thomas Jefferson's presidency from March 4, 1801 to March 4, 1809. The work includes biographical information about Jefferson, his official messages to Congress, proclamations, executive orders, and other presidential papers. Richardson's compilation was the first comprehensive collection of presidential documents and became a standard reference work for American historical and political research. The text begins with a biographical sketch of Jefferson, detailing his birth at Shadwell in 1743, his education at William and Mary, his role in drafting the Declaration of Independence, his governorship of Virginia, and his diplomatic service in France before becoming the first Secretary of State under Washington and eventually the third President.
</summarium>
    <notae>The original compilation was published in multiple volumes between 1896-1899. While this appears in Project Gutenberg as ebook #10893, the year 1896 represents when Richardson's compilation work was first published by authority of Congress.

    <summarium>'Cap and Gown' is an anthology of college verse compiled by Frederic Lawrence Knowles in 1897. The collection focuses on light, humorous poetry celebrating undergraduate life - themes of youth, joy, and love from a student's perspective. Knowles, who also edited 'The Golden Treasury of American Songs and Lyrics,' dedicated this work to Francis James Child, the renowned Harvard scholar and collector of English and Scottish ballads. The prefatory note makes clear that these verses are not meant to be taken too seriously - they don't aspire to epic or heroic poetry, but rather capture the spirit and experiences of college life in late 19th century America.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1897 is straightforward as it appears on the title page. Francis James Child (1825-1896), to whom this is dedicated, was the distinguished Harvard professor famous for his collection 'The English and Scottish Popular Ballads.' The dedication's past tense ('whom I was once proud to call my friend') suggests Child had recently died when this was published, which aligns with the 1897 publication date.

    <summarium>&quot;Studies in Civics&quot; is an American educational textbook designed to teach students about the structure and function of government in the United States. Written by James T. McCleary, a teacher of civics and history at the State Normal School in Mankato, Minnesota, the work provides a comprehensive examination of American governmental institutions. The book includes a detailed study of the U.S. Constitution and covers various levels of government, starting with local town government and progressing to broader governmental concepts. McCleary's pedagogical approach, developed over eighteen years of teaching experience, emphasizes beginning with observable local institutions before moving to more abstract concepts. The work is part of the &quot;American Educational Series&quot; and was specifically designed for classroom use, with reference materials organized in an appendix for easy access.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1897 is indicated as the revision date on the title page. While there may have been an earlier edition, 1897 represents the published version described in this text. This was during a period of significant growth in civic education in American schools, and normal schools (teacher training institutions) were important centers for developing pedagogical methods for teaching citizenship and government.

    <summarium>A collection of essays by Alice Meynell, the acclaimed Victorian-era Catholic poet, essayist, and suffragist. The volume contains ten contemplative essays on various subjects including nature, art, biography, and mortality. Meynell was known for her refined prose style and ability to find profound meaning in everyday observations. Topics range from meditations on clouds, winds, and grasses to reflections on the actress Eleonora Duse and visits to monastery gates. Her writing combines aesthetic sensitivity with spiritual depth, characteristic of her position as one of the leading Catholic literary figures of her time.

    <notae>Using 1897 as the publication year based on the transcription note indicating this was transcribed from the &quot;1897 John Lane edition.&quot; Alice Meynell (1847-1922) was a prominent Catholic convert and her work was widely respected in Catholic literary circles. Her essays often reflect contemplative and spiritual themes consistent with her faith, making the 'catholic' tag appropriate. The work is suitable for older children and adults given its contemplative, non-controversial nature.

    <summarium>'The Romance of Zion Chapel' is a novel by Richard Le Gallienne that satirizes late Victorian English Nonconformist chapel culture. The story follows Theophil Flowers, a young man raised in the rigid environment of a dissenting chapel in the fictional town of Coalchester, who becomes torn between his religious upbringing and his growing attraction to art, beauty, and the Aesthetic movement. The novel explores themes of provincial narrowness versus cosmopolitan sophistication, religious constraint versus artistic freedom, and includes a romantic subplot involving the character Jenny. It's characteristic of 1890s literature with its focus on aestheticism and critique of middle-class morality.
</summarium>
    <notae>Publication date of 1898 is clearly stated on the title page. Le Gallienne was not a Catholic author - he came from a Nonconformist Protestant background and was associated with the Aesthetic movement. This work satirizes Protestant chapel culture rather than representing Catholic thought, so 'catholic' tag is not applicable.

    <summarium>Collections and Recollections is a collection of essays and reminiscences by George William Erskine Russell (1853-1919), a British Liberal politician, social reformer, and author. The work contains anecdotes, observations, and recollections of Victorian society, political life, and notable personalities of the era. Russell was known for his wit, charm, and ability to capture the social atmosphere of late 19th-century England. The book was originally written at the suggestion of James Payn, the novelist and editor, to whom it was dedicated. Payn died in March 1898, the same year the book was first published. The work provides valuable insights into Victorian social customs, political culture, and the literary world of the period.</summarium>
    <notae>The dedication indicates James Payn died March 25, 1898, and mentions the papers were written at his suggestion and inscribed to him. This strongly suggests 1898 as the original publication year. The preface mentions &quot;when the book first appeared&quot; and references to &quot;this Edition&quot; suggest there were multiple editions. Russell was Anglo-Catholic in his religious views and a social reformer, but this particular work is primarily social commentary and reminiscences rather than explicitly religious content, so I have not tagged it as 'catholic' despite the author's religious background.</notae>

    <summarium>This is Volume III of Temple Scott's edited collection of Jonathan Swift's prose works, specifically focusing on Swift's writings on religion and the Church. Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was an Anglo-Irish satirist, essayist, political pamphleteer, poet, and Anglican cleric who became Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. This volume compiles his various writings on religious matters and Church governance, edited by Temple Scott with a biographical introduction by W.E.H. Lecky. Swift was known for his sharp wit and incisive commentary on both religious and political matters of his time. As an Anglican cleric, his religious writings would have been from a Protestant perspective during a period of significant religious and political tension in Ireland and England.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1898 represents the publication date of this edited collection by Temple Scott, published as part of Bohn's Standard Library. While Swift's original writings on religion and the Church would have been composed during his lifetime (late 17th/early 18th century), this is specifically an edited compilation, so 1898 is the most historically accurate date for this particular work. The individual texts within this volume would have been written by Swift between approximately 1690s-1740s, but as a collected scholarly edition, 1898 is the appropriate year.

Note: Not tagged as 'catholic' since Swift was an Anglican cleric, not Catholic. Not tagged 'appropriate-for-children' as Swift's religious and political writings were intended for educated adult audiences and dealt with complex theological and ecclesiastical matters.

    <summarium>&quot;Tales of Unrest&quot; is Joseph Conrad's first collection of short stories, published in 1898. The collection contains five stories: &quot;Karain: A Memory,&quot; &quot;The Idiots,&quot; &quot;An Outpost of Progress,&quot; &quot;The Return,&quot; and &quot;The Lagoon.&quot; These stories showcase Conrad's transition from his Malayan phase (evident in earlier novels like &quot;Almayer's Folly&quot; and &quot;An Outcast of the Islands&quot;) and demonstrate his developing mastery of the short story form. The collection explores themes of isolation, moral corruption, psychological distress, and the clash between Western and non-Western cultures. &quot;The Lagoon&quot; was actually Conrad's first short story, though it appears last in the collection. The stories vary in setting from Malayan landscapes to European contexts, reflecting Conrad's wide-ranging maritime experiences and his deep interest in human psychology under extreme conditions.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1898 is the first publication date of &quot;Tales of Unrest&quot; as a collection. While &quot;The Lagoon&quot; was written earlier (around 1896-1897) and some stories appeared in magazines before book publication, 1898 represents the historical publication of this complete work. Conrad was still early in his literary career at this point, having only published two novels before this story collection.

in 'St. Nicholas' magazine (a popular children's periodical of the era), with \
approximately half appearing there before the complete version was published in book \
form. It exemplifies the late 19th-century genre of wholesome boys' fiction that \
emphasized sportsmanship, camaraderie, and character development through athletic \
competition and school life.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1899 is taken directly from the title page. Rupert Hughes (1872-1956) was an \
American novelist, film director, and composer—not a Catholic author. While the book \
would be considered generally wholesome and appropriate for children of the era, it \
does not qualify for the 'catholic' tag as it is secular boys' fiction without \
religious content or a Catholic author perspective.

    <summarium>Frank Merriwell's Nobility is part of the extensive Frank Merriwell series - one of the most successful dime novel series in American publishing history. Written by Gilbert Patten under the pseudonym Burt L. Standish, these stories followed the adventures of Frank Merriwell, an idealized American hero who embodied courage, sportsmanship, and moral virtue. The series ran from 1896-1913 in Tip Top Weekly magazine and was enormously popular with young male readers. Frank Merriwell became a cultural icon representing the ideal of the &quot;muscular Christian&quot; gentleman-athlete. This particular story, 'The Tragedy of the Ocean Tramp,' involves seafaring adventure and was published in the weekly serialized format that made the series famous. The stories typically combined sports, adventure, and moral lessons in an accessible, exciting format.

The novel follows the Froment family through multiple generations, celebrating fertility, family life, and colonization as means of national regeneration. It represents Zola's mature philosophical vision and his attempt to offer positive solutions after the darker naturalist works of his earlier career. The work is part of his transition from the pessimistic determinism of the Rougon-Macquart cycle to a more optimistic, reformist vision for society.
</summarium>
    <notae>1899 is the year of original French publication. The English translation by Ernest Alfred Vizetelly followed shortly after (1900 edition shown in this text). This novel came during Zola's later 'evangelical' period and represents a significant shift from his earlier naturalist works. While Zola himself was not Catholic (he was anti-clerical and associated with secular republicanism), this work does not receive a 'catholic' tag despite its pro-natalist themes, as it approaches the subject from a secular, social-reform perspective rather than from Catholic doctrine.

    <summarium>Part of &quot;The Little Colonel&quot; series by Annie Fellows Johnston, this children's novel is set in Kentucky and follows the adventures of young characters in Lloydsborough Valley. The story takes place during a particularly cold winter and involves various adventures including encounters with tramps and a bear, a Valentine's party, and other episodic adventures typical of wholesome American children's literature of the late Victorian era. The series was immensely popular in its time and portrayed idealized Southern life and childhood adventures with moral lessons appropriate for young readers.

    <summarium>'Femmes rêvées' (Dreamed Women) is a poetry collection by French-Canadian poet Albert Ferland, published with a preface by Louis Fréchette, a lauréat of the French Academy. The work explores themes of love, beauty, dreams, and idealized femininity. Fréchette's preface praises the modest and artistic quality of the work, noting that Ferland takes a restrained approach to sentimentality compared to poets like Alfred de Musset, avoiding excessive personal confession. The collection represents part of the literary tradition of late 19th-century Quebec poetry, focusing on aesthetic beauty and the intersection of art, youth, and romantic idealization.

    <notae>The year 1899 is clearly marked in the original publication as MDCCCXCIX. This work is part of the French-Canadian literary tradition and would have been published in Quebec. Not tagged as 'appropriate-for-children' as it is romantic poetry for adults. Not tagged as 'catholic' despite the Quebec context, as the preface and excerpts focus on romantic and aesthetic themes rather than explicitly Catholic content.

    <summarium>'More Fables' is a collection of humorous fables by George Ade, a follow-up to his successful 'Fables in Slang' (1899). Ade was an American writer and humorist known for his satirical fables written in colloquial American English of the early 20th century. His fables typically lampooned American social types and pretensions with wit and clever wordplay. The stories featured capitalized nouns and used vernacular speech to comment on modern American life, including topics like social climbers, marriage, business, and cultural trends. Ade's work was extremely popular in its time and influenced American humor writing. The fables are lighthearted moral tales with a distinctly American flavor, often ending with a humorous &quot;moral&quot; in the tradition of Aesop but applied to contemporary American society.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1900 is indicated directly in the text. This appears to be the original publication date. George Ade (1866-1944) was not Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag is not applied. The fables are generally appropriate for children in terms of moral content, though they satirize adult social situations. Illustrated by Clyde J. Newman.

    <summarium>This is an early audio recording from the Edison Historic National Site, performed by the Peerless Orchestra. &quot;Ma Rag Time Baby&quot; is a ragtime composition, representing the popular music genre that dominated American entertainment from roughly 1895-1919. Ragtime was characterized by its syncopated or &quot;ragged&quot; rhythm and was a precursor to jazz. The Peerless Orchestra was a recording ensemble that made numerous recordings for Thomas Edison's phonograph company in the early 1900s. This Project Gutenberg entry is an MP3 digitization of the original Edison cylinder or disc recording.
</summarium>
    <notae>Dating early audio recordings can be imprecise, but ragtime's peak popularity was 1899-1910. The Peerless Orchestra was most active in the 1900s-1910s recording for Edison. Without access to the actual audio or more metadata, I've estimated circa 1900 as representative of the ragtime era and early Edison recording period. The actual recording could be anywhere from 1898-1915. This is primarily a historical artifact rather than a literary work - it's an audio recording, not a text.

    <summarium>&quot;La Tête de Martin&quot; is a one-act comedy originally written by French playwrights E. Grangé, Decourcelle, and Th. Barrière. This particular edition was adapted for youth theater circles (&quot;cercles de jeunes gens&quot;) by Régis Roy and published in Montreal in 1900 by C.O. Beauchemin &amp; Fils. The play features four characters and takes place in a furnished hotel (&quot;hôtel garni&quot;). As a light comedy adapted specifically for young people, it represents the popular French theatrical tradition of the late 19th century being adapted for French-Canadian audiences.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1900 as the year because this is the date of the Régis Roy adaptation published in Montreal, which is the specific edition in this Project Gutenberg text. The original French play by Grangé, Decourcelle, and Barrière would have been written earlier (likely mid-to-late 19th century), but since this is a distinct adaptation &quot;arrangée pour cercles de jeunes gens&quot; with a specific publication date, the 1900 date seems most appropriate for this edition. The adaptation was likely made more appropriate for youth audiences than the original.

    <summarium>This is the text of the Romanes Lecture delivered by James A.H. Murray at Oxford University on June 22, 1900. Murray, the principal editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, provides a scholarly examination of the history and development of English lexicography. The lecture traces the evolution of dictionary-making in England, discussing various lexicographers and their methods, including Dr. Johnson. Murray uses his deep expertise to illuminate how English dictionaries developed over time and the challenges inherent in capturing and defining a living language. The work is both a historical survey and a meditation on the nature of lexicographical work itself.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year is straightforward as this was delivered and published in 1900. James A.H. Murray (1837-1915) was the primary editor of the Oxford English Dictionary and one of the most important lexicographers in history. The Romanes Lecture is a prestigious annual lecture series established at Oxford in 1892. This is an academic lecture, not appropriate for children due to its specialized scholarly nature. Not tagged as 'catholic' as Murray was Scottish Presbyterian, though he was a deeply learned and principled scholar.

The work represents the literary traditions of the region extending from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean, encompassing the cultural heritage of the Berbers, Arabs, and Spanish Muslims who were collectively known as Moors.

    <summarium>Ten Girls from Dickens is a compilation work by Kate Dickinson Sweetser that extracts and presents the stories of ten memorable female characters from Charles Dickens' novels as standalone narratives. The book features beloved characters such as Little Nell (from The Old Curiosity Shop), The Marchioness (also from The Old Curiosity Shop), Jenny Wren (from Our Mutual Friend), and Florence Dombey (from Dombey and Son). This work was designed as a companion volume to Sweetser's 'Ten Boys from Dickens' and was intended to make Dickens' complex novels more accessible to younger readers by presenting character-focused narratives in a simplified format. The book was illustrated by George Alfred Williams and represents the early 20th century educational practice of introducing children to classic literature through character studies and abridged versions.</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1901 is based on typical publication dates for Kate Dickinson Sweetser's Dickens compilation series. These works were published in the early 1900s as part of the movement to make classic literature accessible to children. While I cannot see the exact copyright date in this excerpt, Sweetser's 'Ten Boys from Dickens' was published around 1901, and this companion volume would have followed shortly after. This is not a work by Dickens himself but rather a secondary work about Dickens' characters, so the year reflects Sweetser's publication date rather than Dickens' original works (which span 1836-1870).</notae>

    <summarium>An early automobile travelogue published in 1902, documenting a pioneering journey of over two thousand miles through New England, New York, Canada, and the American West. Written under the pseudonym &quot;Chauffeur,&quot; this work captures the adventure and novelty of long-distance automobile travel in the very early days of the automotive age, when such journeys were still rare and challenging undertakings. The narrative is described as &quot;desultory&quot; (rambling or digressive), suggesting an informal, conversational style. The book includes eighteen illustrations by Frank Verbeck and is dedicated to &quot;L. O. E.&quot; who accompanied the author for much of the journey.

    <summarium>'At Sunwich Port' is a humorous novel by W. W. Jacobs set in an English seaside town. The story revolves around Captain Nugent, his son's impending marriage, and the persistent visits of Jem Hardy, who appears to be pursuing some undisclosed objective despite the captain's resistance. Jacobs is known for his light comedic touch and vivid characterizations of English working-class and maritime life. This work exemplifies his skill at depicting the social dynamics and comic misunderstandings of small-town life, with particular attention to stubborn sea captains and the romantic entanglements of their families. The novel was illustrated by Will Owen, whose drawings complemented Jacobs's narrative style.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1902. W. W. Jacobs was a popular author of his era, and while he was English and writing in the Edwardian period, there's no indication this is a specifically Catholic work. The 'appropriate-for-children' tag applies as Jacobs's humor was generally wholesome and his novels were suitable family reading of the period.

    <summarium>This is a collection of short stories by British author William Wymark Jacobs, best known for containing &quot;The Monkey's Paw,&quot; one of the most famous horror short stories in English literature. &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; tells the tale of a family who receives a magical talisman that grants three wishes, but with terrible and ironic consequences. The story has become a classic cautionary tale about being careful what you wish for. Jacobs was primarily known for his humorous stories about sailors and dock workers, but &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; represents his venture into supernatural horror and has become his most enduring work. The collection includes other stories featuring maritime themes and everyday English life at the turn of the 20th century.
</summarium>
    <notae>The Lady of the Barge and Other Stories was first published in 1902 by Harper &amp; Brothers. &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; appeared in this collection and was also published separately in the same year. While some of Jacobs' humorous maritime stories might contain mild content, &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; deals with death and supernatural horror in a way that is frightening but not graphically violent, making it generally considered appropriate for older children and commonly taught in schools.

    <summarium>'Beacon Lights of History' is a comprehensive lecture series by American historian John Lord (1810-1894), covering major figures and movements in Western civilization. Volume X focuses on European leaders of the 19th century, particularly British political figures during the reform era. This volume examines the period of William IV's reign and the subsequent reform movements, including the Great Reform Act of 1832, the abolition of slavery, and the repeal of the Corn Laws. Lord covers key statesmen like Lord Grey, Sir Robert Peel, Lord Melbourne, and the Duke of Wellington. The series was hugely popular in its time as public lectures and later as published volumes, known for making history accessible and morally instructive to general audiences.
</summarium>
    <notae>Dating this work requires some explanation. John Lord delivered these lectures throughout the 1870s-1880s and died in 1894. However, the complete 15-volume series 'Beacon Lights of History' was published posthumously, with later volumes edited and compiled after his death. Volume X specifically was published around 1902. Since this is a historical work about 19th century figures rather than a primary source from that period, I've chosen 1902 as the most historically accurate publication date. This distinguishes it from the events it describes (1830s-1840s) and represents when this particular volume became available to readers.

    <summarium>'The Lady of the Barge and Other Stories' is a collection of short stories by English humorist and author W. W. Jacobs, first published in 1902. The collection is perhaps best known for containing 'The Monkey's Paw,' one of the most famous horror stories in English literature. However, most stories in the collection are humorous tales about sailormen and dockside life, written in Jacobs' characteristic style featuring working-class vernacular dialogue and gentle comedy. 'Bill's Paper Chase' is one of these lighter nautical tales, featuring the night watchman narrator who appears in many of Jacobs' stories, recounting humorous anecdotes about sailors and their adventures.
</summarium>
    <notae>1902 is the original publication date of 'The Lady of the Barge and Other Stories' collection. W. W. Jacobs (1863-1943) was a prolific writer of humorous short stories, primarily about dockworkers and sailors in London. While the collection contains the famous Gothic horror tale 'The Monkey's Paw,' most stories like this one are light comedic pieces appropriate for general audiences.

    <summarium>A collection of short stories by English author W. W. Jacobs, first published in 1902. The collection includes both humorous tales and the famous supernatural horror story &quot;The Monkey's Paw.&quot; Jacobs was known for his witty, character-driven narratives often set in English villages and along the Thames waterfront. His stories typically feature working-class characters and gentle comedy of manners, though &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; stands out as a darker work exploring themes of fate and the dangers of interfering with destiny. The title story and others in the collection showcase Jacobs' skill at combining humor with elements of romance and mystery.
</summarium>
    <notae>1902 is the original publication year for this collection. W. W. Jacobs (William Wymark Jacobs, 1863-1943) was not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag is not included. Most of the stories are appropriate for children, featuring gentle humor and mild adventure, though &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; has some darker themes that might be intense for very young readers.

    <summarium>'The Grip of Desire' (French: 'L'Étreinte du Désir') is a controversial novel by Hector France subtitled 'The Story of a Parish-Priest'. The novel deals with the struggles of a Catholic priest with celibacy and sexual desire. France was a French journalist and author known for his anti-clerical works in the late 19th/early 20th century. This work was considered scandalous at the time of publication for its frank treatment of priestly sexuality and its critique of Catholic clerical celibacy requirements.
</summarium>
    <notae>The original French edition was published around 1903. Hector France (1837-1908) was a controversial French author known for his anti-clerical and libertine works. This novel is explicitly anti-clerical in nature and would definitely NOT be considered appropriate for children or receive a nihil obstat or imprimatur from Catholic authorities, despite dealing with Catholic clergy as subject matter. The work was translated into English by Alfred Allinson, who translated many of France's works.

    <summarium>This is a critical biography of George Crabbe (1754-1832), the English poet known for his realistic depictions of rural life and social issues in works like &quot;The Village&quot; and &quot;The Borough.&quot; Written by Alfred Ainger as part of the influential &quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series, this book examines Crabbe's life and literary achievements. The work draws heavily on the memoir written by Crabbe's son in 1834, as well as manuscript materials including sermons, letters, and commonplace books. Ainger also benefited from annotations by Edward FitzGerald, who had personal connections to Crabbe's descendants.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1903 is clearly stated in the title page as 'NINETEEN HUNDRED AND THREE'. This is a work of literary biography and criticism rather than Crabbe's original poetry, so the date reflects when this scholarly assessment was published rather than when Crabbe's own works appeared (which were primarily early 19th century).

    <summarium>This is an audio recording of remarks from Addie Worth Bagley Daniels describing her visit to Thomas Edison's laboratory. The recording is part of the Edison National Historic Site collection and provides a first-hand account of observations at one of America's most important centers of invention during the early 20th century. Edison's laboratory was the birthplace of numerous groundbreaking inventions including the phonograph, motion pictures, and improvements to electric lighting. This primary source document offers historical insight into Edison's work environment and operations.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact year is difficult to determine from the Gutenberg text alone, as it doesn't specify when the visit or recording took place. Edison's main laboratory period was from the 1870s through early 1900s, with his West Orange laboratory (which became the Edison National Historic Site) operating from 1887-1931. Given that this appears to be an audio recording (available as MP3 files) and edited by Edison himself, I've estimated circa 1903 as a reasonable midpoint of Edison's most productive laboratory years and when audio recording technology would have been available. The actual recording could be anywhere from roughly 1890-1920s. The Gutenberg release date (2003) is clearly just the digitization date, not the original work date.

    <summarium>'The Mettle of the Pasture' is a novel by American author James Lane Allen, published in 1903. Allen was known for his romantic regionalist fiction set in Kentucky, including works like 'The Choir Invisible' and 'A Kentucky Cardinal.' This novel continues his exploration of Southern pastoral themes and human character. The opening scene depicts a woman in contemplation in an elegant Kentucky home, setting a romantic and atmospheric tone characteristic of Allen's style. The novel explores themes of love, morality, and social conventions in turn-of-the-century Kentucky society.

    <notae>The year 1903 is clearly stated on the title page. This is the original publication year as indicated in the Project Gutenberg text. James Lane Allen (1849-1925) was a prominent American novelist during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and this was one of his major works from his mature period.

    <summarium>'People of the Whirlpool' is a novel by Mabel Osgood Wright, presented as the experience book of a commuter's wife. Wright was an American author and naturalist known for her nature writing and novels about American life in the early 20th century. This work is told through an epistolary format (indicated by chapters titled 'Miss Lavinia's Letters to Barbara' and 'Martin Cortright's Letters') and explores domestic and social life in the era of early American suburbanization, when commuting from countryside to city was becoming common. The 'whirlpool' likely refers to the social whirl and complexities of navigating between rural and urban worlds during this transitional period in American society.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1903 is stated directly on the title page of the Project Gutenberg edition. Mabel Osgood Wright (1859-1934) was a pioneering American author, ornithologist, and conservationist. While not specifically a Catholic author, her works were generally wholesome and appropriate for family reading, reflecting Progressive Era values.

    <summarium>'No Hero' is a novel by E. W. Hornung, best known as the creator of the gentleman thief Raffles. Published in 1903, this work represents Hornung's other literary output beyond his famous Raffles stories. Hornung was a popular English author of the late Victorian and Edwardian era, known for his crime fiction and adventure stories. While 'No Hero' is less well-known than his Raffles series, it demonstrates his skill in crafting suspenseful narratives with moral complexity. The chapter titles suggest a story involving conflict, pursuit, and dramatic tension, typical of Hornung's narrative style.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1903 is clearly stated in the Project Gutenberg text and represents the original publication date. E. W. Hornung (Ernest William Hornung, 1866-1921) was Arthur Conan Doyle's brother-in-law and achieved fame primarily through his Raffles series, though he wrote numerous other novels and stories during his career.

    <summarium>&quot;The Third String&quot; is one of the short stories from W.W. Jacobs' collection &quot;Odd Craft,&quot; published in 1903. Jacobs was a popular English humorist and author known for his maritime tales and stories of dockside life. This particular story features one of his recurring characters, a night-watchman who serves as narrator, philosophizing about love and its complications in his distinctive working-class voice. Jacobs is perhaps best known for his supernatural story &quot;The Monkey's Paw,&quot; but the majority of his work consisted of humorous tales like this one, featuring colorful characters and witty observations about everyday life in late Victorian and Edwardian England.

The stories are gentle comedies suitable for general audiences, featuring working-class characters like sailors, night-watchmen, and dock workers.

    <summarium>&quot;Odd Craft&quot; is a collection of humorous short stories by W.W. Jacobs, one of the most popular English humorists of the early 20th century. The collection features Jacobs' characteristic tales of maritime life, often told through the voice of a night-watchman narrator who recounts the adventures and misadventures of sailors and dockworkers. The stories are known for their wit, clever dialogue, and gentle satire of working-class English life. Characters like Ginger Dick, Peter Russet, and Sam Small recur throughout Jacobs' work.

Jacobs was an English author best known for his supernatural story 'The Monkey's Paw' but was primarily a writer of comedic tales featuring working-class and rural English characters. The collection includes various stories of romantic comedy and gentle humor, including 'Blundell's Improvement,' which opens with a scene of two suitors competing for the attention of Venia Turnbull while her father desperately tries to take his Sunday afternoon nap. Jacobs' work was enormously popular in the Edwardian era for its wit, character-driven humor, and clean, accessible style.

    <summarium>&quot;The Faith of Men&quot; is a collection of short stories by Jack London set primarily in the Yukon and Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush era. The collection features London's characteristic tales of survival, human nature under extreme conditions, and the moral complexities of men living on the frontier. These stories explore themes of loyalty, betrayal, courage, and the &quot;faith&quot; that men place in each other when civilization's constraints are stripped away. London drew heavily on his own experiences in the Klondike during 1897-1898 for these tales, which showcase his naturalistic writing style and his fascination with the harsh realities of life in the frozen North.
</summarium>
    <notae>&quot;The Faith of Men&quot; was originally published in 1904 as a short story collection. While the Project Gutenberg text indicates it was prepared from a 1919 William Heinemann edition (a reprint), the work itself was first published in 1904. This represents London's early period as a writer, following his initial success with &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; (1903) and preceding &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; (1904). The 1904 date is the most historically accurate for educational timeline purposes as it marks when these stories first appeared as a collected work.

    <summarium>This is a biography of the Victorian poet Robert Browning written by Edward Dowden, Professor of English Literature at the University of Dublin. The work is part of &quot;The Temple Biographies&quot; series edited by Dugald Macfadyen. Dowden focuses on what he calls &quot;a biography of the mind&quot; (borrowing Gladstone's phrase), examining Browning's intellectual and spiritual development through his poetry rather than simply recounting external events. The biography associates Browning's poems with their dates and origins to illuminate his inward development. Browning (1812-1889) was one of the most important Victorian poets, known for his dramatic monologues and philosophical optimism. This biography appeared in 1904, fifteen years after Browning's death, during a period of growing scholarly interest in his work.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year of 1904 is clearly stated on the title page. This is a critical biography written after Browning's death in 1889, part of the scholarly apparatus that established Browning as a major Victorian literary figure. The work emphasizes Browning's role as an &quot;authoritative interpreter of the spiritual factors in human life&quot; and his &quot;tonic optimism,&quot; reflecting the Edwardian era's view of Victorian poetry.

    <summarium>&quot;The Persecution of Bob Pretty&quot; is a humorous short story by W. W. Jacobs, part of his collection &quot;Odd Craft&quot; published in 1904. The story is told by an elderly narrator who recounts the exploits of Bob Pretty, a notorious poacher and clever schemer in a rural English village. Jacobs was known for his comic tales of English country life and seafaring adventures, with a gift for dialect and character. His stories often featured working-class characters engaged in petty schemes and comedic misunderstandings. This particular tale is characteristic of his gentle, humorous style that made him one of the most popular English short story writers of the early 20th century.

    <notae>I chose 1904 as the year because this is when &quot;Odd Craft&quot; was originally published. W. W. Jacobs (William Wymark Jacobs, 1863-1943) was a prolific English author best known for &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; (1902) but who wrote many lighthearted stories about rural and maritime England.

    <summarium>'The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science' is a foundational text in the New Thought movement, originally delivered as lectures in Edinburgh's Queen Street Hall in 1904. Thomas Troward, a retired divisional judge from Punjab, India, presents a systematic exploration of the relationship between mental action and material conditions. The work examines concepts such as spirit and matter, subjective and objective mind, intuition, healing, and the will. Troward's lectures were influential in the development of New Thought philosophy and later influenced various self-help and metaphysical movements. The book attempts to establish natural principles governing how thought influences reality, blending elements of philosophy, psychology, and metaphysics.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1904 is clearly indicated in the foreword dated March 1904. While Thomas Troward was nominally Christian, this is decidedly not a Catholic work - it belongs to the New Thought movement which has different theological foundations. Therefore, it does not receive the 'catholic' tag. The work is philosophical/metaphysical in nature and while not inappropriate for older children, its abstract content is more suited to adult readers, so it does not receive the 'appropriate-for-children' tag.

    <summarium>&quot;Dialstone Lane, Part 5&quot; is a portion of the novel &quot;Dialstone Lane&quot; by W.W.

The novel follows the adventures of several characters aboard the ship &quot;Fair Emily&quot; as they journey southward, ostensibly on a pleasure cruise. The narrative hints at hidden motives and treasure-seeking beneath the surface of their stated purpose of studying island formations. Jacobs was celebrated for his light, comedic touch and his ability to capture the dialects and mannerisms of sailors and working-class characters. This work exemplifies his characteristic blend of gentle humor, maritime adventure, and character-driven comedy.

Troward's systematic approach to metaphysical principles influenced later spiritual and self-help movements, bridging Western philosophy with practical mental science. His work emphasizes the creative power of thought and the unity of universal and individual consciousness.

    <notae>Year is based on the foreword date of March 1904, when the lectures were compiled into book form shortly after being delivered. This is the original publication date of the work. While Troward was a British colonial judge, his work is philosophical/metaphysical rather than Catholic in nature - it belongs to the New Thought movement which drew from various spiritual traditions but was not specifically Catholic. The work had significant influence on later self-help and positive thinking literature.

    <summarium>A posthumous collection of works by Eugene Field (1850-1895), one of America's most beloved poets and humorists. Field was renowned for his children's poetry and his newspaper humor column &quot;Sharps and Flats.&quot; This collection appears to showcase both his whimsical, child-oriented verse and his humorous prose for adult audiences. The introduction compares his delicate and fanciful humor to contemporaries like Mark Twain, Artemus Ward, and James Whitcomb Riley, highlighting Field's rare genius and childlike simplicity in his approach to both poetry and prose.
</summarium>
    <notae>Publication year is 1905, though Eugene Field died in 1895, making this a posthumous collection. The year 1905 is appropriate as it represents when this particular compilation was published and made available to readers.

    <summarium>This is a volume in the 'Religions Ancient and Modern' series published by Archibald Constable &amp; Co. The work by J. Allanson Picton (M.A., author of 'The Religion of the Universe') examines pantheism as a philosophical and religious concept, tracing its historical development and exploring its significance across different cultures and time periods. Pantheism is the belief that God and the universe are identical, or that all reality is divine. The series was designed to present salient features of great religions, philosophies, and cultural achievements to a broad public audience. Other volumes in the series covered Greek religion, animism, Chinese religions, Islam, Buddhism, and other topics.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1905 is based on the publication date of this series and this particular volume. The 'Religions Ancient and Modern' series was published in the early 1900s by Archibald Constable &amp; Co. in foolscap 8vo format at 1 shilling net per volume. While I cannot see a specific copyright date in the excerpt provided, bibliographic records indicate this work was published around 1905. This is not a Catholic work - Picton was writing from a philosophical/comparative religion perspective examining pantheism across traditions.

    <summarium>'Our Little Korean Cousin' is part of the popular 'Little Cousin' series published in the early 1900s, designed to introduce American children to the lives, customs, and cultures of children in other countries. This volume focuses on Korea through the story of a young Korean boy named Yung Pak. The book provides insights into Korean life, traditions, superstitions, and customs during a period of significant historical change for Korea, when Western influences were beginning to penetrate the previously isolated nation. The author references the work of American and British figures like Rodgers, Blake, and Kimberly who played roles in opening Korea to Western influence and education.
</summarium>
    <notae>The 'Little Cousin' series was published primarily between 1901-1910. Based on the references to 'recent events' that introduced Korea to the world and the mention of it being a time of change (likely referring to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 and increasing foreign influence in Korea), this book was most likely published around 1905. The Project Gutenberg ID 12048 also suggests an early 20th century publication date.

    <summarium>The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is one of Beatrix Potter's beloved children's stories featuring anthropomorphic animals. The story follows a little girl named Lucie who loses her pocket-handkerchiefs and goes searching for them, eventually discovering Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, a hedgehog washerwoman who does laundry for all the animals. Like Potter's other works, it combines charming illustrations with gentle storytelling aimed at young children. The character of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was inspired by Potter's own pet hedgehog and by Kitty MacDonald, a Scottish washerwoman. This is one of the classic &quot;little books&quot; in Potter's Peter Rabbit series that has remained continuously in print and beloved by generations of children.

    <summarium>The Return of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of 13 short stories featuring Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective. Published after Doyle had attempted to kill off Holmes at the Reichenbach Falls in &quot;The Final Problem&quot; (1893), this collection marks the detective's dramatic return to literature. The stories were originally published in The Strand Magazine between 1903-1904 before being collected in book form. The opening story, &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House,&quot; explains Holmes's survival and three-year absence. These tales represent some of the most beloved Holmes mysteries, including &quot;The Adventure of the Dancing Men&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons.&quot;
</summarium>
    <notae>The stories were serialized 1903-1904, with the book collection published in 1905. I chose 1905 as it represents the complete work as a unified collection. Doyle was raised Catholic but left the faith as an adult, becoming interested in spiritualism, so this work does not receive a 'catholic' tag despite his background.

    <summarium>A posthumous collection of short stories by Victorian novelist George Gissing, published three years after his death. Gissing was known for his realistic portrayals of late Victorian English life, particularly focusing on the struggles of the lower-middle class and the educated poor. This collection includes nine short stories with an introductory survey by Thomas Seccombe.

    <summarium>'The Second Generation' is a novel by David Graham Phillips, an American \
journalist and novelist who was part of the muckraking movement. Phillips was \
known for his social realist fiction that criticized American society, \
particularly the wealthy class and political corruption. This novel explores \
themes common to Phillips' work: the inheritance of wealth, the moral decay of \
the upper classes, and the challenges faced by those who inherit rather than \
earn their fortunes. The chapter titles suggest a narrative about family \
legacy, wills, legal matters, and romantic entanglements within the context of \
generational wealth transfer. Phillips' work often examined how second-generation \
wealth affected character and society.\
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1906 is clearly indicated on the title page. This was during Phillips' \
most productive period as a novelist. He was not a Catholic author - he was a \
secular progressive reformer and muckraker who was critical of many American \
institutions. The work would not be considered suitable for an imprimatur. \
Phillips was assassinated in 1911 by a man who believed one of his novels \
defamed his family.\

    <summarium>This is a curated collection of Robert Louis Stevenson's personal essays, edited by William Lyon Phelps and published in 1906, two years after Stevenson's death in 1894. The collection focuses on essays that reveal Stevenson's personality, character, and philosophy rather than his formal literary criticism. Notable essays include 'An Apology for Idlers,' 'Aes Triplex' (a meditation on mortality and courage), 'On the Enjoyment of Unpleasant Places,' and 'Talk and Talkers.' Stevenson (1850-1894) was a Scottish novelist and essayist best known for 'Treasure Island' and 'Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.' His essays are celebrated for their elegant prose style, optimistic philosophy despite his chronic illness, and insights into the art of living well. This particular edition was designed for educational use in schools and colleges.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1906 as the year because this is a posthumous editorial collection published specifically in this form. While the individual essays were written earlier (during Stevenson's lifetime, primarily in the 1870s-1880s), this particular work as a unified, edited volume with Phelps's introduction and notes is a 1906 publication. For a historical timeline, this represents when this influential educational edition entered circulation and helped establish Stevenson's essays as part of the English literary canon in American academia. If you prefer the dates when the individual essays were originally published, those would range from approximately 1876-1887, but that seems less appropriate for this specific editorial collection.

    <summarium>'Friday, the Thirteenth' is a novel by Thomas W. Lawson, an American stock promoter and author, that explores Wall Street manipulation and stock market schemes. Published in 1907 during the era of financial excess and market manipulation, the book is a semi-autobiographical financial thriller that exposed the practices of stock market operators and corporate raiders. Lawson himself was involved in various financial schemes and stock promotions, lending authenticity to his fictional portrayal of market manipulation. The novel was quite popular in its time and contributed to public discourse about financial reform and market regulation during the Progressive Era.
</summarium>
    <notae>The copyright page shows both 1906 and 1907 dates, with publication listed as February 1907. I chose 1907 as the primary year since that's when it was formally published. The book was written during a period of significant financial turmoil leading up to the Panic of 1907, and Lawson's insider perspective on market manipulation made this work particularly relevant to contemporary readers concerned about financial corruption.

    <summarium>Part of the popular 'Little Cousin Series' published in the early 20th century, this book was designed to introduce American children to the lives, customs, and cultures of people in Alaska. The series as a whole aimed to foster understanding and appreciation of different peoples and places around the world through engaging stories about children from various regions. This particular volume would have provided young readers with insights into Alaskan life, indigenous peoples, and the unique environment of America's northern territory during a period of growing American interest in the region following the Gold Rush and prior to statehood.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year is not visible in the provided excerpt, but the Little Cousin Series was most actively published between 1901-1910. The year 1907 is an educated estimate based on the series' publication pattern and Alaska's historical context during this period. Alaska wouldn't become a state until 1959, so this book represents an early 20th century American perspective on the territory.

    <summarium>&quot;The Way of Peace&quot; is a spiritual and philosophical work by James Allen, the British author best known for &quot;As a Man Thinketh.&quot; This book explores themes of meditation, spiritual development, selflessness, and inner peace. Allen presents a practical philosophy for achieving spiritual growth through meditation and self-mastery, discussing topics such as the power of meditation, the realization of selfless love, and the attainment of perfect peace. The work reflects Allen's New Thought philosophy, emphasizing the power of thought and meditation to transform one's life and achieve spiritual enlightenment. Written in an accessible, devotional style, it offers guidance for those seeking inner peace and spiritual development through contemplation and ethical living.
</summarium>
    <notae>James Allen published &quot;The Way of Peace&quot; in 1907, shortly after his most famous work &quot;As a Man Thinketh&quot; (1903). While Allen was influenced by Christian mysticism and uses Christian terminology, his work represents the New Thought movement rather than orthodox Christian theology. The book has a universalist spiritual orientation rather than being specifically Catholic or aligned with Catholic teaching, so it would not receive a nihil obstat or imprimatur. The publication year of 1907 represents when Allen wrote and published this specific work.

    <summarium>This is a scientific critique by Alfred Russel Wallace (co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection alongside Darwin) examining Percival Lowell's theories about the habitability of Mars. Wallace wrote this in response to Lowell's book 'Mars and Its Canals,' which proposed that Mars had artificial canals built by intelligent beings and a climate suitable for life. Wallace systematically refutes Lowell's claims using mathematical and physical arguments about Mars's atmosphere, temperature, and climate. He argues that Mars's thin atmosphere and distance from the sun make it uninhabitable, contrary to Lowell's optimistic assessments. The work represents an important historical debate in planetary science before modern space exploration definitively resolved these questions.
</summarium>
    <notae>Published in 1907. This was one of Wallace's later scientific works (he lived 1823-1913). The debate between Wallace and Lowell about Martian canals and habitability was a major scientific controversy of the early 20th century. Lowell's theories about artificial canals on Mars were eventually disproven by spacecraft observations, vindicating Wallace's skepticism.

    <summarium>'The Long Shadow' is a Western novel by B.M. Bower (pen name of Bertha Muzzy Sinclair), one of the first successful female authors of Western fiction. The novel is set in the American West during the early 20th century and follows the story of 'Charming Billy' and other cowboys as they navigate the changing landscape of the range. The book explores themes of frontier life, romance, and the transformation of the Old West as modernization encroaches. Bower was known for her realistic portrayal of cowboy life and her ability to capture the spirit of the Western range, drawing on her own experiences living in Montana.
</summarium>
    <notae>Copyright date of 1908 matches the original publication year. B.M. Bower (Bertha Muzzy Sinclair) was a pioneering female Western writer who wrote over 60 novels. The dedication suggests the novel deals with the end of the open range era and the changes facing Western ranchers and cowboys in the early 1900s.

The work focuses particularly on the evolution of Great Britain's recognition of the conflict's belligerent status and examines the divergence between English practice and Continental/American interpretations of international law regarding neutral commerce. It draws heavily on British Blue Books, U.S. Foreign Relations documents, and Congressional records.

    <summarium>'Buried Alive: A Tale of These Days' is a comedic novel by English author Arnold Bennett, first published in 1908. The story follows Priam Farll, a famous but reclusive painter who is terrified of public attention. When his valet dies suddenly, Farll sees an opportunity to escape his fame by switching identities with the deceased servant. The novel satirizes English society, fame, and the art world of the Edwardian era.

    <notae>1908 is the original publication year. Arnold Bennett was not a Catholic author - he came from a Methodist background and later became more secular/agnostic in his views. The novel is lighthearted comedy/satire rather than having religious themes, so it does not qualify for the 'catholic' tag. The dedication to John Frederick Farrar (identified as M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. - medical qualifications) suggests a personal friendship, and Bennett humorously calls him a 'collaborator' though this appears to be affectionate jest rather than literal co-authorship.</notae>

    <summarium>The Primadonna is a novel by F.

The story explores themes of love, ambition, and the theatrical world, set against the backdrop of European high society and the opera stage. Crawford was known for his detailed portrayals of Italian life and society, and this work continues that tradition while focusing on the dramatic world of opera performance.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1908 is clearly indicated in the book's front matter. This is the original publication date of the novel. F. Marion Crawford (1854-1909) was a prolific American author who spent most of his adult life in Italy. While he had Catholic connections (his uncle was sculptor Thomas Crawford, and he converted to Catholicism), his fiction was primarily romantic and adventure-oriented rather than explicitly Catholic in nature, so I have not included the 'catholic' tag.

    <summarium>This is the second volume of a ten-volume anthology of historically significant Christian sermons, compiled by Grenville Kleiser with assistance from contemporary theologians and an introduction by Lewis O. Brastow of Yale. This volume covers the period from Thomas Hooker (1586-1647) through Robert South, spanning roughly the 17th century. It includes sermons from prominent English-speaking Protestant divines of the Reformation and post-Reformation period. Thomas Hooker, the first preacher featured, was a Cambridge-educated Puritan who fled England under Archbishop Laud's persecution and became a founder of Connecticut. The anthology serves as both a theological resource and a historical document of Christian preaching during a pivotal period in English and American religious history.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1908 is estimated based on Grenville Kleiser's active publishing period and typical publication dates for such anthologies. This is a Protestant anthology focusing on Reformed and Anglican preachers, not a Catholic work. While it contains valuable historical religious material, it would not carry a nihil obstat or imprimatur. The 'appropriate-for-children' tag is omitted as this is scholarly theological material intended for mature readers and seminary students.

    <summarium>'The House on the Borderland' is a supernatural horror novel by William Hope Hodgson, considered one of the pioneering works of cosmic horror and weird fiction. The story is presented as a manuscript discovered in the ruins of a house in rural Ireland, detailing the bizarre and terrifying experiences of an unnamed recluse who lives in an isolated house with his sister and dog. The narrative combines psychological horror with cosmic visions, including interdimensional travel, encounters with swine-like creatures, and apocalyptic visions of the end of time. The novel influenced later writers like H.P. Lovecraft and is noted for its innovative blending of horror genres and its ambitious scope spanning both intimate personal terror and vast cosmic dread.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was first published in 1908. This is one of Hodgson's most famous works and represents an important early contribution to the cosmic horror genre. The framing device of the manuscript being discovered by Tonnison and Berreggnog adds to the verisimilitude of the tale. While Hodgson wrote other notable works including maritime horror stories, this novel stands as his most ambitious and influential work. Not appropriate for children due to horror content and disturbing imagery.

    <summarium>'The Servant in the House' is a Christian allegorical drama by Charles Rann Kennedy, first produced in 1908. The play centers on Manson, a mysterious servant who arrives at an English vicarage and reveals himself to be more than he appears. Through his presence, the play explores themes of brotherhood, hypocrisy, and true Christian service. The servant character serves as a Christ-like figure who exposes the moral failings and pretensions of the vicar and his household while advocating for genuine love and service to others. The play was quite popular in its time and became one of Kennedy's most well-known works, praised for its spiritual depth and social commentary on religious hypocrisy.</summarium>
    <notae>The copyright page clearly indicates 1908 as the publication year. The play is explicitly Christian in its themes and messaging (as evidenced by the biblical epigraph from 1 John about loving one's brother), though Charles Rann Kennedy was not Catholic but rather wrote from a broader Christian/spiritual perspective. The work has strong moral and religious themes but is not specifically Catholic in orientation, so I have not included the 'catholic' tag. The drama deals with mature themes of hypocrisy and moral failing, so I have not included 'appropriate-for-children' tag.</notae>

    <summarium>&quot;Elusive Isabel&quot; is a spy thriller novel by Jacques Futrelle, best known for creating &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; detective stories. This novel follows the mysterious Isabel Thorne, a beautiful and enigmatic woman involved in international intrigue in Washington D.C. The story involves espionage, secret agents, romance, and diplomatic machinations as various parties attempt to uncover Isabel's true identity and mission. It combines elements of mystery, adventure, and early spy fiction, characteristic of the pre-WWI era when concerns about foreign agents and diplomatic secrets were beginning to capture popular imagination.

Jacques Futrelle (1875-1912) was an American journalist and mystery writer who tragically died in the sinking of the Titanic. This work represents the early development of the spy thriller genre in American literature, predating the more famous spy novels that would emerge during and after World War I.

    <summarium>The House on the Borderland is a supernatural horror novel by William Hope Hodgson, first published in 1908. The story is framed as a manuscript discovered in the ruins of a house in rural Ireland. It tells of a recluse who lives in an isolated house and experiences terrifying visions of cosmic horror, including encounters with pig-like creatures and journeys through time and space. The novel is considered a pioneering work of cosmic horror and weird fiction, predating and influencing H.P. Lovecraft's work. It combines elements of the haunted house story with metaphysical speculation about the nature of reality, time, and the universe's end. The work is notable for its ambitious scope, moving from intimate personal horror to vast cosmic vistas.
</summarium>
    <notae>1908 is the year of first publication by Chapman &amp; Hall in London. This is Hodgson's most celebrated work and a landmark in the development of weird fiction and cosmic horror. The novel was influential on later writers in the genre, particularly H.P. Lovecraft, who praised it. Not appropriate for children due to horror content. Not a Catholic work - Hodgson was not a Catholic author and the work deals with cosmic horror themes rather than Christian theology.

    <summarium>'Sailors' Knots' is a collection of humorous short stories by W.W. Jacobs, an English author known for his tales of dockside life and supernatural fiction. While Jacobs is perhaps best remembered for 'The Monkey's Paw,' he wrote numerous collections of comic stories about sailors, longshoremen, and working-class characters in early 20th century England. This collection includes 'The Toll-House,' a ghost story that begins with a group of friends at the Three Feathers Inn debating the existence of the supernatural. Jacobs was a master of both comedy and the macabre, often blending wit with elements of mystery and the uncanny.
</summarium>
    <notae>The text clearly shows 1909 as the publication year. W.W. Jacobs (William Wymark Jacobs, 1863-1943) was a prolific English short story writer. His works are generally appropriate for older children and adults, featuring gentle humor and occasional supernatural elements without graphic content.

    <summarium>A Pluralistic Universe is a collection of William James's Hibbert Lectures delivered at Manchester College in 1909. In this work, James develops his philosophy of radical empiricism and argues for a pluralistic metaphysics against the monistic idealism that was dominant in his time (particularly absolute idealism as represented by thinkers like Bradley and Royce). James contrasts rationalism with empiricism, theism with pantheism, and most importantly, argues for pluralism over monism - the view that reality consists of many independent things rather than a single unified Absolute. The work is a major contribution to American pragmatist philosophy and represents James's mature philosophical position. He argues that the 'each-form' of representing the world is more adequate than the 'all-form', and that finite consciousness has features that cannot be reconciled with absolute idealism.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1909 is straightforward as this is when the lectures were delivered and the book was published. William James was not Catholic - he was raised in a broadly Protestant environment and his philosophy, while sympathetic to religious experience, represents a pragmatist and empiricist tradition quite distinct from Catholic scholasticism. The work is highly technical philosophy and not appropriate for children.

    <summarium>This is an early audio recording from the Edison era, part of the Edison National Historic Site collection. George P. Watson performed this piece, which was edited by Thomas A. Edison. The title &quot;Does Your Mother Know You're Out?&quot; suggests it's likely a comedic or vaudeville-style performance piece typical of the early recording industry. This represents an important piece of audio history from the pioneering days of sound recording technology.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact year is difficult to determine from the Gutenberg metadata alone. Edison's peak recording years were roughly 1890s-1920s. Given Watson's involvement and Edison's editorial role, this likely dates to the 1900s-1910s era of cylinder or early disc recordings. I've estimated ~1909 as a reasonable midpoint of Edison's active recording period, but the actual recording date could range from approximately 1895-1920. The Project Gutenberg release date (2003) is clearly just the digitization date, not the original recording date.

    <summarium>'Chivalry' is a collection of romantic historical tales by James Branch Cabell, one of America's most distinctive early 20th-century writers. The work consists of interconnected stories set in medieval times, exploring themes of romance, honor, and idealized love through various historical and legendary figures. Cabell was known for his elaborate prose style, ironic wit, and creation of an intricate fictional genealogy connecting his various works. This book fits into his larger 'Biography of the Life of Manuel' series, which traces an imaginary lineage through romantic and chivalric tales. The work reflects Cabell's fascination with medieval romance traditions and his characteristic blend of romanticism and skepticism.
</summarium>
    <notae>While this Project Gutenberg edition is dated 1921, 'Chivalry' was originally published in 1909 by Harper &amp; Brothers. The 1921 date likely refers to a revised or reissued edition. I've chosen 1909 as the historically accurate publication year for the original work. Cabell revised and republished several of his works throughout his career, particularly after the controversy surrounding 'Jurgen' (1919) brought him wider attention. The dedication to 'Anne Branch Cabell' and the introduction discussing Cabell's cohesive body of work suggest this may be from a later collected edition, but the work itself originates from 1909.

    <summarium>This is an early audio recording from the Edison cylinder era, featuring Ada Jones performing a comedic dialogue between two Irish-American women gossiping over the backyard fence. Ada Jones (1873-1922) was one of the most prolific and popular recording artists of the early phonograph era, known especially for her ethnic comedy routines and character voices. This type of 'backyard conversation' sketch was a popular vaudeville and phonograph format in the early 1900s, representing everyday immigrant life with humor and dialect. The recording comes from the Edison National Historic Site collection.</summarium>
    <notae>The exact recording date is difficult to pinpoint from this metadata alone. Ada Jones was most active recording for Edison between roughly 1905-1920. Given the title format and the Edison cylinder context, I'm estimating circa 1910 as a reasonable middle point of her peak recording period, though it could range anywhere from 1905-1915. This represents the approximate era when such recordings were made rather than a definitively known publication year.</notae>

This first volume covers his childhood, youth, apprenticeship years as a craftsman, his entry into the workers' movement and public life, his encounters with Ferdinand Lassalle and Wilhelm Liebknecht, and the development of the German labor movement through the turbulent period of German unification in the 1860s.

    <summarium>Carnacki, The Ghost Finder is a collection of supernatural detective stories by William Hope Hodgson featuring Thomas Carnacki, an Edwardian occult detective who investigates hauntings and supernatural phenomena. The stories follow a consistent structure where Carnacki invites a small group of friends to dinner and then recounts his latest investigation. Hodgson blends supernatural horror with pseudo-scientific explanations, as Carnacki uses both occult knowledge and invented devices like the 'Electric Pentacle' to combat paranormal threats. The collection includes some of Hodgson's most famous stories, including 'The Gateway of the Monster,' 'The House Among the Laurels,' and 'The Whistling Room.' Hodgson was an innovative early 20th-century writer who significantly influenced the development of both supernatural horror and weird fiction.

I've chosen 1910 as it represents when the first Carnacki stories appeared in print and when the character was introduced to the reading public. A posthumous expanded edition was published in 1947 with additional stories.

    <summarium>&quot;The Money Moon&quot; is a romantic novel by British author Jeffery Farnol, published in 1911. Farnol was known for his romantic historical and adventure novels written in a distinctive style that often featured pastoral English settings. This work is a lighter romance compared to his more famous novel &quot;The Broad Highway&quot; (1910). The story involves George Bellew and a character called &quot;Small Porges&quot; in what appears to be a pastoral English setting.

This was published shortly after his successful debut novel &quot;The Broad Highway&quot; (1910), which established his reputation as a romance writer.

    <summarium>This is part of H. Irving Hancock's West Point series following the adventures of Dick Prescott during his fourth and final year at the United States Military Academy. The book chronicles his experiences as a senior cadet preparing to graduate and receive his commission as a military officer. The series was popular early 20th century juvenile fiction that romanticized military academy life and featured themes of honor, duty, and friendship among cadets. The plot includes typical elements of the series such as intrigue among cadets, athletic competitions (including the Army-Navy baseball game), and challenges to the protagonist's character and standing.
</summarium>
    <notae>The Dick Prescott at West Point series was published between 1910-1911. This being the &quot;Fourth Year&quot; volume would place it at approximately 1911. H. Irving Hancock was a prolific author of juvenile series fiction in the early 1900s, writing multiple series about military schools, the Navy, and adventure stories aimed at young male readers. While popular in their time, these works represent a particular era of American literature focused on traditional military values and coming-of-age stories within institutional settings.

    <summarium>&quot;Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers&quot; is part of the Tom Swift series of juvenile adventure novels published by the Stratemeyer Syndicate under the house pseudonym Victor Appleton. The series follows the adventures of Tom Swift, a young inventor and entrepreneur. In this particular installment, Tom investigates mysterious diamond makers and travels to Phantom Mountain, encountering various adventures involving secret caves and the artificial creation of diamonds. The Tom Swift series was enormously popular in the early 20th century and helped establish many tropes of young adult adventure and science fiction literature.

    <notae>The Tom Swift series began in 1910 with &quot;Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle.&quot; &quot;Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers&quot; was the seventh book in the original series, published in 1911. Victor Appleton was not a real person but a pseudonym used by the Stratemeyer Syndicate, with various ghostwriters producing the books. The series was aimed at young boys and emphasized themes of invention, adventure, and American ingenuity during the Progressive Era.

    <summarium>This is Eugene Mason's 1911 English translation of the Lays of Marie de France, supplemented with additional medieval romance stories. Marie de France was a 12th-century poet (likely writing c. 1160-1178) who composed narrative poems in Anglo-Norman French. She is one of the earliest known female authors in European vernacular literature. Her lays are short narrative poems that typically deal with courtly love, chivalry, and Celtic folklore themes. The collection focuses primarily on romantic love and represents an important window into medieval literary culture and the rare voice of a medieval woman artist. The translator notes this may be the fullest English version of Marie's lays available at that time.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1911 represents the publication year of this specific translation by Eugene Mason. The original lays by Marie de France date from approximately 1160-1178 in the 12th century. Since this is a translation collection rather than the original medieval texts, and the use case is a historical timeline where the translation itself has scholarly and historical value, 1911 is the most appropriate date. If you wanted to represent Marie de France's original composition period instead, approximately 1170 would be more accurate.

    <summarium>&quot;The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol&quot; is an early 20th century juvenile adventure novel featuring the Boy Scouts of America movement. Written by Lieut. Howard Payson, it follows a group of boy scouts called the Eagle Patrol through various outdoor adventures, mysteries, and challenges. The story includes typical elements of early Boy Scout fiction: camping, tracking, rescues, competitions, and character-building scenarios. The book was part of the explosion of Boy Scout literature that followed the founding of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910, designed to promote the values and activities of the scouting movement to young readers.
</summarium>
    <notae>The Boy Scouts of America was founded in 1910, and this appears to be one of the early Boy Scout series books published shortly thereafter, likely around 1911-1913. I've chosen 1911 as a reasonable estimate for when this type of early BSA fiction would have been published, during the initial wave of Boy Scout enthusiasm. The &quot;Lieut. Howard Payson&quot; byline was likely a pseudonym used by the Stratemeyer Syndicate or similar publisher of juvenile series books, as was common practice for this type of literature. Without access to the copyright page, 1911 represents the most historically appropriate year for this early Boy Scout adventure series.

    <summarium>'The Dawn of All' is a Catholic utopian novel by Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson, written as a counterpoint to his earlier dystopian work 'Lord of the World' (1907). While 'Lord of the World' depicted a future where secularism and modernism had triumphed, 'The Dawn of All' presents an alternate future (set approximately sixty years hence from its publication) where Catholic and traditional Christian thought has instead become dominant in society. The novel explores the social, political, and spiritual developments that might occur if ancient Catholic wisdom were to be embraced rather than rejected by modern civilization. The preface also includes Benson's defense of the historical Church's involvement in religious persecution, arguing that such policies were driven by the State rather than the Church and were responses to perceived threats to civil stability rather than mere theological disagreement.
</summarium>
    <notae>Published in 1911, this was one of Benson's later works before his early death in 1914 at age 43. Robert Hugh Benson was a convert to Catholicism (1903) and son of Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1904 and became a Monsignor in 1911. Both 'Lord of the World' and 'The Dawn of All' are considered pioneering works of Catholic speculative fiction, exploring opposing trajectories for Western civilization.

    <summarium>The Vanishing Man (also published as &quot;The Eye of Osiris&quot;) is a detective novel by R. Austin Freeman featuring his famous forensic detective Dr. John Thorndyke. The story involves the mysterious disappearance of John Bellingham and the subsequent investigation using scientific detection methods. Freeman is considered one of the pioneers of the &quot;inverted detective story&quot; and was known for his meticulous attention to forensic science and medical jurisprudence. This novel showcases Thorndyke's methodical approach to solving crimes through careful observation and scientific analysis, including the examination of physical evidence and expert testimony in court proceedings.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1911 is clearly stated on the title page of the Gutenberg text. R. Austin Freeman (1862-1943) was a British writer of detective stories, primarily featuring Dr. Thorndyke. This work was originally published as &quot;The Eye of Osiris&quot; in the UK and as &quot;The Vanishing Man&quot; in the US, both in 1911. Freeman was himself a qualified physician and used his medical knowledge extensively in his detective fiction, essentially creating the medical-legal detective genre.

    <summarium>'Ship's Company' is a collection of humorous short stories by W.W. Jacobs featuring recurring characters Sam Small, Ginger Dick, and Peter Russet - three sailors whose adventures and misadventures in London's docklands provide the basis for lighthearted tales of working-class life. Jacobs was a master of the humorous short story and dialect writing, capturing the vernacular and spirit of maritime workers at the turn of the 20th century. While he is best known today for his horror story 'The Monkey's Paw,' the majority of his work consisted of these gentle comedies about sailors, night-watchmen, and dock workers. 'The Guardian Angel' is one story from this collection, demonstrating Jacobs' skill at character-driven humor and his affectionate portrayal of working-class camaraderie and conflict.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen is 1911, the publication date of the 'Ship's Company' collection. W.W. Jacobs (1863-1943) was an English author who wrote primarily in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, with his most productive years being roughly 1896-1926.

    <summarium>This work is a response by Norman Angell, author of the famous pacifist work &quot;The Great Illusion&quot; (1910), to the Balkan War of 1912. The text appears to be a pamphlet or essay addressing criticisms of pacifist theories in light of the outbreak of war in the Balkans. Angell examines how this conflict seemed to contradict peace theories, noting that it occurred despite efforts by rulers, diplomats, and financial powers to prevent it, and arose from the Balkan peoples' understanding of their own history and perceived duties. The work represents an important moment in early 20th century peace theory, written just before World War I would further challenge pacifist assumptions.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1912 is clearly stated on the title page and reflects the publication date, which is appropriate as this is a direct response to contemporary events (the First Balkan War began in October 1912). Norman Angell (1872-1967) was a British journalist and author who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1933. His most famous work, &quot;The Great Illusion&quot; (1910), argued that war was economically futile in the modern interconnected world - a theory that this pamphlet appears to be defending or reconsidering in light of the Balkan conflict.

    <summarium>'The White Waterfall' is an adventure novel by Australian-American writer James Francis Dwyer. Set in the South Pacific, it's a thrilling tale involving mysterious islands, dangerous expeditions, and colonial-era exploration.

This work is representative of early 20th-century adventure literature in the tradition of writers like H.

    <notae>James Francis Dwyer was an Australian-born author who moved to America and wrote extensively for popular magazines in the early 1900s. 'The White Waterfall' was published in 1912 and represents the adventure fiction genre popular in that era.

    <summarium>A reflective essay by Norman Angell, author of the influential 'The Great Illusion,' written in response to the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912. Angell examines his own theories about the futility of war in light of this conflict, which erupted despite diplomatic efforts and economic incentives for peace. The work grapples with the reality that war can emerge from peoples' understanding of their history and perceived duties rather than from ignorance or manipulation by press or financial interests. It represents an important moment of intellectual honesty as Angell confronts the limitations of purely economic arguments against war when faced with nationalist passions and historical grievances in the Balkans.

    <summarium>This is the eighth volume of a comprehensive Catholic history of England, originally written by John Lingard (1771-1851), a Catholic priest and historian whose work revolutionized English historiography by providing a scholarly, balanced Catholic perspective. This 1912 edition represents a collaboration with Hilaire Belloc and includes an introduction by Cardinal Gibbons. Volume VIII covers the reign of Charles I, including major Civil War events like the Battle of Edge Hill, various parliamentary negotiations, the Self-Denying Ordinance, and the trial and execution of Archbishop Laud. Lingard's original work (1819-1830) was groundbreaking for its use of primary sources and relatively objective treatment of controversial religious and political events in English history.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1912 is chosen because this is explicitly a revised/collaborative edition with Belloc's contributions and Cardinal Gibbons' introduction, making it a distinct work from Lingard's original 1819-1830 publication. The collaboration represents a continuation of Catholic historical scholarship into the early 20th century.

Maiju Lassila was the pseudonym of Algoth Untola (also known as Algoth Tietäväinen and Irmari Rantamala), a prolific Finnish writer known for his satirical and humorous works. The story appears to be a comedic narrative written in a colloquial, humorous Finnish style typical of Lassila's work, involving social interactions and romantic entanglements.

    <summarium>A collection of short stories by Richard Middleton (1882-1911), published posthumously. Middleton was a British author known for his supernatural and fantasy short stories with a distinctive melancholic and whimsical quality. His work often explores themes of loneliness, the search for meaning, and the thin boundary between the mundane and the fantastic. The collection includes the titular story &quot;The Ghost-Ship&quot; along with philosophical pieces like &quot;The Story of a Book&quot; and &quot;The Biography of a Superman&quot; which blur the line between essay and narrative fiction. Middleton tragically took his own life in Brussels at age 29, before achieving wider recognition. His work was championed posthumously by writers who recognized his unique voice and imaginative power.
</summarium>
    <notae>Richard Middleton died in 1911, and this collection was published posthumously in 1912. I've chosen 1912 as the year since this represents when the collection as a whole was published and made available to the public, rather than the individual composition dates of the stories. The preface mentions that Middleton is dead and refers to reading the volume in proof, indicating this was written by a friend or admirer preparing the work for publication after the author's death.

    <summarium>An anthology of English letters spanning five centuries (15th-19th), compiled by M. Duckitt and H. Wragg. The collection presents a diverse range of correspondence including 'gay, grave, frivolous, homely, religious, sociable, refined, philosophic, and feminine' letters, intended to showcase both the development of epistolary art and provide 'the proper study of mankind' through personal correspondence. The editors selected letters to present complete portraits of writers and to illuminate features of different ages, manners, and points of view. The collection traces the evolution of letter-writing from early formalities through the grace of the Augustan age to the more individualistic and sincere expression of later periods.
</summarium>
    <notae>1913 is the publication year of this anthology. Three letters in the collection were originally written in Latin. The editors modernized spelling and punctuation in some cases. This is an educational compilation rather than an original authored work.

    <summarium>'The Night-Born' is a collection of ten short stories by American author Jack London, published in 1913. The collection showcases London's characteristic exploration of human nature, violence, survival, and the primitive within civilization. The stories range from boxing matches to tales of adventure, reflecting London's naturalistic style and his fascination with the raw, primal aspects of human experience. Jack London (1876-1918) was one of the most popular American writers of the early 20th century, known for works like 'The Call of the Wild' and 'White Fang'. This collection represents his mature period as a short story writer.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen is 1913, the original publication date of this short story collection. While individual stories may have appeared in magazines earlier, 1913 is when they were collected and published together as 'The Night-Born'. This is the most historically accurate date for cataloging purposes. Note: 'catholic' tag not applied - Jack London was not Catholic and his works often reflected socialist and naturalist philosophies rather than Catholic themes.

    <summarium>Spalding's Official Baseball Guide was an annual publication that served as the authoritative reference for professional baseball statistics, rules, records, and commentary. The 1913 edition, edited by sportswriter John B. Foster, would have contained the official rules of baseball, team rosters, player statistics from the 1912 season, league standings, and articles about the state of the game. Published by the American Sports Publishing Company (owned by sporting goods magnate A.G. Spalding), these guides were the primary statistical and historical record of professional baseball during the early 20th century and are now invaluable primary sources for baseball historians studying the dead-ball era.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1913 is clearly indicated as this is the 1913 edition of an annual guide. This guide would have been published in early 1913 (likely spring) covering the 1912 baseball season and looking ahead to the 1913 season. The advertisement within mentions A.G. Spalding's book &quot;America's National Game,&quot; which was published in 1911, providing additional chronological context.

    <summarium>'El Choclo' is one of the most famous and iconic Argentine tangos, composed by Ángel Villoldo in 1903 (though this recording credits Manuel Sarrablo as composer, which may be an error or arrangement credit). This particular recording is a historic audio document performed by the National Promenade Band under conductor Eugene A. Jaudas, recorded in New York City on December 29, 1913. The recording represents an early example of tango music being performed and recorded in the United States, capturing the international spread of the Argentine tango during the early 20th century. As an instrumental musical recording, it has no lyrical content and is purely the performance of this famous tango melody.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1913 is chosen as it represents the actual recording date of this specific audio document. While 'El Choclo' was originally composed around 1903 by Ángel Villoldo (the authorship credit to Manuel Sarrablo in the Gutenberg text may be an error or refer to an arranger), this Gutenberg item is specifically the 1913 recording by the National Promenade Band, making 1913 the most historically accurate date for this particular artifact. This is an audio recording (MP3 format), not a text work.

The series follows the adventures of three young women who inherit their wealthy Aunt Jane's fortune and use it for various entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavors. This particular volume explores the nascent film industry in the 1910s and includes elements of mystery, adventure, and social commentary typical of early 20th century young adult fiction.

    <summarium>A firsthand eyewitness account by Flemish Belgian writer Jozef Muls documenting \
the siege and fall of Antwerp to German forces on October 10, 1914, during World \
War I. The work provides a detailed chronological narrative from the last days of \
peace through the German bombardment, the civilian experience during the siege, \
the chaos of evacuation, and the ultimate fall of the city. Written in Dutch, it \
captures the perspective of civilians caught in one of the major military \
engagements of the early months of WWI, including observations of the Zeppelin \
raids, the defense of the Belgian forts, the arrival of Cardinal Mercier, and the \
mass exodus of approximately 100,000 refugees. The work is considered an important \
primary source document of Belgian history and the civilian experience of WWI.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1914 as the year because this appears to be a contemporary account written \
during or immediately after the events described (the fall of Antwerp occurred on \
October 10, 1914). While the actual publication to print may have been in 1915, \
the work documents 1914 events and was likely composed in 1914. For historical \
timeline purposes, 1914 is the most accurate date as it represents when the events \
occurred and when the account was written. The Project Gutenberg number (11500) \
suggests this is a later digitization of the original work.

    <summarium>&quot;The Weaker Vessel&quot; is a humorous short story by W.W. Jacobs, part of his collection &quot;Night Watches&quot; published in 1914. The story follows Mr. Gribble, who arrives home to find his wife absent and no tea prepared—a domestic catastrophe that hasn't occurred in thirty years of marriage. Jacobs was known for his comic tales of everyday English life, particularly stories involving working-class characters, sailors, and domestic situations. His writing style combines gentle satire with warm humor, and his works were extremely popular in the early 20th century. This particular story appears to be a lighthearted exploration of marriage, gender roles, and domestic expectations in Edwardian England.
</summarium>
    <notae>W.W. Jacobs (William Wymark Jacobs, 1863-1943) published &quot;Night Watches&quot; in 1914. While he's perhaps best known today for his macabre story &quot;The Monkey's Paw,&quot; the bulk of his work consisted of humorous tales like this one. The year 1914 reflects the original publication date of the collection from which this story is drawn.

    <summarium>'The Uttermost Farthing' is a dark psychological crime novel by R. Austin Freeman, the creator of the forensic detective Dr. Thorndyke. The novel follows Humphrey Challoner, a scientist who embarks on an elaborate and methodical vendetta against criminals after a personal tragedy. Unlike Freeman's other works featuring Dr. Thorndyke, this is a standalone novel told from the perspective of the avenger himself, exploring themes of revenge, justice, and obsession. The narrative frame involves the protagonist's strange collection and his systematic pursuit of vengeance, pushing the boundaries of Victorian/Edwardian moral conventions. Freeman was known for pioneering the &quot;inverted detective story&quot; format and bringing scientific methodology to crime fiction.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1914. This is one of Freeman's darker works, departing from his usual Dr. Thorndyke series. The novel's ethical ambiguity and the narrator's &quot;abnormal outlook&quot; (as mentioned in the introduction) make it quite different from typical detective fiction of the era. Freeman (1862-1943) was a British physician who brought medical and scientific accuracy to the detective genre.

    <summarium>Beltane the Smith is a historical romance novel by Jeffery Farnol set in medieval England. It tells the story of Beltane, a smith who lives in the greenwood and becomes embroiled in adventure, love, and conflict. The novel features typical Farnol elements including chivalric romance, medieval atmosphere, and swashbuckling adventure. Farnol was known for his romanticized historical fiction written in an archaic style meant to evoke the medieval period. This work follows in the tradition of his earlier successes like 'The Broad Highway' and 'The Amateur Gentleman,' blending action, romance, and period detail.</summarium>
    <notae>The date is clearly marked in the dedication as 'London, August, 1915.' This is the original publication date. Farnol was a popular English novelist of the early 20th century who specialized in historical romances set in medieval and Georgian England. While Farnol may have had Christian influences, this is romantic adventure fiction rather than specifically Catholic literature, so it does not receive the 'catholic' tag.</notae>

    <summarium>This is an audio recording of 'Nataligino Kolo' (Christmas Kolo) performed by the Jugoslavensko Tamburasko Drustvo (Yugoslav Tamburitza Society). A kolo is a traditional Slavic circle dance, and this appears to be a Christmas-themed version. The tamburitza is a family of long-necked string instruments traditional to Southern Slavic peoples. This recording comes from the Thomas Edison collection at the Edison National Historic Site, representing an important piece of early 20th century immigrant musical heritage in America, as Yugoslav communities maintained their cultural traditions through such musical performances.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1915 is an educated estimate based on the context of Edison's recording activities and the period of Yugoslav immigration to America. Edison's phonograph recording activities were most active from the 1890s through the 1920s. Yugoslav tamburitza societies flourished in American immigrant communities during this period. Without access to the actual audio file or more specific dating information in the metadata, the exact recording date cannot be determined with certainty, but it likely falls somewhere between 1900-1925.

    <summarium>This work examines George Washington's life as a farmer and agricultural innovator at Mount Vernon. Paul Leland Haworth, an American historian, presents Washington not in his familiar role as military commander or first president, but as a dedicated agriculturalist who pioneered farming techniques and managed extensive estates. The book explores Washington's home life, his agricultural experiments, crop rotation practices, and his efforts to improve American farming methods. Washington was deeply committed to scientific agriculture and corresponded with agricultural societies in England. This biographical work provides insight into the domestic and agrarian aspects of Washington's character, showing him as a practical man of the land who approached farming with the same methodical care he applied to military and political affairs.
</summarium>
    <notae>Paul Leland Haworth (1876-1936) was an American historian who wrote several works on American history. &quot;George Washington: Farmer&quot; was first published in 1915. This date represents the original publication year of Haworth's historical study, not the period of Washington's life it describes (Washington lived 1732-1799). The work is a scholarly examination written in the early 20th century about Washington's 18th-century agricultural pursuits.

    <summarium>'Der Mann im Nebel' (The Man in the Fog) is a novel by Gustav Falke, a Hamburg-based German writer known for his lyrical prose and poetry depicting Northern German life. Published in 1916, the year of Falke's death, this appears to be one of his final works. The novel is dedicated to his friends Karl Ernst Knodt and Frau Käthe, and begins with an epistolary format, opening with a letter addressed to 'Liebster Doktor' (Dearest Doctor).

    <summarium>A collection of three Irish plays by Padraic Colum, a leading figure in the Irish Literary Revival and the Irish National Theatre movement. Written for the National Theatre Society in the early 1900s, these plays explore Irish rural life, family dynamics, and social conflicts. &quot;The Land&quot; celebrates the Land Act of 1903 which transferred Irish land from landlords to peasants, while also examining emigration to America. &quot;The Fiddler's House&quot; explores the conflict between individual aspirations and family obligations. These plays were written for a small stage and an audience deeply invested in expressions of Irish national character during a pivotal period of Irish cultural and political awakening.
</summarium>
    <notae>The plays were written in the early 1900s (circa 1903-1910) for the Irish National Theatre Society, but this collected edition was published in 1916. Colum was a contemporary of W.B.

The series popularized the 'Yellow Peril' thriller genre in early 20th century literature, depicting exotic Oriental villainy against Western heroes. While the books were enormously popular in their time, they are now recognized as products of their era's problematic racial stereotypes and Orientalist attitudes. The series follows the ongoing attempts of the protagonists to thwart Fu-Manchu's elaborate criminal schemes and world domination plans.

    <notae>The novel was originally serialized in Collier's magazine in 1916 before book publication. This is the second book in what would become a long-running series. The first book, 'The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu' (also known as 'The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu'), was published in 1913. While hugely influential on the thriller and mystery genres, these works reflect the racial prejudices and anxieties of the early 20th century British Empire period.

    <summarium>'Wee Macgreegor Enlists' is a novel by Scottish author J.J. Bell, part of his popular series about the character Wee Macgreegor (MacGregor), a Glasgow boy whose adventures were told in Scottish dialect. This installment, published during World War I, follows MacGregor as he enlists in the military. The book captures the home front experience and the transition from civilian to military life during the Great War, written with Bell's characteristic humor and warmth. The series was extremely popular in Scotland and gave readers a glimpse into working-class Glasgow life through dialect fiction. The chapter titles suggest a romantic subplot alongside the military storyline.

    <notae>1916 is the clear publication year for this edition. J.J. Bell's Wee Macgreegor series began earlier (the first book was published in 1902), but this specific war-time installment was published in 1916 during World War I, making it both a work of fiction and a period piece reflecting contemporary events.

    <summarium>This is a collection of two Western short stories by Eugene Manlove Rhodes, one of the most celebrated writers of the American West. Rhodes was known for his authentic portrayal of cowboys and ranch life in New Mexico and the Southwest. &quot;The Desire of the Moth&quot; is the lead story, featuring John Wesley Pringle in the landscape around the Organ Mountains of New Mexico. Rhodes' work is characterized by literate cowboys, vivid descriptions of the Western landscape, and a romantic but realistic portrayal of frontier life. His stories often featured themes of honor, loyalty, and the code of the West, written with literary sophistication uncommon in Western fiction of the era.
</summarium>
    <notae>&quot;The Desire of the Moth&quot; was first published in 1916, along with &quot;The Come On&quot; in a single volume by Henry Holt and Company. Rhodes wrote most of his work between 1900-1930, and this represents his mature period. He is sometimes called the &quot;novelist laureate of the cattle range&quot; and his work influenced later Western writers. The year 1916 represents the original book publication of these two stories together.

He was the grandson of Ernest Renan, the famous anti-clerical philosopher, which made his own conversion to Catholicism in 1913 particularly significant to his contemporaries. Psichari served in the French colonial army in the Congo and Mauritania, and wrote autobiographical works about military life. After his conversion, he considered becoming a priest but decided to serve the Church through his military vocation instead. He was killed at the Battle of Rossignol in Belgium on August 22, 1914, at age 30. Massis's biography documents Psichari's spiritual journey and military career, portraying him as a Catholic soldier-intellectual.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1916 is the publication date of this biography by Henri Massis, published by l'Art Catholique in Paris. This is appropriate since the work is Massis's biographical account written after Psichari's death, not Psichari's own writings. The biography would have received ecclesiastical approval given its publication by a Catholic publisher and its subject matter celebrating a Catholic convert.

    <summarium>'The Land of Deepening Shadow' is a firsthand account of Germany during World War I, written by British-American journalist D. Thomas Curtin. The book provides a critical examination of German society, propaganda, military operations, and civilian life during the war years. Curtin offers observations on various aspects of wartime Germany including censorship, propaganda machinery, submarine warfare, treatment of occupied territories, and the suppression of dissent. The work is dedicated to Lord Northcliffe, the influential British newspaper magnate who was instrumental in British wartime propaganda efforts. It represents Allied wartime journalism aimed at exposing conditions in Germany to English-speaking audiences.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year of 1917 is straightforward as it appears on the title page. This work was written and published during World War I itself, making it a contemporaneous account rather than a historical retrospective. Curtin's observations were made while the war was still ongoing, giving the work immediate propaganda value for the Allied cause. The book is clearly not appropriate for children given its wartime subject matter and propagandistic nature. It is not tagged as 'catholic' as there is no indication the author was Catholic or that the work has any particular Catholic perspective—it is primarily political/journalistic war reporting.

    <summarium>The Adventures of Jimmie Dale is an early crime adventure novel featuring one of the first masked hero archetypes in popular fiction. The protagonist, Jimmie Dale, is a wealthy New York socialite who secretly operates as &quot;The Gray Seal,&quot; a mysterious vigilante who solves crimes and rights wrongs while leaving his signature gray seal as a calling card. The novel combines elements of mystery, adventure, and romance, and was highly influential in establishing tropes later used in pulp fiction and superhero stories. Packard's creation predated characters like The Shadow and influenced the development of the vigilante hero archetype in American popular culture.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1917, though it was serialized in People's Magazine beginning in 1914. I've used the 1917 book publication date as it represents the complete work. This was the first of several Jimmie Dale novels by Packard, establishing a popular series in the early 20th century.

    <summarium>Punch was Britain's most famous and long-running humor and satire magazine, published from 1841 to 1992. This issue from November 14, 1917, comes from the final year of World War I and contains typical Punch content: satirical commentary on current events, humorous observations about British society and politics, jokes about wartime conditions, and witty social commentary. The &quot;Charivaria&quot; section shown here features brief humorous observations about the Foreign Office, spy cases, street crime, and wartime bread rationing. Punch was influential in British culture and known for coining terms like &quot;cartoon&quot; in its modern sense.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen is 1917, the actual publication date of this specific issue. While Punch magazine began in 1841, this is a single dated issue from WWI-era Britain. The content includes wartime references such as spies, rationing, and Sir Arthur Yapp (a prominent wartime administrator). Not appropriate for children due to some of the humor being contextual to adult topics of the era.

    <summarium>This is an audio recording of the jazz/ragtime standard &quot;Dixieland&quot; (also known as &quot;Original Dixieland One-Step&quot;) performed by Lopez and Hamilton's Kings of Harmony. The recording comes from the Edison National Historic Site archives and represents early 20th century American popular music. The Original Dixieland Jass Band first recorded &quot;Dixieland Jass Band One-Step&quot; in 1917, which became one of the first jazz recordings ever made and a landmark in American music history. This Project Gutenberg entry preserves this historical audio recording in MP3 format.
</summarium>
    <notae>I've chosen 1917 as the year because that's when &quot;Dixieland&quot; (the Original Dixieland One-Step) was first recorded and became a foundational work in jazz history. While this specific performance by Lopez and Hamilton's Kings of Harmony may have been recorded slightly later (Edison made many recordings in the late 1910s-1920s), the work itself dates to 1917. For a historical timeline focused on when works entered cultural consciousness, 1917 is the most educationally appropriate date as it marks the birth of recorded jazz. If more specific recording date information for this particular Lopez and Hamilton performance were available, that could refine this estimate to perhaps 1917-1920.

    <summarium>'La veille d'armes' (The Eve of Battle) is a five-act play by French authors Claude Farrère and Lucien Népoty. The play was first performed at the Théâtre du Gymnase on January 5, 1917, during World War I. Claude Farrère (1876-1957) was a French naval officer and writer who won the Prix Goncourt in 1905 and was elected to the Académie française. Lucien Népoty (1885-1918) was a French playwright and poet who died in combat during WWI. The play's title suggests themes related to war and the anticipation before battle, which would have resonated strongly with French audiences during the Great War. As a theatrical work from this period, it likely reflects the concerns, anxieties, and patriotic sentiments of wartime France.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1917 represents the first performance date at the Théâtre du Gymnase, which is the most historically significant date for this theatrical work. This is a collaborative work between two authors, written and performed during World War I.

    <summarium>A novel by Canadian author Isabel Ecclestone Mackay (1875-1928), who was a popular poet and novelist in the early 20th century. The book appears to be a pastoral narrative, suggested by the opening scene of a traveler on a country road encountering a small boy near a swimming pool. The dedication to the author's mother and the cheerful tone suggest this may be a wholesome story of rural life or a journey narrative. Mackay was known for her accessible, optimistic writing style that often celebrated nature and simple pleasures.
</summarium>
    <notae>Isabel Ecclestone Mackay was a prominent Canadian literary figure who wrote both poetry and prose. This novel appears to have been published during World War I, though its pastoral setting suggests an escape from contemporary troubles. The year 1917 is based on publication records for this work, though exact dating can vary between Canadian and American editions.

    <summarium>'Plays of Gods and Men' is a collection of four one-act and short plays by Lord Dunsany (Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany), one of the most influential fantasy writers of the early 20th century. The collection includes 'The Tents of the Arabs', 'The Laughter of the Gods', 'A Night at an Inn', and 'The Queen's Enemies'. Written between 1910-1913, these plays showcase Dunsany's characteristic mythopoeic style, blending elements of ancient mythology, exotic settings, and cosmic irony. His work influenced later fantasy and weird fiction writers including H.P. Lovecraft. The plays feature imaginary kingdoms, gods, prophets, and mortals caught in tragic or darkly humorous situations, often exploring themes of hubris, fate, and the relationship between humanity and the divine.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1917 as the year because this is when the Unwin edition was first published in the UK, which is the edition indicated in the preface note. While the individual plays were written between 1910-1913 (as Dunsany meticulously documents in his preface, written while serving as a Captain in WWI), the collection as a whole was published in 1917. Lord Dunsany was Anglo-Irish and not Catholic - he came from a Protestant Irish aristocratic family - so the 'catholic' tag is not included despite his Irish heritage.

    <summarium>&quot;This Is The End&quot; is a semi-autobiographical novel by English writer Stella Benson, published during World War I. The work is characteristic of early modernist fiction, featuring philosophical reflections on the arbitrary nature of reality and social conventions. The narrator introduces Jay, a bus-conductor and idealist who questions fundamental assumptions about life. The novel explores themes of uncertainty, idealism, and social observation during a time of upheaval. Benson was known for her unconventional narrative style and feminist perspectives, and this work reflects her skeptical view of established social norms and her interest in characters who exist outside conventional society.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1917 is straightforward as it appears in the text itself and matches historical records for the first publication of this novel. Stella Benson (1892-1933) was an English modernist writer who is somewhat forgotten today but was respected in her time for her innovative prose style and social commentary.

    <summarium>&quot;Growth of the Soil&quot; (Markens Grøde) is Knut Hamsun's epic novel about pioneer life in rural Norway. The story follows Isak, a solitary man who settles in the wilderness and through immense labor transforms uncultivated land into a productive farm. The novel traces his life as he builds a home, cultivates the soil, and eventually raises a family in the harsh but beautiful landscape. Hamsun won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920, and this novel is considered one of his greatest achievements. It celebrates the relationship between man and nature, the dignity of agricultural labor, and the primal connection between human beings and the earth. The work is notable for its lyrical prose and deep reverence for the land and those who work it.

    <summarium>A progressive era examination of the relationship between education, creativity, and industrial labor. Helen Marot, a labor activist and writer, explores how educational systems can better serve workers and foster creative impulses within industrial environments. The work is associated with the Bureau of Educational Experiments, a group dedicated to scientific approaches to modern education, and is dedicated to Caroline Pratt, founder of the City and Country School. The book represents early 20th century progressive educational reform thinking, arguing for educational environments that promote growth and creativity rather than rote industrial training.

Altsheler was a prolific American author of historical adventure novels for young readers in the early 20th century. This series dramatizes the conflict between British and French forces in colonial North America (1754-1763), incorporating both historical events and fictional characters. The novels are known for their fast-paced action, wilderness settings in the Great North Woods, and portrayal of Native American allies on both sides of the conflict.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year 1918 is straightforward as this is an original work of early 20th century historical fiction, not a republication or translation of an older text. Altsheler wrote these adventure novels specifically for young American readers during the World War I era, romanticizing America's colonial past.

The book emerged from a series of public lectures given in fall 1914 explaining the complex political, ethnic, and territorial conflicts that made the war 'inevitable.' It aims to explain European conditions—particularly the ethnic tensions and nationalistic movements absent in America's melting pot—through simple language, maps, and charts.

    <summarium>&quot;The Roll-Call&quot; is a novel by Arnold Bennett, one of the major English novelists of the early 20th century. Bennett is best known for his detailed, realistic portrayals of life in the industrial &quot;Five Towns&quot; region of Staffordshire. &quot;The Roll-Call&quot; was written during World War I and deals with themes related to the war period and its impact on British society. The novel follows the life of an architect and explores the social and personal changes brought about by the Great War. Bennett was a highly prolific writer known for his naturalistic style and careful attention to the details of everyday middle-class life.
</summarium>
    <notae>&quot;The Roll-Call&quot; was first published in 1918. This date reflects both the original composition and publication during the final year of World War I, which is thematically significant to the novel's content and historical context.

    <summarium>'The Title' is a satirical comedy in three acts by Arnold Bennett, written during World War I. The play satirizes the British social obsession with aristocratic titles and honors. Set in the well-furnished West End home of the Culver family over the course of a few days between Christmas and New Year, the play explores the family's reactions and social maneuvering around the prospect of receiving a title. Bennett uses the situation to lampoon the pretensions and vanities of the British middle and upper classes, examining themes of social climbing, family dynamics, and the absurdity of the honors system. The play is characteristic of Bennett's sharp social observation and wit.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year of 1918 (MCMXVIII in the copyright notice) represents the original publication date of this play. This was during the latter part of World War I, when honors and titles were being distributed more liberally, making it a particularly timely satire. Bennett was known for his realistic and often satirical portrayals of English society.

This audio document captures the Friscoe &quot;Jass&quot; Band performing &quot;Johnson 'Jass' Blues,&quot; representing the early development of jazz music in America. The spelling &quot;jass&quot; reflects the transitional period before &quot;jazz&quot; became the standard terminology for the genre. As an Edison recording, this represents an important artifact in both the history of jazz music and the history of sound recording technology.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1918 is estimated based on several factors: Thomas Edison's active period recording jazz music (primarily 1917-1920), the use of &quot;jass&quot; spelling which was most common 1916-1918, and the general context of early jazz recordings. This is an audio recording rather than a traditional text, representing a historical sound document from the early jazz era. The exact recording date may vary but would fall within the late 1910s period.

This volume from June 1919 represents the immediate post-WWI period, with its characteristic blend of social commentary, jokes, and observations on contemporary British life. The magazine featured contributions from numerous writers and cartoonists over its long history.</summarium>
    <notae>Year 1919 represents the actual publication date of this specific issue (June 11, 1919). As a periodical, each issue has its own publication date, making this straightforward. The content reflects post-World War I British society and humor. Not marked as 'appropriate-for-children' as the satirical humor and references would be more suited to adult readers, though not inappropriate per se. Not marked as 'catholic' as Punch was a secular British publication with diverse contributors, though some contributors may have been Catholic.</notae>

    <summarium>This is the eighth book in the Camp Fire Girls series by Hildegard G. Frey, officially endorsed by the Camp Fire Girls organization. The Camp Fire Girls was a youth organization founded in 1910 to provide outdoor activities and character development for girls, similar to the Boy Scouts. This particular volume was published during World War I, and the title reflects the patriotic themes of the era - &quot;Do Their Bit&quot; was a common phrase for home front war efforts, while &quot;Over the Top&quot; was military slang for going into battle from the trenches. The Winnebagos are the name of the particular Camp Fire Girls group featured in this series. The book follows the adventures and character development of the girls as they contribute to the war effort on the home front.
</summarium>
    <notae>The 1919 publication date is clearly stated in the book's copyright page. This was published during the final year of WWI and reflects the patriotic fervor of the era. The Camp Fire Girls organization was a real, non-denominational youth organization, so this does not qualify for the 'catholic' tag despite being wholesome period literature.

    <summarium>This groundbreaking work by Carter G. Woodson, known as the 'Father of Black History,' documents the largely unknown history of educational efforts among enslaved and free Black Americans before the Civil War. Woodson discovered that the struggle for education among Black Americans during slavery was more extensive and heroic than previously documented. The book examines how both Black and white benevolent teachers worked to educate African Americans under the most adverse circumstances, including legal prohibitions in many states. This scholarly work filled a significant gap in historical literature, as previous works had only touched on specific localities or aspects of this history. The preface indicates this was meant to be part of a larger project on Negro education but became focused on the ante-bellum period due to the compelling nature of the source material.</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1919 is the publication date as stated in the text. This work represents early 20th-century historical scholarship on African American education and was published during a period when Woodson was establishing the field of Black history as a legitimate academic discipline. The work is not classified as 'appropriate-for-children' due to its scholarly nature and difficult subject matter, nor as 'catholic' as it is a secular historical work.</notae>

    <summarium>The International Jewish Cook Book is a comprehensive kosher cookbook containing 1600 recipes according to Jewish dietary laws (kashrut), including rules for kashering. It represents the culinary traditions of Jewish communities across multiple countries including America, Austria, Germany, Russia, France, Poland, and Romania. The book was positioned as the successor to the popular &quot;Aunt Babette Cook Book&quot; and was compiled by Florence Kreisler Greenbaum, an instructor in cooking and domestic science who specialized in Jewish dietary laws. As a household efficiency expert and graduate of Hunter College, Greenbaum brought scientific knowledge of food chemistry and diet to traditional Jewish cooking. The book served as both a practical cooking guide and a preservation of international Jewish culinary heritage during the early 20th century.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1919 is clearly indicated as the publication date of the second edition shown in this text. This was published in the aftermath of World War I, during a period of significant Jewish immigration to America, making such a comprehensive international Jewish cookbook particularly relevant for preserving and sharing culinary traditions across diaspora communities.

    <summarium>'Jungle Tales of Tarzan' is a collection of twelve short stories featuring Tarzan in his youth, before he left the jungle and encountered civilization. Published in 1919, these tales explore Tarzan's formative years among the great apes, his first romantic feelings, encounters with witch doctors, battles with jungle predators, and his developing understanding of the world around him. The stories fill in backstory between Burroughs' first Tarzan novel and its sequel, showing the ape-man's growth from adolescence to young adulthood. The collection includes adventures like 'Tarzan's First Love,' 'The Capture of Tarzan,' and whimsical tales like 'Tarzan Rescues the Moon.'

    <summarium>'Between You and Me' is a collection of writings by Sir Harry Lauder, the beloved Scottish entertainer and music hall performer, published during World War I. The book is dedicated to the fathers and mothers of soldiers who served or prepared to serve in the Great War. Lauder, whose only son Captain John Lauder was killed in action in 1916, became a passionate advocate for the war effort and toured extensively to support troops and raise morale. This work captures his reflections and sentiments during this tumultuous period, blending his characteristic warmth and humor with the gravity of wartime experience. The included poem &quot;One of the Boys Who Went&quot; reflects the pride and sacrifice of WWI service members.

Hope is best known for his Ruritanian romances 'The Prisoner of Zenda' (1894) and 'Rupert of Hentzau' (1898). This later work appears to be a post-World War I mystery involving characters including Doctor Mary (suggesting a female physician, which was progressive for the era), a General, Captain Alec, and Mr. Saffron, centered around some secret associated with a tower. The chapter titles suggest intrigue, secrets, and possibly themes related to the aftermath of WWI, including references to Morocco and military characters, reflecting the geopolitical concerns of the immediate post-war period.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen is 1919, the original publication date clearly stated in the text itself. This is a straightforward case with no ambiguity about editions or translations.

    <summarium>&quot;The Second Book of Modern Verse&quot; is an anthology of modern poetry edited by Jessie Belle Rittenhouse (1869-1948), an American poet, critic, and anthologist. This is a sequel to her earlier anthology &quot;The Little Book of Modern Verse&quot; (1913), which was highly successful. Rittenhouse was known for her role in promoting modern American poetry in the early 20th century and served as the first secretary of the Poetry Society of America. This collection features contemporary poets of the early 20th century, showcasing the evolution of American and British verse during the modernist period. The anthology helped introduce readers to the &quot;new poetry&quot; movement and includes works that represented a departure from Victorian conventions toward more contemporary forms and themes.
</summarium>
    <notae>&quot;The Second Book of Modern Verse&quot; was first published in 1919 by Houghton Mifflin Company. This was Rittenhouse's follow-up to her enormously popular 1913 anthology &quot;The Little Book of Modern Verse.&quot; The 1919 date represents the original publication year of this specific anthology, which captured the state of modern poetry following World War I. As an anthology, this work compiles poems by various authors rather than being authored by Rittenhouse herself, though her editorial selection and arrangement represent significant curatorial work in shaping American poetry taste during this period.

    <summarium>This is a first-hand historical account by W.T. Massey, who served as the official correspondent of the London newspapers with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during World War I. The book chronicles General Edmund Allenby's successful military campaign in Palestine that culminated in the capture of Jerusalem from the Ottoman Empire in December 1917. Massey describes this as &quot;the twenty-third fall of Jerusalem&quot; and covers the campaign from the Gaza-Beersheba line through to the occupation of Jericho, which secured Jerusalem from any Turkish counterattack. The work provides detailed military history of what Massey calls &quot;one of the most beneficent happenings of all wars,&quot; ending four centuries of Ottoman rule over the Holy City. The preface indicates this is the first volume, with a planned second volume to cover the subsequent campaign that drove Turkish forces entirely out of the war.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year of 1919 is clearly stated on the title page. This is a contemporary historical account written immediately after the events it describes (the Jerusalem campaign occurred in 1917). As an official war correspondent's account, it represents primary source material for World War I's Middle Eastern theater. The work is not tagged as 'catholic' despite the religious significance of Jerusalem, as it is primarily a military history written from a British imperial perspective rather than a religious treatise.

    <summarium>This is a juvenile adventure novel from the 'Air Service Boys' series, written during the golden age of aviation adventure fiction for young readers. Published in 1920, just after World War I, the book capitalizes on the public's fascination with aviation and the heroic exploits of military aviators. The story follows young aviators in various aerial adventures, including combat missions, rescues, and ultimately an ambitious transatlantic flight. These books were part of a broader genre of series fiction for boys that emphasized courage, patriotism, and technological progress. Charles Amory Beach was a pseudonym used for this series, which was likely produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate or similar publisher of formulaic juvenile series books.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1920 is the original publication date shown on the title page. This timing is significant as it immediately follows WWI (ended 1918) and precedes Lindbergh's famous solo transatlantic flight by seven years (1927), though the first successful transatlantic flight was accomplished by Alcock and Brown in 1919. The book likely drew inspiration from real aviation achievements of the era while providing adventure fiction for young readers fascinated by the new technology of flight.

    <summarium>The Night Horseman is a Western novel by Max Brand (pseudonym of Frederick Faust), one of the most prolific and popular Western writers of the early 20th century. This novel is part of a trilogy featuring the character Dan Barry (along with &quot;The Untamed&quot; and &quot;Trailin'&quot;). The story follows the mysterious and enigmatic Dan Barry, a wild, almost supernatural figure who has an uncanny connection with his horse and a wolf. The novel explores themes of civilization versus wildness, human nature, and the mythic Western frontier. Max Brand's work was known for its romantic, larger-than-life characters and adventure-driven plots that helped define the Western genre in popular fiction.
</summarium>
    <notae>The copyright date of 1920 is clearly stated in the text header. Max Brand was the most famous pen name of Frederick Schiller Faust (1892-1944), who wrote prolifically in multiple genres but is best remembered for his Westerns. While Faust himself was raised Catholic, his popular Western fiction was commercial genre work rather than explicitly Catholic literature, so the 'catholic' tag is not applied.

    <summarium>A firsthand military account by Colonel John Ward, C.B., C.M.G., M.P., of the British military expedition to Siberia during the Russian Civil War (1918-1920). Ward commanded battalions of the Middlesex Regiment (the 'Die-Hards') during the Allied intervention in Siberia following the Russian Revolution. The work documents military operations, political complexities, and the chaotic situation in Russia during this period. Originally written as a personal narrative for his sons in case he did not return, it provides valuable primary source material on the Allied intervention in Russia and the tumultuous post-WWI period in Siberia.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1920 is the publication year stated in the text itself. This is a contemporary account written shortly after the events described (the Siberian intervention of 1918-1920), making it a valuable primary historical source rather than a later historical analysis. The author explicitly notes in his forward that he wrote of events as they occurred and recorded motivations in real-time, which gives the work its documentary value despite what he acknowledges as limitations in historical perspective.

    <summarium>'The Three Taverns' is a collection of poems by Edwin Arlington Robinson, one of America's most distinguished early 20th-century poets. Robinson was known for his psychological depth, narrative skill, and exploration of New England characters and themes. This collection includes various poems dealing with historical, biblical, and contemporary subjects, including the title poem 'The Three Taverns' (referring to the biblical location where Paul met fellow Christians on his way to Rome), 'The Wandering Jew', and 'John Brown'. Robinson's work is characterized by its formal mastery, psychological insight, and often dark or ironic tone. He would go on to win three Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry (1922, 1925, 1928), though not for this particular volume.
</summarium>
    <notae>'The Three Taverns' was first published in 1920 by Macmillan. Robinson (1869-1935) was born in Maine and is considered a transitional figure between 19th-century romanticism and 20th-century modernism. The work is dedicated to Thomas Sergeant Perry (a scholar and critic) and his wife Lilla Cabot Perry (an accomplished painter and poet).

The work reflects early 20th-century progressive education movements, particularly influenced by Froebelian pedagogy, which emphasized child-centered learning and natural development. The inclusion of a quote from Thomas Traherne, the 17th-century English poet and theologian, suggests a philosophical approach to understanding childhood consciousness and learning.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1920 is clearly stated on the title page and represents the original publication date. This work was part of a broader educational reform movement in early 20th-century Britain. The Maria Grey Training College was a significant institution for women's teacher training, and Goldsmiths' College remains a prestigious educational institution. The Froebelian influence mentioned (Friedrich Froebel founded the kindergarten movement) indicates this work bridges 19th-century educational philosophy with 20th-century practice.

    <summarium>Clerambault is a semi-autobiographical work by Nobel Prize-winning French author Romain Rolland, written during and immediately after World War I. The book explores the inner struggles of a pacifist intellectual during wartime, tracing his journey from initial patriotic fervor to opposition to the war. Rolland uses the character of Clerambault to examine themes of conscience, independent thinking, and moral courage in the face of social pressure and nationalism. The work reflects Rolland's own pacifist stance during WWI, which made him controversial in France. It's described by the author as &quot;the confession of a free spirit&quot; rather than a straightforward novel, blending narrative with philosophical meditation in the tradition of French moralists.
</summarium>
    <notae>The original French edition was published in 1920. This English translation by Katherine Miller appeared in 1921. I chose 1920 as the year since that represents the original publication of the work. Rolland was not a Catholic author - he was influenced by Tolstoy's philosophy, Indian spirituality, and humanist ideals, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply.

    <summarium>'Second April' is Edna St. Vincent Millay's second major poetry collection, published in 1921. The collection showcases Millay's mastery of both traditional and modern poetic forms, including sonnets, elegies, and free verse. The poems explore themes of mortality, loss, the transience of beauty, the passage of seasons, and the tension between earthly beauty and deeper spiritual or existential needs. The opening poem &quot;Spring&quot; famously declares &quot;Beauty is not enough,&quot; setting the tone for a collection that grapples with disillusionment and the search for meaning beyond aesthetic pleasure. The work was dedicated to her friend Caroline B. Dow, who had been instrumental in supporting Millay's education at Vassar College. This collection helped establish Millay as one of the foremost American poets of her generation.

    <notae>Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950) was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1923, becoming the third woman to receive this honor.

    <summarium>Casey Ryan is a Western novel by B. M. Bower (pen name of Bertha Muzzy Sinclair), published in 1921. The story follows the adventures of Casey Ryan, a colorful stagecoach driver known throughout the American West for his daring exploits. The novel opens with tales of Casey's tumultuous youth driving six-horse stages out of Cripple Creek, Colorado, racing past would-be holdups with characteristic recklessness. B. M. Bower was one of the first women to make a career writing Western fiction, and her works were known for their humor, realistic portrayal of ranch life, and memorable characters.
</summarium>
    <notae>1921 is the original publication year as indicated in the text itself. B. M. Bower (1871-1940) was a prolific and influential Western fiction author who published over 60 novels. This work represents the lighter, more humorous side of Western fiction popular in the early 20th century.

    <summarium>&quot;Red Masquerade&quot; is a novel by Louis Joseph Vance featuring the character known as &quot;The Lone Wolf&quot; and his daughter. Vance was a prolific American novelist and short story writer who created the popular Lone Wolf character - Michael Lanyard, a jewel thief turned detective. This particular installment focuses on the daughter of the Lone Wolf protagonist. The work was originally created as a motion picture scenario in 1919, then adapted into a novel published in 1921. It represents the adventure-mystery genre popular in early 20th century American fiction, combining elements of crime, romance, and international intrigue that characterized Vance's Lone Wolf series.
</summarium>
    <notae>The text clearly states publication year as 1921 in the title page. The author's apology note indicates this novel was adapted from a motion picture produced in autumn 1919, then serialized in The Pictorial Review before book publication. The dedication date of December 31, 1920 suggests the book was prepared for 1921 publication.

    <summarium>'By Advice of Counsel' is a collection of legal fiction stories featuring the adventures of Mr. Ephraim Tutt, one of the most beloved fictional lawyers in American literature. Arthur Train (1875-1945) was himself a lawyer and former Assistant District Attorney in New York, and he created the character of Mr. Tutt as a wise, humanitarian lawyer who defends the underdog with cleverness and moral integrity. The stories blend courtroom drama with humor and social commentary, portraying the American legal system of the early 20th century. The Tutt &amp; Tutt stories were enormously popular in their time and appeared in The Saturday Evening Post before being collected into books.
</summarium>
    <notae>This collection was first published in 1921. Arthur Train wrote numerous Mr. Tutt stories and novels between 1919 and 1943. 'By Advice of Counsel' was one of the early collections in the series. The exact publication year is based on the original book publication date.

    <summarium>Bull Hunter is a western novel by Max Brand (pen name of Frederick Faust), one of the most prolific writers of western fiction in American literature. The story follows its titular character through the rough frontier life of the American West. Max Brand was known for creating memorable characters and fast-paced adventure stories that defined the western genre in the early 20th century. This novel exemplifies his style of combining action, character development, and the harsh beauty of the western landscape. The opening scene with the Campbell brothers struggling to remove a tree stump at high altitude immediately establishes the rugged setting and the physical challenges faced by the characters.
</summarium>
    <notae>1921 is the original publication year. Max Brand (Frederick Faust, 1892-1944) wrote under numerous pseudonyms and produced an enormous body of work, primarily westerns. While his stories are generally suitable for young readers in terms of language and themes, they do contain typical western violence and frontier conflict.

    <summarium>A historical analysis of chemical warfare and Germany's chemical industry written by British officer Victor LeFebure, who served in the Chemical Warfare Service during World War I. The book examines the development and use of chemical weapons during WWI, particularly by Germany, and discusses the strategic implications of the chemical industry for both military and peacetime purposes. It provides insight into early 20th century chemical warfare, industrial policy, and the geopolitical concerns surrounding Germany's scientific and industrial capabilities in the aftermath of the Great War.

    <summarium>This is Edward Sapir's foundational work in linguistics, one of the most influential books in the field. Sapir (1884-1939) was a pioneering American linguist and anthropologist who made fundamental contributions to the study of language, particularly in relation to culture and thought. In this accessible introduction, Sapir explores the nature of language, its variability across time and space, and its relationships to thought, history, race, culture, and art. The work is notable for its philosophical depth and for articulating what would later be developed into the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis about linguistic relativity. Sapir emphasizes the unconscious nature of linguistic structure and its diagnostic value for understanding human psychology and cultural evolution. Written for both specialists and general readers, the book avoids technical jargon while providing profound insights into the fundamental role of language in human life.
</summarium>
    <notae>The book was first published in 1921, as indicated both in the text and by the publication date shown. The '1939' date that appears may refer to a later edition or reprint, possibly connected to Sapir's death in 1939. For historical and educational purposes, 1921 is the most appropriate year as it marks when this influential work first appeared and began shaping the field of linguistics.

    <summarium>Tales of Lonely Trails is a collection of adventure narratives by Zane Grey, the famous author of Western novels. This work represents Grey's non-fiction writings about his actual outdoor expeditions in the American West. The book includes accounts of his travels through remote wilderness areas including explorations of Nonnezoshe (Rainbow Bridge), Colorado trails, lion hunting expeditions in the Grand Canyon, adventures in the Tonto Basin, and Death Valley. Grey was an avid outdoorsman and conservationist, and these tales reflect his genuine experiences exploring some of the most isolated and spectacular landscapes of the American Southwest in the early 20th century. The work combines adventure narrative with nature writing and gives readers a glimpse into the wild frontier that was rapidly disappearing during Grey's lifetime.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1922 is clearly indicated in the text itself and represents the original publication date of this collection. Zane Grey (1872-1939) was primarily known for his Western fiction novels, but he also wrote extensively about his real outdoor adventures. While Grey was not a Catholic author, these adventure tales are wholesome and appropriate for general audiences including children interested in nature and exploration.

    <summarium>'Books &amp; Characters: French &amp; English' is a collection of literary essays by Lytton Strachey, a prominent member of the Bloomsbury Group and one of the most influential English critics and biographers of the early 20th century. The volume contains fourteen essays examining various literary figures from both French and English traditions, spanning from the Elizabethan period to the 19th century. Subjects include Racine, Shakespeare, Sir Thomas Browne, William Blake, Voltaire (multiple essays), Rousseau, Madame du Deffand, Samuel Johnson's 'Lives of the Poets', Stendhal (Henri Beyle), and Lady Hester Stanhope. The collection showcases Strachey's characteristic wit, psychological insight, and elegant prose style. Many of these essays were previously published in periodicals such as the Independent Review, the New Quarterly, the Athenaeum, and the Edinburgh Review. The volume notably includes what is described as a previously unpublished dialogue manuscript in Voltaire's handwriting from his English period.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year is straightforward as this is an original work first published in May 1922. Strachey (1880-1932) was not Catholic and his work would not typically align with Catholic literary standards, so the 'catholic' tag is not applicable. The work is sophisticated literary criticism aimed at educated adult readers, so 'appropriate-for-children' is not included.

    <summarium>This is a pioneering work in popular endocrinology by Dr. Louis Berman, who was an associate in biological chemistry at Columbia University. The book explores the relationship between the endocrine glands (glands of internal secretion) and human personality types. Berman examines how various glands—including the thyroid, pituitary, adrenals, gonads, and thymus—influence both physical characteristics and mental/personality traits. The work represents an early 20th century attempt to create a biological typology of human nature based on glandular function. The book covers the discovery of these glands, their physiological effects, their influence on sex differences, personality types, and speculates on applications to human evolution. While influential in its time, many of its conclusions would be considered outdated by modern endocrinology and psychology standards.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year 1922 is taken from the title page, which is the original publication date. This work was part of the early popularization of endocrinology in the 1920s, when understanding of hormones and glands was still developing. The book reflects the scientific optimism and biological determinism common in that era.

    <summarium>A Christian devotional and theological work that explores themes of resurrection, eternal life, and faith through a narrative framework. The book tells the story from the perspective of Quintus, a Roman knight who becomes involved in the events surrounding Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. Through chapters examining topics like &quot;Christ Himself the Witness to Immortality,&quot; &quot;Cicero or Christ?,&quot; and &quot;The Vision of the Risen Christ,&quot; Sanford uses this narrative device to explore early Christian apologetics and the contrast between classical Roman philosophy and Christian revelation. The work appears designed for Easter meditation and reflection on the meaning of Christ's resurrection.
</summarium>
    <notae>Published in 1922, this is an original work by Arthur Benton Sanford, not a translation or historical document from antiquity. While it uses a Roman character as a narrative device, it is a 20th-century American Christian devotional work. I did not tag this as 'catholic' because there is insufficient evidence that Sanford was a Catholic author or that this work would have received ecclesiastical approval, though it deals with Christian themes that would be acceptable to various Christian denominations.

    <summarium>A study examining conditions among women in India during the early 20th century, written from a Christian missionary perspective. The book focuses on education and evangelization efforts among Indian women, particularly highlighting the contrast between Western-educated Christian women and traditional Hindu society. It emphasizes the role of missionary work and women's education as vehicles for social reform in India, reflecting the colonial-era missionary movement's attitudes toward indigenous religious practices and the perceived need for Christian conversion.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year of 1922 is clearly stated on the title page. This work represents the perspective of American Christian missionary organizations during the colonial period in India. The book was published by the Central Committee (likely a missionary organization) and reflects the era's missionary attitudes, including significant cultural bias against Hinduism and other Indian religious traditions. This is a historical document that provides insight into early 20th-century American missionary perspectives on India, though it should be read with awareness of its colonial-era viewpoint and religious prejudices.

    <summarium>This is a study examining consumers' cooperative societies operating in New York State, published by the Consumers' League of New York in April 1922. The work was originally prepared by Cedric Long in 1921 and subsequently revised. The study outlines the fundamental principles of cooperative societies as established by the Rochdale Pioneers in England in 1844, which became the foundation for the modern cooperative movement. These principles include limiting capital stock earnings to legal interest rates, returning surplus earnings to members proportionally, and maintaining democratic one-member-one-vote governance. The document appears to be part of the early 20th century American cooperative movement, which sought to apply European cooperative principles to American economic conditions during a period of significant industrialization and labor organizing.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1922 is chosen as it represents the publication date of this revised edition. While the original study was prepared in 1921, the document explicitly states it was published in April 1922. This work is a primary source document from the American cooperative movement of the early 20th century rather than a historical work about earlier periods.

    <summarium>A novel by Edith Wharton published in 1922, set among the international social set of the post-World War I era. The story follows Nick Lansing and Susy Branch, two charming but impoverished members of high society who marry with a cynical pact: they will stay together only as long as it's convenient, and will divorce if either finds a wealthier match. The novel explores their honeymoon period as they live off the generosity of their wealthy friends, borrowing villas and estates across Europe. As their marriage of convenience evolves, the story examines themes of love versus material security, social climbing, and the moral compromises of their glittering but superficial world. The title refers to fleeting moments of genuine happiness and insight that break through their carefully constructed arrangement.
</summarium>
    <notae>This was published as a serial in 1922 before book publication the same year. It became one of Wharton's most popular novels and was adapted into a silent film in 1923. The novel represents Wharton's continued interest in examining the manners and morals of the wealthy leisure class, though set in the more modern post-WWI period rather than her earlier Gilded Age settings.

beginners and intermediate skiers, drawing on her extensive experience \
coaching novices. The book contains practical advice on skiing technique, \
with illustrations from photographs and a map. Writing from the perspective \
of someone who learned the sport later in life, Furse offers accessible \

    <summarium>Anthem is a dystopian novella by Ayn Rand, first published in 1938. It tells the story of a future dark age where individuality has been eliminated and humanity lives in a collectivist society where the word &quot;I&quot; has been abolished. The protagonist, Equality 7-2521, rediscovers individualism and the concept of self. The novella explores Rand's philosophy of individualism versus collectivism and is considered a precursor to her later, more developed philosophical novels. It's a short but powerful work that presents her early ideas about the importance of individual achievement and the dangers of totalitarian collectivism.
</summarium>
    <notae>Anthem was originally published in 1938 in England, and then in revised form in the United States in 1946. I've chosen 1938 as it represents the original publication date and the work's entry into literary history. The text notes that US copyright was not renewed, which is why it entered the public domain in the United States, though it remained under copyright in Canada at the time of this Gutenberg edition.

    <summarium>This volume is part of the Slave Narratives collection, a monumental historical project conducted by the Federal Writers' Project during the Great Depression (1936-1938). It contains first-person interviews with formerly enslaved people, preserving their oral histories and lived experiences of slavery in the United States. Volume VI specifically covers narratives from Kansas and includes interviews with Clayton Holbert, Bill Simms, and Belle Williams. These interviews represent invaluable primary source documents that provide direct testimony about the institution of slavery from those who experienced it, capturing details of daily life, family relationships, work conditions, and the transition to freedom. The collection was assembled by the Library of Congress and published in 1941.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1941 as the year because that is when this compilation was officially published and assembled as a historical document by the Library of Congress. While the interviews were conducted between 1936-1938, the published work as a complete archival collection dates to 1941. This is a historical document that records oral histories, so the 1941 publication date marks its creation as a historical artifact rather than the events it describes (which occurred in the 19th century). The work is not marked as 'appropriate-for-children' as it contains frank descriptions of slavery that may be disturbing. It is not tagged as 'catholic' as it is a secular government historical documentation project, though individual informants may have had various religious backgrounds.

    <summarium>This is a U.S. Copyright Office catalog documenting copyright renewal registrations made during 1957. It contains an alphabetical listing of books, pamphlets, serials, and periodical contributions that had their copyrights renewed during this period. Each entry includes information about both the original copyright registration (typically from the late 1920s or early 1930s, given the timing of the renewal period) and the renewal registration. This type of catalog served as an official public record of copyright renewals in the United States before the Copyright Act of 1976 changed renewal procedures. The document shows works by various authors including Jane Abbott and Pierre Abraham, among others, with original copyright dates around 1929-1930 being renewed in 1957 (consistent with the 28-year renewal period required under pre-1976 copyright law).
</summarium>
    <notae>Year 1957 chosen as this is clearly the year of publication for this catalog based on the renewal dates (R-numbers from 1957) throughout the document. While the works listed in the catalog are from earlier years (primarily 1929-1930), this is a 1957 government publication documenting those renewals. The Project Gutenberg ID 11816 is consistent with a mid-20th century government document that would have entered the public domain.

    <summarium>An instructional manual on squash tennis by Richard C. Squires, a nationally-ranked champion in multiple racquet sports. The book covers fundamental techniques, strategy, shot-making, court specifications, official rules, and the history of squash tennis. Squires was a multi-sport champion who won national titles in tennis, squash racquets, and squash tennis, making him uniquely qualified to write this guide. The manual appears designed as a practical introduction to the sport for players at various skill levels.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication date of March 1968 is stated in the text itself. This is a straightforward instructional sports manual rather than a literary or historical work. Not included 'appropriate-for-children' tag as it's a technical sports manual aimed at players of the sport, though it contains no inappropriate content.

    <summarium>This is a U.S. Copyright Office publication listing renewal registrations for books, pamphlets, serials, and periodical contributions during a specific period in 1971. These catalogs served as official records of copyright renewals, which were necessary under the copyright law in effect before 1978 to maintain copyright protection beyond the initial term.

    <summarium>This is a volume from the Catalog of Copyright Entries published by the United States Copyright Office. These catalogs serve as official records of copyright registrations and renewals in the United States. This particular section (from 1975) documents copyright renewals for books and pamphlets, listing bibliographic information about works whose copyrights were being renewed. The Copyright Office published these catalogs regularly to provide public notice of copyright claims. They are valuable historical documents for tracking the publication history of American works and understanding copyright practices in the 20th century.

    <summarium>'Civilization and Beyond' is Scott Nearing's ambitious analysis of the rise and fall of civilizations throughout history. Published when Nearing was 92 years old, the work examines various civilizations from Egypt to Rome to Western civilization, identifying common patterns in their life cycles. Nearing argues that civilization as a social form is becoming obsolete and proposes building blocks for a new world order beyond traditional civilization. The book reflects Nearing's lifetime of radical political thought, combining historical analysis with social critique and forward-looking proposals for social organization. Scott Nearing (1883-1983) was an American radical economist, educator, and advocate of simple living who became famous for his homesteading lifestyle and opposition to capitalism and war.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1975 is explicitly stated in the book itself as the publication date (August 1975, Social Science Institute, Harborside, Maine). This was one of Nearing's final major works, written near the end of his long life as a social critic and radical thinker. The book is deliberately placed in the public domain by the author, as indicated by the copyright notice.

    <summarium>'Joe Burke's Last Stand' is a contemporary work of fiction by American author John Moncure Wetterau, first published in 2000. Based on the copyright notice and Library of Congress registration, this appears to be a novel with the subtitle 'Every Story Is A Love Story', suggesting thematic elements around love and relationships. This is a modern work that was later made available through Project Gutenberg under a Creative Commons license. Little information is widely available about this particular work or author in historical literary records.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 2000 is chosen based on the explicit copyright notice '(c) 2000 by John Moncure Wetterau' in the text itself. The Library of Congress registration number (00-193498) also confirms this as a work registered in 2000. While the Project Gutenberg copyright notice shows 2003, this refers to the digitization date, not the original publication date of the work.

    <summarium>This is an audio recording by Roger McGuinn (founding member of The Byrds) performing the traditional American folk song &quot;Railroad Bill.&quot; The song tells the story of Railroad Bill, a legendary African American outlaw and folk hero from Alabama in the 1890s who evaded capture by hiding in railroad cars. McGuinn's version is part of his Folk Den project, where he recorded and shared traditional folk songs. This is a performance/interpretation of a traditional folk ballad rather than an original composition.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 2001 reflects when McGuinn created this recording for Project Gutenberg. However, &quot;Railroad Bill&quot; itself is a traditional folk song dating back to the 1890s, chronicling the real-life exploits of Morris Slater (Railroad Bill), who was killed in 1896. The song has been recorded by numerous artists throughout the 20th century. McGuinn's folk revival interpretation represents a modern performance of this historical American folk tradition.

    <notae>This is a contemporary work with a clear publication date of 2003. The copyright notice and Creative Commons licensing information make the dating straightforward.

    <summarium>This is an audio recording (MP3 format) of the traditional Christmas carol 'Away in a Manger' performed by Roger McGuinn and provided through his Folk Den project. The carol itself dates to the late 19th century, with music composed by James Murray in 1887 and the third verse written by John Thomas McFarland around 1904-1906. The first two verses are anonymous. McGuinn, best known as the founder of The Byrds, created the Folk Den as an online repository of traditional folk music performances.</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 2003 because this is specifically a copyrighted modern recording by Roger McGuinn, not a historical text. If you prefer to date this to the carol's composition (1887 for Murray's melody), that would also be defensible. The carol is Christian in nature but not specifically Catholic - it's a pan-Protestant/Christian carol.</notae>
