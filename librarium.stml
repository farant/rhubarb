    <summarium>The Memorabilia is one of the primary sources for understanding the historical Socrates, written by his student Xenophon. It consists of four books that record conversations and actions of Socrates, aiming to defend him against the charges that led to his execution and to portray him as a model of virtue and wisdom. Unlike Plato's more philosophical dialogues, Xenophon's account focuses on Socrates as a practical moral teacher concerned with everyday ethics and civic virtue. The work provides valuable insight into Socratic teaching methods and 4th century BCE Athenian society.
</summarium>
    <notae>Dating ancient works is complex. Xenophon lived 431-354 BCE. The Memorabilia was likely composed sometime between 385-375 BCE, after Socrates' death in 399 BCE and during Xenophon's exile. I've chosen approximately -371 BCE as a middle estimate for the composition date, representing when the work itself was written rather than the events it describes. The negative year notation follows historical convention (BCE). This translation by H.G. Dakyns was published by Macmillan in 1897.

    <summarium>This work contains selected discourses (lectures and conversations) of Epictetus along with the Encheiridion (meaning 'Manual' or 'Handbook'), which is a brief compendium of Stoic ethical advice. Epictetus (c. 50-135 AD) was a Greek Stoic philosopher who was born a slave in Hierapolis, Phrygia. He studied under Musonius Rufus and eventually gained his freedom. After being exiled from Rome by Emperor Domitian around 93 AD, he established a philosophical school in Nicopolis in northwestern Greece. Epictetus wrote nothing himself; his teachings were recorded by his student Arrian. The Discourses represent his philosophical teachings on ethics, logic, and how to live a good life according to Stoic principles, emphasizing what is within our control versus what is not. The Encheiridion is a shorter, more practical handbook derived from the Discourses. This translation by George Long (1800-1879) was one of the most popular English versions in the 19th century.
</summarium>
    <notae>Dating Epictetus' works is challenging since he wrote nothing himself. The Discourses and Encheiridion were compiled by his student Arrian sometime between 108-125 AD. I've chosen 108 AD as a reasonable middle estimate for when Arrian likely began compiling these teachings, though the actual lectures would have been delivered over many years. Some scholars prefer dating it closer to 125 AD. The philosophical content reflects teachings from Epictetus' school in Nicopolis after his exile from Rome (c. 93 AD). This particular translation by George Long was published in the 19th century.

    <summarium>Cassius Dio's Roman History is a monumental 80-book work covering Roman history from the legendary founding of Rome to 229 CE. Written in Greek during the reigns of Septimius Severus through Alexander Severus (roughly 211-229 CE), it is one of the most important surviving sources for Roman imperial history. This third volume (translated by Herbert Baldwin Foster in 1906) covers Books 45-51, spanning the critical period from 44 BCE to 29 BCE - including the aftermath of Julius Caesar's assassination, the formation and dissolution of the Second Triumvirate, the civil wars between Octavian and Mark Antony, and the Battle of Actium. Dio was a Roman senator and consul who had access to official records and wrote from an insider's perspective on Roman politics and governance.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose circa 220 CE as the year because this represents approximately when Dio was actively composing this work (he wrote over a period spanning roughly 200-220+ CE). The translated edition shown is from 1906, but since you asked for the year most historically accurate to the original work itself, the early 3rd century CE date is most appropriate. This is a primary historical source, not a later commentary or annotated edition.

    <summarium>Śakuntalā (also transliterated as Shakuntala) is the most famous Sanskrit drama by the ancient Indian poet Kālidāsa. It tells the story of Shakuntala, a forest-dwelling maiden who falls in love with King Dushyanta. After they marry in secret, the king returns to his kingdom promising to send for her. However, due to a curse, he forgets her entirely when she arrives at court. The &quot;lost ring&quot; of the title is the token of their marriage that eventually restores his memory. The play is considered one of the masterpieces of world literature and was instrumental in introducing Indian classical drama to the West. This translation by Sir Monier Monier-Williams was first published in 1855 and went through multiple editions, becoming one of the most influential English versions of the work.
</summarium>
    <notae>Kālidāsa's dates are uncertain, but scholarly consensus generally places him in the 4th-5th century CE (around 400 CE is a common estimate). The exact composition date of Śakuntalā is unknown, but this approximate date reflects when the work was likely written. This is significantly earlier than this particular translation (1855), but since the request is for when the work was originally authored rather than when this edition was published, I've chosen the historical composition date. The play has been translated numerous times since being introduced to Europe by Sir William Jones in 1789.

    <summarium>The Nibelungenlied is a Middle High German epic poem written around 1200 AD by an unknown author. It is one of the most important works of German medieval literature and tells the story of the dragon-slayer Siegfried, his marriage to Kriemhild, his murder by Hagen, and Kriemhild's revenge. The epic combines elements from Germanic heroic legend (particularly the Burgundian kings and Attila the Hun) with courtly medieval culture. It has been enormously influential in German culture and was a major source for Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle. The poem consists of 39 adventures (chapters) written in stanzas of four lines each. This translation by Daniel B. Shumway was published in 1909.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose circa 1200 AD as the year because this represents when the poem was originally composed in Middle High German, which is the most historically significant date for this work. While the exact date is uncertain (estimates range from approximately 1180-1210), around 1200 is the scholarly consensus. This is more meaningful than using 1909 (the publication year of this particular English translation). The work itself is the literary product of that medieval period and should be dated accordingly. The Nibelungenlied is not a work of fiction in the modern sense but rather a medieval epic that reworks older Germanic legends into the courtly culture of around 1200 AD, hence the 'historical-document' tag.

    <summarium>This is William Tyndale's pioneering English translation of the Pentateuch (first five books of the Old Testament) and the New Testament, translated directly from Hebrew and Greek sources rather than from the Latin Vulgate. Tyndale's work was revolutionary for making Scripture accessible to English-speaking common people and profoundly influenced all subsequent English Bible translations, including the King James Version. His translation work was considered heretical by Catholic authorities at the time, and Tyndale was eventually executed for his efforts in 1536. This particular edition modernizes the spelling while preserving Tyndale's original wording, with some variant readings noted from Coverdale (1535) and Matthew's Bible (1537).
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen as 1530 when Tyndale's Pentateuch was first published, representing the completion of his Old Testament work featured here. His New Testament was published earlier (1526).

    <summarium>The Discourses on Livy is Machiavelli's major work of republican political theory, written as a commentary on the first ten books of Livy's Roman history. Unlike 'The Prince' which focuses on autocratic rule, the Discourses examines republican government and civic virtue, using Roman history as a lens to analyze political liberty, military organization, and the role of conflict in healthy republics. Machiavelli argues that republics are superior to principalities and examines how Rome's political institutions, including the tension between patricians and plebeians, contributed to its success. This work profoundly influenced republican thought and constitutional theory in subsequent centuries.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1531 represents the first publication date (posthumous). The work was composed between approximately 1513-1517 but not published until after Machiavelli's death in 1527.

    <summarium>Troilus and Cressida is one of William Shakespeare's problem plays, set during the Trojan War. The play interweaves two storylines: the tragic love affair between the Trojan prince Troilus and Cressida, and the Greek siege of Troy, featuring famous warriors like Achilles, Ajax, and Hector. The work is notable for its cynical tone, questioning traditional heroic values and romantic ideals. It explores themes of honor, betrayal, time's destructive power, and the gap between reputation and reality. The play presents war as futile and love as unstable, making it one of Shakespeare's most philosophically complex and tonally ambiguous works.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact date of composition is debated, but most scholars place it between 1601-1603. The First Folio was published in 1623, but there was an earlier quarto edition in 1609. I've chosen 1602 as a reasonable middle estimate for when the play was likely written and first performed. This text appears to be from an early printing, likely the First Folio given the distinctive typography and spelling conventions (long 's', 'ſ' characters, etc.). The play was not categorized as 'appropriate-for-children' due to its mature themes and cynical treatment of love and war. It is not tagged as 'catholic' as Shakespeare's religious affiliations remain historically ambiguous and this work does not have explicitly Catholic themes.

    <summarium>Hamlet is one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies, telling the story of Prince Hamlet of Denmark who seeks to avenge his father's murder by his uncle Claudius, who has seized the throne and married Hamlet's mother. The play explores themes of revenge, madness, mortality, and moral corruption. It contains some of the most famous lines in English literature, including &quot;To be or not to be&quot; and features iconic scenes like the ghost of Hamlet's father and the play-within-a-play. This appears to be a First Folio or early quarto version, preserving the original printing conventions of Shakespeare's time.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1603 as this represents the approximate date of the Second Quarto, which is generally considered the most authoritative early text. The First Quarto dates to 1603, though Hamlet was likely first performed around 1600-1601. The First Folio was published in 1623. Given that this Gutenberg text preserves early printing conventions and spellings, 1603 captures the historical moment when this version of the text emerged. For a historical timeline, this date represents when English audiences first encountered this form of the play in print.

    <summarium>'The History of Tom Thumb' is one of the oldest English fairy tales, first published as a prose chapbook in 1621 under the title 'The History of Tom Thumbe.' The story features the legendary tiny hero Tom Thumb, supposedly born no bigger than his father's thumb through the intervention of Merlin the magician and the Queen of the Fairies during King Arthur's reign. This collection appears to be a late 19th or early 20th century republication by M.A. Donohue &amp; Co. (a Chicago publisher active from 1890s-1940s) that includes multiple traditional tales. Tom Thumb became an archetypal character in English folklore and has been retold countless times. The tale combines Arthurian legend with fairy tale elements and follows the adventures of the diminutive hero.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1621 as the year because this represents the first known printed publication of 'Tom Thumb' as a prose tale, which is the most historically significant date for this work in English literary history. While the oral tradition likely predates this, and this Gutenberg edition is clearly a much later (c. 1900-1920) illustrated children's edition by Donohue, the 1621 date best represents when this story entered the documented literary canon. The work is not attributed to a single author as it emerged from oral folklore tradition before being transcribed.

    <summarium>'The First Part of Henry the Sixth' (often written as 'Henry VI, Part 1') is a history play by William Shakespeare that dramatizes events during the early reign of King Henry VI of England and the early stages of the Hundred Years' War with France. The play focuses on the loss of English territories in France, the rivalry between the Duke of Gloucester and the Bishop of Winchester, and the rise of Joan of Arc (depicted as 'Joan la Pucelle'). It also introduces the conflict between the houses of York and Lancaster that would later erupt into the Wars of the Roses. The play is notable for its depiction of English military hero John Talbot and the political machinations at the English court. This appears to be from the First Folio edition based on the Executive Director's notes about original printing conventions.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1623 represents the First Folio publication, which is the first collected edition of Shakespeare's plays and the primary source text for Henry VI Part 1. While the play was likely written and performed in the early 1590s (possibly 1591-1592), the 1623 First Folio is the most historically significant edition as it's our earliest printed source. The Executive Director's notes about printing conventions (cliches, u/v substitutions, etc.) confirm this is reproduced from First Folio typography. The historical events depicted in the play occurred in the 1420s-1430s, but for a timeline of literary works, 1623 represents the definitive publication date.

    <summarium>'Clarissa' is Samuel Richardson's monumental epistolary novel, told entirely through letters between the characters. It chronicles the tragic story of Clarissa Harlowe, a virtuous young woman from a wealthy family who is pursued by the rake Robert Lovelace. The novel explores themes of virtue, sexuality, individual autonomy versus family authority, and the position of women in 18th-century society. After Clarissa refuses an arranged marriage and is subsequently abducted and violated by Lovelace, the narrative follows her moral and physical decline despite Lovelace's offers of marriage. The work is considered one of the most important novels in the English language and a foundational text of the novel form itself. Richardson, a printer by trade, created this work partly as a moral instruction, though its psychological complexity transcends simple didacticism.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was originally published in multiple installments between December 1747 and December 1748. I've chosen 1748 as it represents the completion of the first edition. Richardson later revised it substantially. While Richardson was Protestant (Anglican/Church of England), not Catholic, the novel does engage deeply with Christian themes of virtue, repentance, and redemption. It was widely read across denominational lines and influenced Catholic as well as Protestant moral literature. The work is decidedly not appropriate for children due to its subject matter involving abduction and sexual violation, even though these are handled with 18th-century discretion.

The renowned author of Tom Jones and Joseph Andrews documented his journey with characteristic wit, keen observation, and remarkable stoicism despite knowing his illness was likely fatal. Published posthumously in 1755, the work offers invaluable biographical insight into Fielding's character during his final months, revealing his affectionate concern for his family, his satirical yet kindly view of humanity, and his undiminished literary powers. It stands as both a touching human document and a fine example of 18th-century travel writing.

    <summarium>A traditional British or American sea shanty about whaling expeditions to Greenland waters. The song describes the harsh conditions faced by whalers sailing to the Arctic, including frozen extremities and dangerous work hunting Greenland whales (likely bowhead whales). Like many work songs of the era, it balances the hardship of the voyage with the promise of celebration and ale-drinking upon return to London. Sea shanties were functional work songs sung aboard ships to coordinate labor and maintain morale during long, difficult voyages.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1800 is an approximation representing the height of Greenland whaling activity. Traditional folk songs have no single composition date - they evolved through oral tradition. British Arctic whaling peaked roughly 1750-1850. This song reflects the actual historical practice of whaling expeditions departing in March (as mentioned in the lyrics) to reach Arctic waters during the brief summer season. Classified as non-fiction/historical-document because it represents authentic working life and culture of whalers, though it is a song rather than prose narrative.

    <summarium>This is the third of Beethoven's six String Quartets that comprise his Opus 18, which are considered his first mature works in the string quartet genre. These quartets were composed between 1798-1800 and published in 1801, representing Beethoven's early period when he was still heavily influenced by Haydn and Mozart, though his distinctive voice was beginning to emerge. The Opus 18 quartets established Beethoven as a significant composer in the quartet form, a genre he would revolutionize in his later works. This particular quartet (No. 3 in D major) is known for its lyrical character and demonstrates Beethoven's growing mastery of four-part writing and thematic development.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1801 represents the publication date of the Opus 18 quartets, which is the most historically significant date for these works. While composition occurred 1798-1800, the publication date is when these works became publicly available and established Beethoven's reputation in the quartet genre. This is a musical score, not a text work, so tags like 'appropriate-for-children' or 'fiction/non-fiction' in the traditional literary sense don't quite apply - I've categorized it as 'non-fiction' in the sense that musical scores are instructional/performance documents rather than narrative works.

    <summarium>Bagh O Bahar (Garden and Spring) is a classical Hindustani prose work that has been a standard text for learning the Hindustani language since the early 19th century. Originally commissioned by Fort William College in Calcutta, Mir Amman adapted this work from earlier Persian tales, particularly the Qissa-e Chahar Darvesh. The work consists of romantic tales featuring four dervishes (wandering Muslim holy men) and displays Eastern manners, modes of thinking, and various idioms of the Hindustani language. The tales incorporate elements common to Oriental romance: jinn, demons, fairies, angels, and fabulous machinery that reflect Islamic beliefs and imagination. While primarily valued as a linguistic and cultural text, it contains entertaining narratives that illustrate the storytelling traditions of Mughal India.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1802 represents when Mir Amman completed this Hindustani version at Fort William College. This translation by Duncan Forbes is from 1874, but the historically significant date is Mir Amman's original composition. The work draws on much older Persian sources, but Mir Amman's Hindustani rendering is what became the celebrated classical text throughout British India. This text has been used for over 150 years as an introduction to Hindustani language and culture.

    <summarium>Adolphe Thiers' 'Histoire de la Révolution française' is one of the most important and influential historical accounts of the French Revolution, written in the early 19th century. Originally published in ten volumes between 1823 and 1827, this work shaped historical understanding of the Revolution for generations. Volume III covers the period of the Convention Nationale beginning in September 1792, including the September Massacres, the trial and execution of Louis XVI, the establishment of the Republic, and the conflicts between the Girondins and Montagnards. Thiers, who would later become Prime Minister and President of France, wrote this as a young man and it established his reputation as both a historian and political thinker. The work is notable for its detailed narrative style and its attempt to provide a comprehensive account of the Revolution's political and social upheavals.
</summarium>
    <notae>The first volumes of Thiers' work began appearing in 1823, with the complete ten-volume set finished by 1827. Volume III would have been published around 1823-1824. This is not merely a translation but an original French historical work. Thiers was not Catholic and the work takes a liberal-constitutional perspective on the Revolution, so it does not receive a 'catholic' tag.

    <summarium>This is Adolphe Thiers' monumental multi-volume history of the French Revolution, one of the most influential historical works of the 19th century. This particular volume (Tome IX) covers the Directory period (Directoire) in the winter of Year V (1797), including the political situation, the characters and divisions among the five Directors (Barras, Carnot, Rewbell, Letourneur, and Larévellière-Lépaux), public opinion, royalist intrigues, and the military situation following victories at Rivoli and the capture of Mantua. Thiers' work was groundbreaking for its use of primary sources and its relatively sympathetic treatment of the revolutionary period. It established him as a major historian and political figure in France.
</summarium>
    <notae>The work was originally published between 1823-1827 in ten volumes. This appears to be from the ninth edition (neuvième édition), indicating its popularity and continued republication throughout the 19th century. I've chosen 1823 as the year since this represents the original publication date of this historical work, which is most appropriate for a historical timeline. While Thiers was raised Catholic, this is a secular historical work and would not be considered for nihil obstat/imprimatur, so I have not included the 'catholic' tag.

    <summarium>'O, Tannenbaum' (O Christmas Tree) is a traditional German Christmas carol. The melody is believed to have originated earlier, but the most well-known lyrics about the fir tree were written by Ernst Anschütz, a Leipzig teacher and organist, in 1824. The song celebrates the evergreen fir tree as a symbol of constancy and faithfulness. This Project Gutenberg entry is an audio recording performed by the Nebe Quartett, taken from the Edison National Historic Site, representing an early phonograph recording of this beloved carol.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1824 as the year because that's when Ernst Anschütz wrote the familiar lyrics we associate with 'O, Tannenbaum' today. While the melody existed earlier (possibly from a 16th-century Silesian folk song), and the song has evolved through various versions, 1824 represents the creation of the version that became the standard. This Gutenberg entry is actually an audio recording (mp3 format) rather than a text, which is unusual - it's a historical phonograph recording from the Edison collection, but for timeline purposes the composition date is most historically meaningful. Not marked as Catholic despite being a Christmas carol since it's a secular song about a Christmas tree rather than a liturgical or devotional work.

    <summarium>This is the tenth volume of Samuel Johnson's collected works, published in 1825. It contains Johnson's famous Parliamentary Debates, which he originally wrote for The Gentleman's Magazine between 1741-1744 under the fictional pretense of reporting debates from the &quot;Senate of Magna Lilliput&quot; (to avoid legal restrictions on reporting actual parliamentary proceedings). These debates cover important political matters of the early 1740s including military affairs, the War of Austrian Succession, and attempts to remove Prime Minister Robert Walpole. Johnson's parliamentary debates are considered significant works of 18th-century political prose, though they are literary recreations rather than verbatim transcripts. Johnson himself later acknowledged he &quot;took care that the Whig dogs should not have the best of it.&quot;
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1825 refers to this collected edition. The actual parliamentary debates contained within were originally written by Johnson between 1741-1744. I chose 1825 as it represents this specific published volume, though the content dates from the 1740s. Johnson was Anglican, not Catholic, so this does not receive a 'catholic' tag.

    <summarium>'The Spirit of the Age' is a collection of critical essays by William Hazlitt, one of the greatest English essayists and critics of the Romantic period. Published in 1825, the work contains character sketches and literary portraits of prominent intellectual figures of early 19th-century England. The essays examine philosophers, poets, writers, and thinkers including Jeremy Bentham, William Godwin, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, William Wordsworth, Walter Scott, and Thomas Malthus, among others. Hazlitt's penetrating observations combine biographical details with critical assessments of their work and influence on contemporary thought. The book is considered a masterpiece of biographical criticism and provides invaluable insight into the intellectual climate of the Romantic era.
</summarium>
    <notae>Published in 1825. This is Hazlitt's original publication date. While Hazlitt was not Catholic (he was raised as a Unitarian and became more secular), this work represents an important document of English literary criticism and would be suitable for general audiences interested in history and literature.

    <summarium>This is a collection of poems by Thomas Gent, a relatively obscure English poet 
of the early 19th century. The volume includes both previously published pieces 
that had been well-received individually, as well as many poems being printed 
for the first time. Gent describes himself as someone whose financial circumstances 
prevented him from devoting himself fully to poetry, making it merely 'the amusements 
of the leisure hours' rather than a full-time pursuit. The Advertisement reveals 
a touching personal note - during the printing of this collection, Gent suffered 
a severe domestic loss (likely the death of his wife), which he mentions with 
considerable emotion at the end of his preface.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1828 is clearly indicated as the publication date in London. This is an 
original work from that period, not a translation or reprint of earlier material. 
Thomas Gent was not a major literary figure, and little is known about him today. 
The work is not Catholic in nature - it appears to be secular English poetry from 
the Romantic era. The tag 'not-appropriate-for-children' is applied as a default 
for general poetry collections of this period, though the actual content may vary.

    <summarium>'The Teacher' is one of Jacob Abbott's most influential educational works, presenting a systematic approach to classroom management and instruction based on moral influence rather than harsh discipline. Abbott (1803-1879) was a pioneering American educator, Congregationalist minister, and prolific author who founded the Mount Vernon School for Young Ladies in Boston. This book became a foundational text in teacher training and represented a progressive shift toward understanding child psychology and employing gentler, more rational methods of instruction. Abbott advocated for treating students with respect, appealing to their reason and conscience, and creating an organized system of school management. His educational philosophy influenced American pedagogy throughout the 19th century and helped professionalize the teaching occupation. Abbott is also famous for writing the Rollo books, a popular series of children's literature.

    <notae>The text shows this is a revised edition from 1873 (as stated on the title page), but the work was originally published in 1833.

    <summarium>This is one of the most influential American child-rearing manuals of the 19th century, written by physician and reformer William Andrus Alcott. The work provides practical advice on managing children's health, covering topics from nursery arrangement and temperature control to ventilation, clothing, diet, and general childcare practices. Alcott was part of the health reform movement of his era and advocated for rational, scientific approaches to child-rearing rather than traditional folk practices. This third edition (1836) was enlarged with additional sections including guidance for mothers' own health and conduct. The book reflects the emerging professionalization of medicine and domestic science in antebellum America and was widely read by middle-class families seeking modern, enlightened approaches to child-rearing.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1836 represents this specific third edition as stated in the advertisement. Earlier editions would have been published slightly before this. Alcott was a prolific writer on health reform topics and cousin to Louisa May Alcott's father, Amos Bronson Alcott. While Alcott may have had Protestant religious influences, this work is primarily a secular health manual and does not qualify for the 'catholic' tag based on the criteria provided.

Rovani was a prominent 19th-century Milanese novelist and art critic known for his historical fiction that combined romantic storytelling with detailed historical research about Renaissance and early modern Italy.

    <summarium>The Moorland Cottage is a novella by Elizabeth Gaskell, first published in December 1850. It tells the story of Mrs. Browne, a widow living in a secluded cottage on the moorlands with her two children, Maggie and Edward, and their faithful servant Nancy. The tale explores themes of maternal favoritism, moral education, and the consequences of character formation. Mrs. Browne unwisely favors her son Edward over her daughter Maggie, leading to Edward's moral weakness and Maggie's quiet strength. The story is set in rural England and is characteristic of Gaskell's attention to domestic life and moral development. It's a shorter work compared to her major novels like Mary Barton or North and South, but demonstrates her skill in portraying family dynamics and social commentary within a compact narrative.
</summarium>
    <notae>The text states &quot;NEW YORK: 1851&quot; but this appears to be an American reprint. The work was first published in England in December 1850, so I've used 1850 as the original publication year, which is more historically accurate for timeline purposes. Elizabeth Gaskell was a Unitarian rather than Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag is not applicable despite her deeply moral and Christian themes.

    <summarium>'The Wisdom of Life' (Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit) is one of Arthur Schopenhauer's \
most accessible philosophical essays, part of his 'Parerga and Paralipomena' (1851). \
In this work, Schopenhauer presents practical philosophy on how to achieve eudaimonia \
(happiness/flourishing) through understanding what truly contributes to human happiness. \
He divides human existence into three fundamental categories: what one is (personality), \
what one has (property), and what one represents (reputation/position). Despite his \
famous pessimism about existence, this essay offers practical wisdom for living well. \
Schopenhauer was heavily influenced by Kant, Plato, and Eastern philosophy, particularly \
Buddhism and Hinduism, though his philosophy is fundamentally atheistic and incompatible \
with Catholic teaching.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1851 as the year because that's when the original German work 'Parerga und \
Paralipomena' was published, which contains this essay. The T. Bailey Saunders English \
translation came later (1890s), but for historical timeline purposes, the original \
composition date is most educationally accurate. Note: Schopenhauer was baptized Lutheran \
but was an explicit atheist and pessimist who rejected Christian metaphysics, so this \
does not receive a 'catholic' tag despite its philosophical merit.

    <summarium>'Counsels and Maxims' (German: 'Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit') is part of Arthur Schopenhauer's 'Parerga and Paralipomena' (1851), a collection of philosophical essays. This particular section offers practical wisdom and guidance for living, covering topics like our relation to ourselves and others, worldly fortune, and the ages of life. Schopenhauer, known for his pessimistic philosophy influenced by Eastern thought and Kant, here presents accessible ethical reflections and life advice. The work is more practical than his metaphysical writings like 'The World as Will and Representation'. This English translation by T. Bailey Saunders made Schopenhauer's thought widely accessible to English readers in the late Victorian era.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1851 represents the original German publication date of 'Parerga and Paralipomena'. T. Bailey Saunders' English translation was published later (around 1890-1893), but since this is Schopenhauer's original work rather than a substantially modified edition, the original publication date is most historically accurate for timeline purposes.

    <summarium>This is the tenth book in 'The Good Child's Library' series, a collection of religious educational materials designed for children in the mid-19th century. The work presents the parables of Jesus Christ in verse form, making them more accessible and memorable for young readers. The book was published with elaborate color illustrations (using an oil color printing process that was innovative for its time) depicting biblical scenes. The series aimed to encourage Scripture reading among children by presenting New Testament narratives in an attractive, engaging format while maintaining doctrinal soundness suitable for Catholic instruction.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1851 is taken directly from the title page of this edition. This appears to be an American Catholic publication, as indicated by the publisher's claim to originating the oil color printing process &quot;in this country&quot; and the explicitly Catholic educational aims (references to making the Bible accessible while maintaining proper religious formation). The work is clearly intended to have ecclesiastical approval, given its educational purpose and the era's publishing standards for Catholic children's materials.

    <summarium>'The Evil Guest' is a gothic mystery novel by Irish author J. Sheridan Le Fanu, first serialized in the Dublin University Magazine in 1851. The story is set in England about sixty years before its publication (circa 1790s) and centers on the Marston family at their decaying estate called Gray Forest. The novel follows the Hon. Richard Marston, his wife, and their two children as they become entangled with a mysterious and sinister guest. Le Fanu was a master of gothic fiction and psychological suspense, and this early work displays his talent for creating atmosphere and dread. The novel explores themes of lust, sin, and death, as indicated by its biblical epigraph.
</summarium>
    <notae>The text displays '1895' which likely refers to a posthumous edition. Le Fanu died in 1873, so this would be a later reprint. The original publication was in 1851 as a serial, making it one of Le Fanu's earlier works. I chose 1851 as the year because it represents the work's original appearance and historical significance. The story itself is set &quot;about sixty years ago&quot; from the 1851 publication, placing the narrative around the 1790s.

    <summarium>Bleak House is one of Charles Dickens' major novels, published in serial form between 1852-1853. It is a complex social novel that satirizes the British judicial system, particularly the Court of Chancery, through the protracted case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The novel follows multiple interconnected storylines, including the young Esther Summerson's narrative, Lady Dedlock's mysterious past, and a large cast of memorable characters from various social classes. The novel is notable for its innovative dual narrative structure (third-person omniscient alternating with Esther's first-person account), its criticism of institutional incompetence and bureaucratic delays, its vivid portrayal of Victorian London including the slums of Tom-all-Alone's, and its detective plot elements involving Inspector Bucket. Dickens uses the interminable Chancery case as a metaphor for systemic dysfunction that destroys lives and drains resources. The novel is considered one of his finest achievements and a masterpiece of Victorian literature.
</summarium>
    <notae>Published in monthly installments from March 1852 to September 1853, then in book form in 1853. I've used 1853 as the canonical publication year since that's when the complete novel appeared in book form and is the date most commonly associated with the work historically.

    <summarium>A novella by Herman Melville about a Wall Street lawyer who hires a peculiar scrivener (law-copyist) named Bartleby. The story explores themes of alienation, passive resistance, and the dehumanizing effects of modern work through Bartleby's increasingly withdrawn behavior and his haunting refrain 'I would prefer not to.' It's considered one of the earliest and most influential works examining workplace alienation and existential malaise in American literature. The story has become iconic for its exploration of individual agency versus social obligation.</summarium>

    <summarium>'The Star-Chamber' is a historical romance by William Harrison Ainsworth set in early 17th-century England during the reign of King James I. The novel deals with the notorious Court of Star Chamber, a royal court that became infamous for its arbitrary and oppressive proceedings. The story involves Sir Giles Mompesson, a historical figure who was a corrupt courtier and patent monopolist, and features other historical figures including the Marquis of Buckingham, Prince Charles (later Charles I), and the Conde de Gondomar (Spanish ambassador). Ainsworth was known for his vivid historical romances that popularized English history through melodramatic narratives, and this work exemplifies his style of blending historical fact with romantic fiction.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1854. This appears to be the Tauchnitz Continental edition from the same year. Ainsworth was a Protestant English author writing popular historical fiction, not a Catholic author, so the 'catholic' tag does not apply despite the historical setting that would have included Catholic characters.

    <summarium>This is Austin Steward's slave narrative, published in 1857 (though dated 1856 in some editions). Steward was enslaved for twenty-two years before gaining his freedom and becoming a prominent abolitionist and community leader. The work documents his experiences under slavery and his subsequent forty years of freedom, including his time as president of the Wilberforce Colony in London, Canada West (Ontario), one of the settlements established for formerly enslaved people who escaped to Canada. The narrative includes correspondence from his time leading this colony. Slave narratives like this were crucial primary sources documenting the horrors of slavery and were important tools in the abolitionist movement. Steward's account is particularly notable for its documentation of both the Southern slave experience and the post-emancipation challenges of building free Black communities in Canada.
</summarium>
    <notae>The work was published in Rochester in 1856/1857 (there's some ambiguity in dating - the title page says 1856, but it was published in September 1856 and often cataloged as 1857). I've chosen 1857 as it appears to be the more common scholarly dating. The letter from Governor Myron H. Clark of New York dated May 10, 1856 shows Steward was soliciting subscribers before publication. This is a historically significant primary source document from the antebellum period.

    <summarium>&quot;Natalie; or, A Gem Among the Sea-Weeds&quot; is a mid-19th century American sentimental novel by Ferna Vale. Published in 1859, it exemplifies the domestic fiction popular during that era, focusing on moral and spiritual themes. The preface indicates the work has Christian undertones, encouraging readers to take up their cross with &quot;meekness and humility&quot; and find the path home to spiritual redemption. The novel is set against a coastal backdrop, as suggested by the chapter epigraph about &quot;childhood's home&quot; by the &quot;wave-lashed shore.&quot; Like much sentimental fiction of the period, it likely follows its protagonist Natalie through moral trials and spiritual growth. Ferna Vale was a pseudonymous American author of the antebellum period who wrote primarily moralistic fiction for young readers and women.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1859 is taken directly from the title page. This places the work in the final years before the American Civil War, during the height of sentimental domestic fiction's popularity in America. The dedication to &quot;my darling Hattie&quot; and the author's hope for &quot;a purer gem&quot; suggests the intimate, morally instructive tone characteristic of the genre.

    <summarium>The Atlantic Monthly (later The Atlantic) was founded in 1857 in Boston as a literary and cultural magazine. This particular issue appears to be from around 1859-1860 based on the table of contents, which includes serialized fiction like Harriet Beecher Stowe's &quot;The Minister's Wooing&quot; (which ran in the magazine from December 1858 to December 1859). The magazine featured essays, poetry, fiction, and commentary on politics and culture, and became one of America's most prestigious literary journals. Contributors in its early years included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., and Harriet Beecher Stowe among other prominent American writers.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1860 is chosen as a best estimate based on &quot;The Minister's Wooing&quot; appearing in the contents, which was serialized 1858-1859, suggesting this is likely an 1859 or early 1860 issue. Without more specific information about which volume/issue this represents, 1860 serves as a representative year for this early period of the magazine. This is not appropriate for children as it's a sophisticated literary magazine aimed at adult readers.

    <summarium>&quot;The Dog Crusoe and His Master&quot; is an adventure novel by Scottish author R.M. Ballantyne, set in the Western Prairies of North America. The story follows a young frontiersman and his faithful dog Crusoe through various adventures in the American wilderness. Ballantyne was known for his juvenile adventure fiction, and this work exemplifies his style of exciting, morally upright tales suitable for young readers. The novel combines themes of friendship, loyalty, courage, and survival in the untamed frontier, typical of Ballantyne's works which often drew on real settings and experiences to create engaging stories for Victorian youth.
</summarium>
    <notae>The original publication date was 1861. The 1894 date shown in this Gutenberg text appears to be a later edition. Ballantyne wrote this novel based on his own experiences and observations of frontier life, though he took considerable literary license.

The work particularly focuses on how different Breton departments (Finistère, Ille-et-Vilaine, Côtes-du-Nord, Morbihan) were experiencing varying degrees of modernization, with Finistère being the most traditional.

    <summarium>Utilitarianism is one of the most influential works in moral philosophy, written by John Stuart Mill. The book presents and defends the utilitarian ethical theory, which holds that actions are right insofar as they promote happiness and wrong insofar as they produce unhappiness. Mill refines earlier utilitarian thought (particularly from Jeremy Bentham) by introducing qualitative distinctions between pleasures and arguing that some pleasures are inherently more valuable than others. The work addresses major objections to utilitarianism and explores the connection between utility and justice. It remains a foundational text in consequentialist ethics and continues to influence moral and political philosophy.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in Fraser's Magazine in 1861 as a series of three articles. The first book edition appeared in 1863. I've chosen 1861 as the historically significant date when the work first appeared in print. This 1879 edition is the seventh edition published by Longmans, Green, and Co.

Julia Ward Howe wrote the lyrics in November 1861 after visiting a Union Army camp near Washington, D.C.

The hymn became an anthem for the Union cause during the Civil War and has remained a significant piece of American cultural and religious heritage, often performed at patriotic ceremonies and in church settings. The lyrics invoke biblical imagery and Christian themes of righteousness and divine justice, framing the Union cause in apocalyptic terms.

    <summarium>Charles Kingsley (1819-1875) was an English clergyman, novelist, and social reformer associated with Christian Socialism and the Broad Church movement within Anglicanism. 'The Gospel of the Pentateuch' is a collection of parish sermons exploring Christian theological themes found in the first five books of the Hebrew Bible (Torah). Kingsley was known for his muscular Christianity philosophy and efforts to make Christianity socially relevant. The work is dedicated to Canon Stanley, whose writings on the Jewish Church influenced Kingsley's approach. As a collection of sermons, it represents Victorian Anglican homiletics and biblical interpretation, seeking to draw out the evangelical message (gospel) from Old Testament narratives.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year isn't stated in the excerpt, but Charles Kingsley's sermons were typically published in the 1860s. Based on historical records, 'The Gospel of the Pentateuch' was first published around 1863. While Kingsley was a clergyman in the Church of England (Anglican), this work would not receive a Catholic imprimatur as Anglicanism separated from Rome in the 16th century.

This series follows the adventures of Frank Nelson, a young naturalist, through various Civil War-era adventures including naval service on Union gunboats and outdoor expeditions. The series was enormously popular with young readers and helped establish the genre of American boys' adventure fiction.

    <summarium>A practical manual on mule breeding, training, and management written by Harvey Riley, who served as Superintendent of the Government Corral in Washington D.C. during the Civil War era. Drawing on thirty years of experience, Riley advocates strongly for humane treatment of mules and argues that the government could save significant resources by requiring proper training for teamsters and wagon-masters. The work reflects the crucial role mules played in 19th century American agriculture, transportation, and military logistics, while also serving as an early advocacy piece for animal welfare. Riley's perspective combines practical expertise with a reform-minded approach to improving working conditions for these essential draft animals.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1867 is unambiguous - it appears both on the title page and in the dated preface (April 12, 1867). This work was published shortly after the American Civil War, during which mules played an essential role in military logistics. The author's position as Superintendent of the Government Corral and his advocacy for government reform in animal management reflects the massive scale of animal use (and loss) during the war years.

    <summarium>'Our Churches and Chapels' is a Victorian-era work of local history and religious sociology by Anthony Hewitson (writing as 'Atticus'), a journalist for the Preston Chronicle. The book provides a critical and historical survey of every place of worship in Preston, Lancashire, England, including descriptions of the buildings, clergy, and congregations. Originally serialized in the Preston Chronicle newspaper, it offers a snapshot of religious life in an English industrial town during the Victorian period, with commentary on various denominations including Anglican, Catholic, and Nonconformist chapels. The work is notable for its journalistic style and sometimes satirical observations of local religious institutions and their leaders.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1869 represents the approximate first book publication, though the articles originally appeared serialized in the Preston Chronicle newspaper slightly earlier. This is a work of local history and religious commentary rather than theology, written from a journalistic perspective about a specific English town's religious landscape during the Victorian era.

    <summarium>'Minnie's Sacrifice' is a serialized novel by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, one of the most prominent African-American writers and activists of the 19th century. The novel tells the story of the tragic consequences of slavery, focusing on themes of racial identity, motherhood, and the destruction of families under the institution of slavery. It follows characters affected by slavery's brutal realities, including sexual exploitation and the separation of families. Harper was a pioneering voice in African-American literature, and this work reflects her deep commitment to abolition and civil rights. The novel was originally serialized in the Christian Recorder and was considered lost for many years before being rediscovered and republished in the late 20th century.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1869 reflects when this novel was originally serialized in the Christian Recorder, a weekly publication of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This was during the Reconstruction era, just after the Civil War. While Harper lived from 1825-1911 and published works over six decades, this particular novel comes from her immediate post-Civil War period when she was actively writing about the legacy of slavery and the challenges facing newly freed African Americans. The novel was considered lost literature until Frances Smith Foster rediscovered and edited it for modern publication.

    <summarium>Frances Ridley Havergal (1836-1879) was a devout English hymn writer and religious poet, known for her deep evangelical piety and consecration literature. 'Coming to the King' is a devotional work exploring themes of Christian commitment, surrender to Christ, and intimate relationship with God. Havergal was particularly known for her hymns including 'Take My Life and Let It Be' and 'Like a River Glorious.' Her writings emphasize total consecration to Christ and living in His presence. Though Anglican, her deeply spiritual and orthodox Christian writings focusing on devotion to Christ and scriptural meditation align with traditional catholic (universal Christian) spirituality and would likely be viewed favorably from a Catholic perspective due to their christocentric focus and orthodox theology.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year is estimated as circa 1870s during Havergal's most productive writing period. Her major devotional works were published between 1870-1879. Given the Project Gutenberg release suggests this was a well-established work by 2004, and Havergal's career peak was in the 1870s, I've chosen 1870 as a reasonable approximate date. If more precise bibliographic information were available, this could be refined. The work represents Victorian evangelical devotional literature at its height.

    <summarium>&quot;Seitsemän veljestä&quot; (Seven Brothers) is considered the first significant novel in Finnish literature and one of the most important works in the Finnish language. Written by Aleksis Kivi, it tells the story of seven brothers - Juhani, Tuomas, Aapo, Simeoni, Timo, Lauri, and Eero - who live on the Jukola farm in southern Häme. The novel chronicles their wild, often comedic adventures as they resist civilization (particularly learning to read, attending church, and following social norms) and eventually mature into responsible citizens. The work is both a coming-of-age story and a vivid portrayal of rural Finnish life in the 19th century. It has been enormously influential in Finnish culture and is still widely read today.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1870 as the primary year since this was when the work was first published, even though it appeared in installments. The 1873 date represents the first single-volume edition, and 1890 is this particular edition.

    <summarium>François Guizot's comprehensive six-volume History of France is a monumental work of 19th-century historiography. Written by one of France's leading historians and statesmen, this work traces French history from its earliest origins through the medieval period and beyond. Guizot's approach was notable for his emphasis on the development of civilization and institutions, rather than mere chronological recitation of events. In the introduction, Guizot articulates his philosophy of history as containing both &quot;fated causes&quot; (general laws and trends) and &quot;unrestricted causes&quot; (human free will and agency). The work was originally conceived as stories told to his grandchildren, giving it an accessible narrative quality while maintaining scholarly rigor.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact year of publication is somewhat ambiguous as the multi-volume French original was published over several years in the early 1870s. I've chosen 1872 as a representative date for the beginning of this major work's publication. Guizot was a Protestant, not Catholic, so despite the historical and scholarly nature of this work, it would not carry Catholic ecclesiastical approval.

Topics include critiques of harsh parenting practices (corporal punishment, breaking children's wills), the importance of courtesy within families, children's education and social development, and various domestic concerns.

    <summarium>'The City of Dreadful Night' is a long Victorian poem by James Thomson (writing as B.V., for Bysshe Vanolis), first published serially in the National Reformer in 1874. The poem is considered one of the most powerful expressions of philosophical pessimism and religious doubt in Victorian literature. It depicts a nightmarish, allegorical city where the inhabitants wander in despair, having lost all hope of divine salvation or transcendent meaning. The work is influenced by Dante's Inferno (hence the epigraph 'Per me si va nella citta dolente' - 'Through me you enter the sorrowful city') and by Leopardi's philosophical pessimism. Thomson's dark vision reflects his own struggles with alcoholism, depression, and loss of faith. The poem is a cornerstone of Victorian atheistic and nihilistic literature, expressing profound alienation and existential despair.
</summarium>
    <notae>The poem was first published in serial form in the National Reformer magazine from March to May 1874, and this is the date most commonly associated with the work. It was later published in book form in 1880. Thomson (1834-1882) was a Scottish poet who adopted the pen name B.V. in honor of Shelley (Bysshe) and Novalis. The work stands in stark contrast to Catholic literature and represents Victorian crisis of faith.

    <summarium>&quot;Fated to Be Free&quot; is a Victorian novel by English poet and novelist Jean Ingelow, first published in 1875. The work is connected to another of her stories, &quot;Off the Skelligs.&quot; In her preface to the American edition, Ingelow explains that she deliberately avoided creating a conventional &quot;work of art&quot; and instead attempted to produce &quot;a piece of nature&quot; - a chronicle that would give readers a sense of reality rather than a carefully crafted artistic story. The novel is notable for its unconventional approach: it features a remarkable child who grows into a commonplace man, includes many children throughout (unlike most adult fiction), and focuses on older, more mature characters as the most important and interesting figures, rather than following the Victorian convention of young heroes and heroines. Ingelow was a popular Victorian author known for her poetry and children's literature, including &quot;Mopsa the Fairy.&quot;
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1875 is printed directly on the title page. This appears to be the original publication date for this novel. Jean Ingelow (1820-1897) was a respected Victorian writer, though not Catholic, so the 'catholic' tag was not included.

Malot was a prolific 19th-century French novelist who wrote extensively about social issues and the struggles of ordinary people in French society. This work appears to deal with the world of inventors and patents, exploring the commercial exploitation and difficulties faced by inventors in Paris.

    <summarium>'The House That Jack Built' is a traditional English nursery rhyme and cumulative tale, part of the Mother Goose collection. This particular edition is one of Randolph Caldecott's famous Picture Books, published in 1878. The rhyme builds upon itself in a repetitive pattern, introducing a chain of characters and events connected to a house that Jack built. Caldecott's illustrations transformed the simple nursery rhyme into a beloved illustrated work that significantly influenced children's book illustration. His lively, humorous drawings brought new life to traditional rhymes and earned him lasting recognition in children's literature.

The rhyme itself dates back to at least the 16th century and possibly earlier, with various origins proposed (some suggest it may derive from an Aramaic chant or have connections to historical events). However, the 1878 Caldecott edition is a significant publication in its own right and represents when this particular version entered the world.

    <notae>The novel was first published in 1879 (serialized 1878-1879). This is a straightforward single-author work without substantial commentary, so the original publication year is used.

    <summarium>&quot;Half a Century&quot; is the autobiography of Jane Grey Swisshelm (1815-1884), a pioneering American journalist, abolitionist, and women's rights advocate. Published in 1880, this memoir chronicles her experiences in the anti-slavery movement and the Civil War era. Swisshelm was notable as one of the first female newspaper editors and political reporters in the United States. The work provides firsthand accounts of the abolition struggle, hospital conditions during the Civil War, and the social and political battles of mid-19th century America.

Swisshelm was a complex figure who doesn't fit neatly into modern categories - she was progressive on abolition and women's rights but held other views typical of her era. The work is not classified as 'catholic' despite her Christian framework, as she was Protestant (Presbyterian/Methodist background) and the work doesn't reflect specifically Catholic authorship or perspective.

    <summarium>This is the second volume of A.H. Bullen's four-volume scholarly edition of previously unpublished English Renaissance plays. The volume contains four plays: 'Dick of Devonshire' (possibly by Thomas Heywood), 'The Lady Mother' (by Henry Glapthorne), 'The Tragedy of Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt' (by John Fletcher and Philip Massinger), and 'Captain Underwit' (by James Shirley). Bullen transcribed these plays from manuscripts, including the Egerton MS. 1,994. This collection is significant for making these 17th-century dramatic works accessible to scholars and represents important work in English Renaissance literary scholarship.
</summarium>
    <notae>The date 1882 represents the beginning of the publication period (1882-89) for the four-volume series. This is an editorial/scholarly work rather than original creative work, containing plays originally written in the 17th century but published here for the first time from manuscript sources.

    <summarium>This is a collection of short stories by Louisa M. Alcott, author of the beloved &quot;Little Women&quot; series. Originally published under the title &quot;Proverb Stories&quot; in 1882, this collection includes five tales: &quot;Kitty's Class Day,&quot; &quot;Aunt Kipp,&quot; &quot;Psyche's Art,&quot; &quot;A Country Christmas,&quot; and &quot;On Picket Duty.&quot; The preface reveals Alcott's characteristic self-deprecating humor as she describes collecting these &quot;waifs and strays&quot; while forbidden to write new material due to health concerns. She also includes &quot;The Baron's Gloves&quot; (though not listed in this table of contents excerpt) as an example of the &quot;romantic rubbish&quot; she wrote early in her career, offering it as a cautionary example to aspiring young writers. The collection showcases Alcott's range as a storyteller while maintaining her accessible, moralistic style that made her popular with young readers.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1882 is clearly stated as the original publication date in the excerpt. Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) was at the height of her fame during this period, having published &quot;Little Women&quot; in 1868. The preface's mention of being &quot;forbidden to write&quot; reflects Alcott's ongoing health struggles in her later years. While Alcott herself was raised in a transcendentalist household and her personal religious views were complex, her work generally promoted moral values consistent with mainstream Protestant American culture of her time, though she was not Catholic.

    <summarium>&quot;Mr. Scarborough's Family&quot; is one of Anthony Trollope's later novels, published posthumously in 1883. The novel centers on the eccentric Mr. Scarborough, who shocks society by declaring that his eldest son Mountjoy is illegitimate, thus disinheriting him in favor of his younger son Augustus. The story explores themes of family, inheritance, legitimacy, and the moral complexities of a father's manipulation of the law to protect his children. Trollope examines Victorian social conventions and the tangled relationships within the Scarborough family as the truth gradually unfolds. The novel is characteristic of Trollope's later, darker work, dealing with more morally ambiguous characters and situations than his earlier, more optimistic novels.
</summarium>
    <notae>This was Trollope's last completed novel before his death in 1882, published serially in All the Year Round from May 1882 to June 1883, and in book form in 1883. The year 1883 represents both the book publication date and is most historically accurate for cataloging purposes, as this was when it became widely available to readers.

    <summarium>'Contes de la Bécasse' (Tales of the Woodcock) is a collection of short stories by Guy de Maupassant, one of the masters of the French short story form. The collection is framed by a narrative device: a group of hunters gathers at the estate of Baron des Ravots, and each hunter tells a story. The frame story involves the aging baron, now paralyzed and confined to his chair, who still shoots pigeons from his window and loves to hear tales. Maupassant's stories in this collection showcase his characteristic style: sharp psychological insight, irony, and often dark or cynical views of human nature. The tales range from tragic to comic, exploring themes of love, deception, social class, and the human condition in late 19th-century France. Maupassant is considered one of the fathers of the modern short story, and this collection demonstrates his mastery of compressed narrative and his naturalist approach to depicting reality.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1883. This is an original work by Maupassant, not a translation. The Gutenberg text indicates this is the 16th edition published in Paris in 1894, but the original publication date was 1883, which is the historically relevant date for a timeline of literary works. Maupassant (1850-1893) was at the height of his powers in the early 1880s.

    <summarium>'Beacon Lights of History' is a multi-volume series of historical lectures by John Lord (1810-1894), an American historian and lecturer who was enormously popular in the 19th century. Volume I focuses on 'The Old Pagan Civilizations,' examining ancient societies before Christianity. Lord was known for his engaging lecture style that made history accessible to general audiences. His work aimed to illuminate the great figures and movements of history, showing how they shaped civilization. The series was widely used in schools and for self-education in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lord presents history through a Christian lens, interpreting ancient civilizations in light of their relationship to what he saw as the inevitable progress toward Christian civilization.
</summarium>
    <notae>The complete 'Beacon Lights of History' series was published between 1883-1896. Volume I was among the first volumes published around 1883. Lord died in 1894, and some later volumes were completed posthumously. While Lord was a Protestant Christian writing from a Christian worldview, this is not a Catholic work and would not receive a nihil obstat or imprimatur. The work represents 19th-century American Protestant historiography with its characteristic interpretation of history as progressive revelation leading to Christian civilization.

    <summarium>'Twixt France and Spain is a Victorian-era travel narrative by E. Ernest Bilbrough describing his spring journey through the Pyrenees mountain region between France and Spain. The book focuses particularly on the town of Pau and surrounding areas, providing detailed descriptions of hotels, pensions, historical sites (including the castle of Pau and its connection to Henry IV), natural scenery, local customs, and various excursions to nearby locations such as Bétharram, Lescar, and Coarraze. The work is typical of 19th-century travel literature, offering both practical information for travelers and picturesque observations of the landscape, architecture, and local life in this border region.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year is estimated to be around 1883 based on the style and content of Victorian travel literature. The work represents the genre of travel writing popular in the late 19th century when the Pyrenees became an increasingly fashionable destination for British tourists seeking health, scenery, and Continental culture. The book's focus on Pau reflects the town's status as a popular British winter and spring resort during this period.

    <summarium>This is a comprehensive academic survey of modern Western philosophy, tracing its development from the Renaissance philosopher Nicholas of Cusa (15th century) through the late 19th century. Written by German philosopher Richard Falckenberg, Professor at the University of Erlangen, this work was designed as a middle-ground textbook—more detailed than brief compendiums but more accessible than exhaustive multi-volume histories. Falckenberg studied under major German philosophers including Kuno Fischer, Lotze, and J.E. Erdmann, and this work reflects the rigorous German academic tradition of philosophical historiography. The book would have covered major figures like Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, the British empiricists, Kant, and the German idealists, making it a standard reference work for university philosophy students of its era.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year chosen (1886) represents the first German edition publication date, which would precede this 1893 &quot;Third American from the Second German Edition.&quot; This is an original scholarly work rather than a translation of older material, so the original publication date is most historically relevant. The work is not categorized as 'catholic' despite Nicholas of Cusa being a Catholic cardinal, because Falckenberg himself was writing in the German academic tradition of his time, and the work is a scholarly survey rather than a work of Catholic philosophy per se.

    <summarium>This is a literary hoax by Franklin H. Head that presents itself as a scholarly examination of William Shakespeare's supposed insomnia. The work uses the framing device of analyzing fictitious letters to explore the phenomenon of sleeplessness, particularly as it affects men in active professional life past their mid-thirties. While ostensibly about Shakespeare, it appears to be more of a late 19th-century meditation on the modern problem of insomnia, attributing it to the rapid pace of industrial society, telegraphs, railroads, and intense business competition. The work is notable as an example of the &quot;literary hoax&quot; genre popular in the Victorian era, where fictional scholarly works were presented as genuine historical or literary analysis.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1887 is clearly stated on the title page. This work is not appropriate for the 'catholic' tag as Franklin H. Head was not a Catholic author writing from a Catholic perspective. It's also not truly 'appropriate-for-children' as it's a somewhat sophisticated literary hoax dealing with adult themes of professional stress and insomnia. The tag 'literary-hoax' is particularly important here as the work explicitly acknowledges its fictional nature.

It was part of the influential 'Story of the Nations' series published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, which aimed to provide accessible national histories for general readers. Lawless, an Anglo-Irish novelist and historian, presents Ireland's complex history including its Celtic origins, Viking invasions, Norman conquest, English colonization, religious conflicts, and the struggle for independence. The work is notable for its attempt at balanced perspective during a contentious period in Irish-British relations. This edition includes additions by Mrs. Arthur Bronson and was dedicated to the Earl of Dufferin, then Viceroy of India.

    <notae>The first edition was published in 1887, though this Project Gutenberg text appears to be from an 1896 edition (as shown on the title page). I've chosen 1887 as the primary date since that represents the original publication and historical context of the work. Emily Lawless (1845-1913) was a significant literary figure of her time, and this was one of her major historical works alongside her novels about Irish life.

The book was widely used as a civics textbook in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and represents an important contribution to American political education during the post-Civil War era.

    <summarium>&quot;L'inutile Beauté&quot; (Useless Beauty) is a collection of short stories by French author Guy de Maupassant, published in 1890, one of his final works before his mental decline. The collection includes several of Maupassant's later stories that showcase his mature style and often darker, more psychologically complex themes. The title story explores themes of beauty, vanity, marriage, and the relationships between men and women in bourgeois society. Maupassant was a master of the short story form and this collection demonstrates his skill at portraying human nature with both cynicism and compassion. His works often examined the social dynamics of late 19th-century France, particularly focusing on the middle and upper classes.

    <summarium>'Without Dogma' is a psychological novel by Nobel Prize-winning Polish author Henryk Sienkiewicz, presented as the diary of Leon Płoszowski, a wealthy, overeducated Polish aristocrat suffering from excessive skepticism and inability to commit to beliefs or action. Unlike Sienkiewicz's famous historical epics ('Quo Vadis', 'The Trilogy'), this is a modern psychological study exploring themes of paralysis by analysis, the crisis of faith in the late 19th century, and the dangers of excessive intellectualism without moral grounding. The protagonist represents the spiritual malaise of the modern educated European who, having questioned all dogmas and traditions, finds himself unable to act or love decisively. It's considered one of Sienkiewicz's most philosophically profound works, and reflects Catholic concerns about the corrosive effects of radical skepticism and relativism on the soul.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was originally published in Polish in 1891. This translation by Iza Young appeared in 1893. I chose 1891 as it represents the original publication date of the work itself. Sienkiewicz was a devout Catholic, and while this novel is a psychological portrait rather than explicitly religious literature, it carries strong Catholic philosophical underpinnings in its critique of moral relativism and dogma-less existence. The work would likely have received ecclesiastical approval given its moral framework, though it deals with mature themes of existential crisis unsuitable for children.

    <summarium>The Great Shadow is a historical novel by Arthur Conan Doyle set during the Napoleonic Wars. The 'shadow' refers to the looming threat of Napoleon Bonaparte over Britain during the early 19th century. The main story follows a young Scottish boy's coming of age against the backdrop of the Napoleonic threat, culminating in the Battle of Waterloo. The book includes other Napoleonic tales featuring Conan Doyle's character Brigadier Gerard, a humorous French cavalry officer. Written during Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes era, it demonstrates his versatility as a writer and his interest in historical fiction. The work combines adventure, romance, and historical detail in an accessible narrative style suitable for younger readers while still engaging adults.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1892. While Conan Doyle was born into a Catholic family and educated at Stonyhenge preparatory school and Stonyhurst College (both Jesuit institutions), he later became agnostic, so I have not included the 'catholic' tag. The work itself is adventure fiction without particular religious content, though it reflects Victorian-era British values and patriotism. The Brigadier Gerard stories became some of Conan Doyle's personal favorites among his own works.

    <summarium>'Les Demi-Vierges' (The Half-Virgins) is a controversial novel by French writer Marcel Prévost that examines the behavior and moral condition of young women in late 19th-century Parisian high society. The work critiques what Prévost saw as a dangerous new type of young woman who, while technically maintaining virginity, engaged in flirtatious behavior and worldly sophistication that contradicted traditional Catholic ideals of feminine purity. The novel sparked significant debate in its time about female education, morality, and the institution of Christian marriage. Prévost was concerned about the influence of Anglo-Saxon 'flirting' culture on French society and argued that modern education was creating young women incompatible with traditional Christian marriage. The preface (included in this text) defends his observations and clarifies that he was describing a specific minority within the Parisian leisure class, not all French women.
</summarium>
    <notae>The novel was first published in 1894 and became one of Marcel Prévost's most famous and controversial works. It was initially serialized in a Parisian magazine before book publication. While Prévost was a French Catholic writer, this particular work's provocative subject matter and the moral concerns it addresses would likely have been considered controversial even within Catholic circles, thus it may not have received official ecclesiastical approval (nihil obstat/imprimatur). The work is more of a social critique with Catholic moral framework rather than devotional literature.

This particular volume covers Thomas Jefferson's presidency from March 4, 1801 to March 4, 1809. The work includes biographical information about Jefferson, his official messages to Congress, proclamations, executive orders, and other presidential papers. Richardson's compilation was the first comprehensive collection of presidential documents and became a standard reference work for American historical and political research. The text begins with a biographical sketch of Jefferson, detailing his birth at Shadwell in 1743, his education at William and Mary, his role in drafting the Declaration of Independence, his governorship of Virginia, and his diplomatic service in France before becoming the first Secretary of State under Washington and eventually the third President.
</summarium>
    <notae>The original compilation was published in multiple volumes between 1896-1899.

The book includes a detailed study of the U.S. Constitution and covers various levels of government, starting with local town government and progressing to broader governmental concepts. McCleary's pedagogical approach, developed over eighteen years of teaching experience, emphasizes beginning with observable local institutions before moving to more abstract concepts.

    <summarium>'The Romance of Zion Chapel' is a novel by Richard Le Gallienne that satirizes late Victorian English Nonconformist chapel culture. The story follows Theophil Flowers, a young man raised in the rigid environment of a dissenting chapel in the fictional town of Coalchester, who becomes torn between his religious upbringing and his growing attraction to art, beauty, and the Aesthetic movement. The novel explores themes of provincial narrowness versus cosmopolitan sophistication, religious constraint versus artistic freedom, and includes a romantic subplot involving the character Jenny. It's characteristic of 1890s literature with its focus on aestheticism and critique of middle-class morality.
</summarium>
    <notae>Publication date of 1898 is clearly stated on the title page. Le Gallienne was not a Catholic author - he came from a Nonconformist Protestant background and was associated with the Aesthetic movement. This work satirizes Protestant chapel culture rather than representing Catholic thought, so 'catholic' tag is not applicable.

    <summarium>Collections and Recollections is a collection of essays and reminiscences by George William Erskine Russell (1853-1919), a British Liberal politician, social reformer, and author. The work contains anecdotes, observations, and recollections of Victorian society, political life, and notable personalities of the era. Russell was known for his wit, charm, and ability to capture the social atmosphere of late 19th-century England. The book was originally written at the suggestion of James Payn, the novelist and editor, to whom it was dedicated. Payn died in March 1898, the same year the book was first published. The work provides valuable insights into Victorian social customs, political culture, and the literary world of the period.</summarium>
    <notae>The dedication indicates James Payn died March 25, 1898, and mentions the papers were written at his suggestion and inscribed to him. This strongly suggests 1898 as the original publication year. The preface mentions &quot;when the book first appeared&quot; and references to &quot;this Edition&quot; suggest there were multiple editions. Russell was Anglo-Catholic in his religious views and a social reformer, but this particular work is primarily social commentary and reminiscences rather than explicitly religious content, so I have not tagged it as 'catholic' despite the author's religious background.</notae>

    <summarium>This is Volume III of Temple Scott's edited collection of Jonathan Swift's prose works, specifically focusing on Swift's writings on religion and the Church. Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was an Anglo-Irish satirist, essayist, political pamphleteer, poet, and Anglican cleric who became Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. This volume compiles his various writings on religious matters and Church governance, edited by Temple Scott with a biographical introduction by W.E.H. Lecky. Swift was known for his sharp wit and incisive commentary on both religious and political matters of his time. As an Anglican cleric, his religious writings would have been from a Protestant perspective during a period of significant religious and political tension in Ireland and England.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1898 represents the publication date of this edited collection by Temple Scott, published as part of Bohn's Standard Library. While Swift's original writings on religion and the Church would have been composed during his lifetime (late 17th/early 18th century), this is specifically an edited compilation, so 1898 is the most historically accurate date for this particular work. The individual texts within this volume would have been written by Swift between approximately 1690s-1740s, but as a collected scholarly edition, 1898 is the appropriate year.

Note: Not tagged as 'catholic' since Swift was an Anglican cleric, not Catholic. Not tagged 'appropriate-for-children' as Swift's religious and political writings were intended for educated adult audiences and dealt with complex theological and ecclesiastical matters.

This work promotes large families and natalism as a solution to social problems, in contrast to the declining birth rates in fin-de-siècle France. The novel follows the Froment family through multiple generations, celebrating fertility, family life, and colonization as means of national regeneration. It represents Zola's mature philosophical vision and his attempt to offer positive solutions after the darker naturalist works of his earlier career. The work is part of his transition from the pessimistic determinism of the Rougon-Macquart cycle to a more optimistic, reformist vision for society.
</summarium>
    <notae>1899 is the year of original French publication. The English translation by Ernest Alfred Vizetelly followed shortly after (1900 edition shown in this text).

While Zola himself was not Catholic (he was anti-clerical and associated with secular republicanism), this work does not receive a 'catholic' tag despite its pro-natalist themes, as it approaches the subject from a secular, social-reform perspective rather than from Catholic doctrine.

Ade was an American writer and humorist known for his satirical fables written in colloquial American English of the early 20th century. His fables typically lampooned American social types and pretensions with wit and clever wordplay. The stories featured capitalized nouns and used vernacular speech to comment on modern American life, including topics like social climbers, marriage, business, and cultural trends. Ade's work was extremely popular in its time and influenced American humor writing. The fables are lighthearted moral tales with a distinctly American flavor, often ending with a humorous &quot;moral&quot; in the tradition of Aesop but applied to contemporary American society.

    <summarium>This is an early audio recording from the Edison Historic National Site, performed by the Peerless Orchestra. &quot;Ma Rag Time Baby&quot; is a ragtime composition, representing the popular music genre that dominated American entertainment from roughly 1895-1919. Ragtime was characterized by its syncopated or &quot;ragged&quot; rhythm and was a precursor to jazz. The Peerless Orchestra was a recording ensemble that made numerous recordings for Thomas Edison's phonograph company in the early 1900s. This Project Gutenberg entry is an MP3 digitization of the original Edison cylinder or disc recording.
</summarium>
    <notae>Dating early audio recordings can be imprecise, but ragtime's peak popularity was 1899-1910. The Peerless Orchestra was most active in the 1900s-1910s recording for Edison. Without access to the actual audio or more metadata, I've estimated circa 1900 as representative of the ragtime era and early Edison recording period. The actual recording could be anywhere from 1898-1915. This is primarily a historical artifact rather than a literary work - it's an audio recording, not a text.

    <summarium>A collection of religious and theological essays by Jesuit priest George Tyrrell, published while he was still in good standing with the Catholic Church. The work includes essays on spiritual topics including Juliana of Norwich, mysticism, Catholic life, and the relationship between art and faith. Tyrrell was an influential theologian who would later become a central figure in the Catholic Modernist controversy, though this work predates those conflicts and bears the official imprimatur of Cardinal Herbert Vaughan, Archbishop of Westminster.
</summarium>
    <notae>Publication year 1901 is clearly stated on the title page. This work was published before Tyrrell's involvement in the Modernist controversy that led to his excommunication in 1907. The presence of the nihil obstat and imprimatur indicates this was approved Catholic theological writing at the time of publication. Not marked as 'appropriate-for-children' as it contains theological essays intended for an educated adult audience.

    <summarium>Ten Girls from Dickens is a compilation work by Kate Dickinson Sweetser that extracts and presents the stories of ten memorable female characters from Charles Dickens' novels as standalone narratives. The book features beloved characters such as Little Nell (from The Old Curiosity Shop), The Marchioness (also from The Old Curiosity Shop), Jenny Wren (from Our Mutual Friend), and Florence Dombey (from Dombey and Son). This work was designed as a companion volume to Sweetser's 'Ten Boys from Dickens' and was intended to make Dickens' complex novels more accessible to younger readers by presenting character-focused narratives in a simplified format. The book was illustrated by George Alfred Williams and represents the early 20th century educational practice of introducing children to classic literature through character studies and abridged versions.</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1901 is based on typical publication dates for Kate Dickinson Sweetser's Dickens compilation series. These works were published in the early 1900s as part of the movement to make classic literature accessible to children. While I cannot see the exact copyright date in this excerpt, Sweetser's 'Ten Boys from Dickens' was published around 1901, and this companion volume would have followed shortly after. This is not a work by Dickens himself but rather a secondary work about Dickens' characters, so the year reflects Sweetser's publication date rather than Dickens' original works (which span 1836-1870).</notae>

    <summarium>An early automobile travelogue published in 1902, documenting a pioneering journey of over two thousand miles through New England, New York, Canada, and the American West. Written under the pseudonym &quot;Chauffeur,&quot; this work captures the adventure and novelty of long-distance automobile travel in the very early days of the automotive age, when such journeys were still rare and challenging undertakings. The narrative is described as &quot;desultory&quot; (rambling or digressive), suggesting an informal, conversational style. The book includes eighteen illustrations by Frank Verbeck and is dedicated to &quot;L. O. E.&quot; who accompanied the author for much of the journey. This work serves as both a historical document of early automotive culture and a snapshot of American geography and infrastructure at the turn of the 20th century.

    <summarium>'Beacon Lights of History' is a comprehensive lecture series by American historian John Lord (1810-1894), covering major figures and movements in Western civilization. Volume X focuses on European leaders of the 19th century, particularly British political figures during the reform era. This volume examines the period of William IV's reign and the subsequent reform movements, including the Great Reform Act of 1832, the abolition of slavery, and the repeal of the Corn Laws. Lord covers key statesmen like Lord Grey, Sir Robert Peel, Lord Melbourne, and the Duke of Wellington. The series was hugely popular in its time as public lectures and later as published volumes, known for making history accessible and morally instructive to general audiences.
</summarium>
    <notae>Dating this work requires some explanation. John Lord delivered these lectures throughout the 1870s-1880s and died in 1894. However, the complete 15-volume series 'Beacon Lights of History' was published posthumously, with later volumes edited and compiled after his death. Volume X specifically was published around 1902. Since this is a historical work about 19th century figures rather than a primary source from that period, I've chosen 1902 as the most historically accurate publication date. This distinguishes it from the events it describes (1830s-1840s) and represents when this particular volume became available to readers.

    <summarium>'The Lady of the Barge and Other Stories' is a collection of short stories by English humorist and author W. W. Jacobs, first published in 1902. The collection is perhaps best known for containing 'The Monkey's Paw,' one of the most famous horror stories in English literature. However, most stories in the collection are humorous tales about sailormen and dockside life, written in Jacobs' characteristic style featuring working-class vernacular dialogue and gentle comedy. 'Bill's Paper Chase' is one of these lighter nautical tales, featuring the night watchman narrator who appears in many of Jacobs' stories, recounting humorous anecdotes about sailors and their adventures.

    <notae>1902 is the original publication date of 'The Lady of the Barge and Other Stories' collection. W. W. Jacobs (1863-1943) was a prolific writer of humorous short stories, primarily about dockworkers and sailors in London.

His stories typically feature working-class characters and gentle comedy of manners, though &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; stands out as a darker work exploring themes of fate and the dangers of interfering with destiny.

    <summarium>'The Grip of Desire' (French: 'L'Étreinte du Désir') is a controversial novel by Hector France subtitled 'The Story of a Parish-Priest'. The novel deals with the struggles of a Catholic priest with celibacy and sexual desire. France was a French journalist and author known for his anti-clerical works in the late 19th/early 20th century. This work was considered scandalous at the time of publication for its frank treatment of priestly sexuality and its critique of Catholic clerical celibacy requirements.
</summarium>
    <notae>The original French edition was published around 1903. Hector France (1837-1908) was a controversial French author known for his anti-clerical and libertine works. This novel is explicitly anti-clerical in nature and would definitely NOT be considered appropriate for children or receive a nihil obstat or imprimatur from Catholic authorities, despite dealing with Catholic clergy as subject matter.

    <summarium>This is an audio recording of remarks from Addie Worth Bagley Daniels describing her visit to Thomas Edison's laboratory. The recording is part of the Edison National Historic Site collection and provides a first-hand account of observations at one of America's most important centers of invention during the early 20th century. Edison's laboratory was the birthplace of numerous groundbreaking inventions including the phonograph, motion pictures, and improvements to electric lighting. This primary source document offers historical insight into Edison's work environment and operations.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact year is difficult to determine from the Gutenberg text alone, as it doesn't specify when the visit or recording took place. Edison's main laboratory period was from the 1870s through early 1900s, with his West Orange laboratory (which became the Edison National Historic Site) operating from 1887-1931. Given that this appears to be an audio recording (available as MP3 files) and edited by Edison himself, I've estimated circa 1903 as a reasonable midpoint of Edison's most productive laboratory years and when audio recording technology would have been available. The actual recording could be anywhere from roughly 1890-1920s. The Gutenberg release date (2003) is clearly just the digitization date, not the original work date.

This particular story features one of his recurring characters, a night-watchman who serves as narrator, philosophizing about love and its complications in his distinctive working-class voice.

The story is told by an elderly narrator who recounts the exploits of Bob Pretty, a notorious poacher and clever schemer in a rural English village. Jacobs was known for his comic tales of English country life and seafaring adventures, with a gift for dialect and character. His stories often featured working-class characters engaged in petty schemes and comedic misunderstandings. This particular tale is characteristic of his gentle, humorous style that made him one of the most popular English short story writers of the early 20th century.

    <summarium>'The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science' is a foundational text in the New Thought movement, originally delivered as lectures in Edinburgh's Queen Street Hall in 1904. Thomas Troward, a retired divisional judge from Punjab, India, presents a systematic exploration of the relationship between mental action and material conditions. The work examines concepts such as spirit and matter, subjective and objective mind, intuition, healing, and the will. Troward's lectures were influential in the development of New Thought philosophy and later influenced various self-help and metaphysical movements. The book attempts to establish natural principles governing how thought influences reality, blending elements of philosophy, psychology, and metaphysics.

While Thomas Troward was nominally Christian, this is decidedly not a Catholic work - it belongs to the New Thought movement which has different theological foundations. Therefore, it does not receive the 'catholic' tag.

The stories were originally published in The Strand Magazine between 1903-1904 before being collected in book form. The opening story, &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House,&quot; explains Holmes's survival and three-year absence. These tales represent some of the most beloved Holmes mysteries, including &quot;The Adventure of the Dancing Men&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons.&quot;
</summarium>
    <notae>The stories were serialized 1903-1904, with the book collection published in 1905. I chose 1905 as it represents the complete work as a unified collection. Doyle was raised Catholic but left the faith as an adult, becoming interested in spiritualism, so this work does not receive a 'catholic' tag despite his background.

    <summarium>'The Second Generation' is a novel by David Graham Phillips, an American \
journalist and novelist who was part of the muckraking movement. Phillips was \
known for his social realist fiction that criticized American society, \
particularly the wealthy class and political corruption. This novel explores \
themes common to Phillips' work: the inheritance of wealth, the moral decay of \
the upper classes, and the challenges faced by those who inherit rather than \
earn their fortunes. The chapter titles suggest a narrative about family \
legacy, wills, legal matters, and romantic entanglements within the context of \
generational wealth transfer. Phillips' work often examined how second-generation \
wealth affected character and society.\
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1906 is clearly indicated on the title page. This was during Phillips' \
most productive period as a novelist. He was not a Catholic author - he was a \
secular progressive reformer and muckraker who was critical of many American \
institutions. The work would not be considered suitable for an imprimatur. \
Phillips was assassinated in 1911 by a man who believed one of his novels \
defamed his family.\

    <summarium>This is a curated collection of Robert Louis Stevenson's personal essays, edited by William Lyon Phelps and published in 1906, two years after Stevenson's death in 1894. The collection focuses on essays that reveal Stevenson's personality, character, and philosophy rather than his formal literary criticism. Notable essays include 'An Apology for Idlers,' 'Aes Triplex' (a meditation on mortality and courage), 'On the Enjoyment of Unpleasant Places,' and 'Talk and Talkers.' Stevenson (1850-1894) was a Scottish novelist and essayist best known for 'Treasure Island' and 'Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.' His essays are celebrated for their elegant prose style, optimistic philosophy despite his chronic illness, and insights into the art of living well. This particular edition was designed for educational use in schools and colleges.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1906 as the year because this is a posthumous editorial collection published specifically in this form. While the individual essays were written earlier (during Stevenson's lifetime, primarily in the 1870s-1880s), this particular work as a unified, edited volume with Phelps's introduction and notes is a 1906 publication. For a historical timeline, this represents when this influential educational edition entered circulation and helped establish Stevenson's essays as part of the English literary canon in American academia. If you prefer the dates when the individual essays were originally published, those would range from approximately 1876-1887, but that seems less appropriate for this specific editorial collection.

    <summarium>'Friday, the Thirteenth' is a novel by Thomas W. Lawson, an American stock promoter and author, that explores Wall Street manipulation and stock market schemes. Published in 1907 during the era of financial excess and market manipulation, the book is a semi-autobiographical financial thriller that exposed the practices of stock market operators and corporate raiders. Lawson himself was involved in various financial schemes and stock promotions, lending authenticity to his fictional portrayal of market manipulation. The novel was quite popular in its time and contributed to public discourse about financial reform and market regulation during the Progressive Era.

    <notae>The copyright page shows both 1906 and 1907 dates, with publication listed as February 1907. I chose 1907 as the primary year since that's when it was formally published. The book was written during a period of significant financial turmoil leading up to the Panic of 1907, and Lawson's insider perspective on market manipulation made this work particularly relevant to contemporary readers concerned about financial corruption.

    <summarium>Part of the popular 'Little Cousin Series' published in the early 20th century, this book was designed to introduce American children to the lives, customs, and cultures of people in Alaska. The series as a whole aimed to foster understanding and appreciation of different peoples and places around the world through engaging stories about children from various regions. This particular volume would have provided young readers with insights into Alaskan life, indigenous peoples, and the unique environment of America's northern territory during a period of growing American interest in the region following the Gold Rush and prior to statehood.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact publication year is not visible in the provided excerpt, but the Little Cousin Series was most actively published between 1901-1910. The year 1907 is an educated estimate based on the series' publication pattern and Alaska's historical context during this period. Alaska wouldn't become a state until 1959, so this book represents an early 20th century American perspective on the territory.

    <summarium>'The Long Shadow' is a Western novel by B.M. Bower (pen name of Bertha Muzzy Sinclair), one of the first successful female authors of Western fiction. The novel is set in the American West during the early 20th century and follows the story of 'Charming Billy' and other cowboys as they navigate the changing landscape of the range. The book explores themes of frontier life, romance, and the transformation of the Old West as modernization encroaches. Bower was known for her realistic portrayal of cowboy life and her ability to capture the spirit of the Western range, drawing on her own experiences living in Montana.

    <notae>Copyright date of 1908 matches the original publication year. B.M. Bower (Bertha Muzzy Sinclair) was a pioneering female Western writer who wrote over 60 novels.

    <summarium>'Buried Alive: A Tale of These Days' is a comedic novel by English author Arnold Bennett, first published in 1908. The story follows Priam Farll, a famous but reclusive painter who is terrified of public attention. When his valet dies suddenly, Farll sees an opportunity to escape his fame by switching identities with the deceased servant. The novel satirizes English society, fame, and the art world of the Edwardian era. Bennett was known for his realistic portrayals of English provincial life, though this work is more comedic and fantastic in nature. The book was later adapted into a play and film.</summarium>
    <notae>1908 is the original publication year. Arnold Bennett was not a Catholic author - he came from a Methodist background and later became more secular/agnostic in his views. The novel is lighthearted comedy/satire rather than having religious themes, so it does not qualify for the 'catholic' tag. The dedication to John Frederick Farrar (identified as M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. - medical qualifications) suggests a personal friendship, and Bennett humorously calls him a 'collaborator' though this appears to be affectionate jest rather than literal co-authorship.</notae>

Crawford was known for his detailed portrayals of Italian life and society, and this work continues that tradition while focusing on the dramatic world of opera performance.

It includes sermons from prominent English-speaking Protestant divines of the Reformation and post-Reformation period. Thomas Hooker, the first preacher featured, was a Cambridge-educated Puritan who fled England under Archbishop Laud's persecution and became a founder of Connecticut. The anthology serves as both a theological resource and a historical document of Christian preaching during a pivotal period in English and American religious history.

    <notae>The year 1908 is estimated based on Grenville Kleiser's active publishing period and typical publication dates for such anthologies.

    <summarium>This is an early audio recording from the Edison era, part of the Edison National Historic Site collection. George P. Watson performed this piece, which was edited by Thomas A. Edison. The title &quot;Does Your Mother Know You're Out?&quot; suggests it's likely a comedic or vaudeville-style performance piece typical of the early recording industry. This represents an important piece of audio history from the pioneering days of sound recording technology.
</summarium>
    <notae>The exact year is difficult to determine from the Gutenberg metadata alone. Edison's peak recording years were roughly 1890s-1920s. Given Watson's involvement and Edison's editorial role, this likely dates to the 1900s-1910s era of cylinder or early disc recordings. I've estimated ~1909 as a reasonable midpoint of Edison's active recording period, but the actual recording date could range from approximately 1895-1920.

    <summarium>'Chivalry' is a collection of romantic historical tales by James Branch Cabell, one of America's most distinctive early 20th-century writers. The work consists of interconnected stories set in medieval times, exploring themes of romance, honor, and idealized love through various historical and legendary figures. Cabell was known for his elaborate prose style, ironic wit, and creation of an intricate fictional genealogy connecting his various works. This book fits into his larger 'Biography of the Life of Manuel' series, which traces an imaginary lineage through romantic and chivalric tales. The work reflects Cabell's fascination with medieval romance traditions and his characteristic blend of romanticism and skepticism.
</summarium>
    <notae>While this Project Gutenberg edition is dated 1921, 'Chivalry' was originally published in 1909 by Harper &amp; Brothers. The 1921 date likely refers to a revised or reissued edition. I've chosen 1909 as the historically accurate publication year for the original work. Cabell revised and republished several of his works throughout his career, particularly after the controversy surrounding 'Jurgen' (1919) brought him wider attention. The dedication to 'Anne Branch Cabell' and the introduction discussing Cabell's cohesive body of work suggest this may be from a later collected edition, but the work itself originates from 1909.

    <summarium>This is an early audio recording from the Edison cylinder era, featuring Ada Jones performing a comedic dialogue between two Irish-American women gossiping over the backyard fence. Ada Jones (1873-1922) was one of the most prolific and popular recording artists of the early phonograph era, known especially for her ethnic comedy routines and character voices. This type of 'backyard conversation' sketch was a popular vaudeville and phonograph format in the early 1900s, representing everyday immigrant life with humor and dialect. The recording comes from the Edison National Historic Site collection.</summarium>
    <notae>The exact recording date is difficult to pinpoint from this metadata alone. Ada Jones was most active recording for Edison between roughly 1905-1920. Given the title format and the Edison cylinder context, I'm estimating circa 1910 as a reasonable middle point of her peak recording period, though it could range anywhere from 1905-1915.

The stories follow a consistent structure where Carnacki invites a small group of friends to dinner and then recounts his latest investigation. Hodgson blends supernatural horror with pseudo-scientific explanations, as Carnacki uses both occult knowledge and invented devices like the 'Electric Pentacle' to combat paranormal threats. The collection includes some of Hodgson's most famous stories, including 'The Gateway of the Monster,' 'The House Among the Laurels,' and 'The Whistling Room.' Hodgson was an innovative early 20th-century writer who significantly influenced the development of both supernatural horror and weird fiction.

    <summarium>&quot;The Money Moon&quot; is a romantic novel by British author Jeffery Farnol, published in 1911. Farnol was known for his romantic historical and adventure novels written in a distinctive style that often featured pastoral English settings. This work is a lighter romance compared to his more famous novel &quot;The Broad Highway&quot; (1910). The story involves George Bellew and a character called &quot;Small Porges&quot; in what appears to be a pastoral English setting.

    <summarium>This is Eugene Mason's 1911 English translation of the Lays of Marie de France, supplemented with additional medieval romance stories. Marie de France was a 12th-century poet (likely writing c. 1160-1178) who composed narrative poems in Anglo-Norman French. She is one of the earliest known female authors in European vernacular literature. Her lays are short narrative poems that typically deal with courtly love, chivalry, and Celtic folklore themes. The collection focuses primarily on romantic love and represents an important window into medieval literary culture and the rare voice of a medieval woman artist. The translator notes this may be the fullest English version of Marie's lays available at that time.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1911 represents the publication year of this specific translation by Eugene Mason. The original lays by Marie de France date from approximately 1160-1178 in the 12th century. Since this is a translation collection rather than the original medieval texts, and the use case is a historical timeline where the translation itself has scholarly and historical value, 1911 is the most appropriate date. If you wanted to represent Marie de France's original composition period instead, approximately 1170 would be more accurate.

    <summarium>&quot;The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol&quot; is an early 20th century juvenile adventure novel featuring the Boy Scouts of America movement. Written by Lieut. Howard Payson, it follows a group of boy scouts called the Eagle Patrol through various outdoor adventures, mysteries, and challenges. The story includes typical elements of early Boy Scout fiction: camping, tracking, rescues, competitions, and character-building scenarios. The book was part of the explosion of Boy Scout literature that followed the founding of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910, designed to promote the values and activities of the scouting movement to young readers.
</summarium>
    <notae>The Boy Scouts of America was founded in 1910, and this appears to be one of the early Boy Scout series books published shortly thereafter, likely around 1911-1913. I've chosen 1911 as a reasonable estimate for when this type of early BSA fiction would have been published, during the initial wave of Boy Scout enthusiasm. The &quot;Lieut. Howard Payson&quot; byline was likely a pseudonym used by the Stratemeyer Syndicate or similar publisher of juvenile series books, as was common practice for this type of literature. Without access to the copyright page, 1911 represents the most historically appropriate year for this early Boy Scout adventure series.

    <summarium>'Ship's Company' is a collection of humorous short stories by W.W. Jacobs featuring recurring characters Sam Small, Ginger Dick, and Peter Russet - three sailors whose adventures and misadventures in London's docklands provide the basis for lighthearted tales of working-class life. Jacobs was a master of the humorous short story and dialect writing, capturing the vernacular and spirit of maritime workers at the turn of the 20th century. While he is best known today for his horror story 'The Monkey's Paw,' the majority of his work consisted of these gentle comedies about sailors, night-watchmen, and dock workers. 'The Guardian Angel' is one story from this collection, demonstrating Jacobs' skill at character-driven humor and his affectionate portrayal of working-class camaraderie and conflict.

    <notae>Year chosen is 1911, the publication date of the 'Ship's Company' collection. W.W. Jacobs (1863-1943) was an English author who wrote primarily in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, with his most productive years being roughly 1896-1926.

    <summarium>This is the eighth volume of a comprehensive Catholic history of England, originally written by John Lingard (1771-1851), a Catholic priest and historian whose work revolutionized English historiography by providing a scholarly, balanced Catholic perspective. This 1912 edition represents a collaboration with Hilaire Belloc and includes an introduction by Cardinal Gibbons. Volume VIII covers the reign of Charles I, including major Civil War events like the Battle of Edge Hill, various parliamentary negotiations, the Self-Denying Ordinance, and the trial and execution of Archbishop Laud. Lingard's original work (1819-1830) was groundbreaking for its use of primary sources and relatively objective treatment of controversial religious and political events in English history.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1912 is chosen because this is explicitly a revised/collaborative edition with Belloc's contributions and Cardinal Gibbons' introduction, making it a distinct work from Lingard's original 1819-1830 publication.

    <summarium>'The Night-Born' is a collection of ten short stories by American author Jack London, published in 1913. The collection showcases London's characteristic exploration of human nature, violence, survival, and the primitive within civilization. The stories range from boxing matches to tales of adventure, reflecting London's naturalistic style and his fascination with the raw, primal aspects of human experience. Jack London (1876-1918) was one of the most popular American writers of the early 20th century, known for works like 'The Call of the Wild' and 'White Fang'. This collection represents his mature period as a short story writer.

    <notae>Year chosen is 1913, the original publication date of this short story collection. While individual stories may have appeared in magazines earlier, 1913 is when they were collected and published together as 'The Night-Born'.

This particular recording is a historic audio document performed by the National Promenade Band under conductor Eugene A. Jaudas, recorded in New York City on December 29, 1913. The recording represents an early example of tango music being performed and recorded in the United States, capturing the international spread of the Argentine tango during the early 20th century.

    <summarium>A firsthand eyewitness account by Flemish Belgian writer Jozef Muls documenting \

War I. The work provides a detailed chronological narrative from the last days of \
peace through the German bombardment, the civilian experience during the siege, \
the chaos of evacuation, and the ultimate fall of the city. Written in Dutch, it \
captures the perspective of civilians caught in one of the major military \
engagements of the early months of WWI, including observations of the Zeppelin \
raids, the defense of the Belgian forts, the arrival of Cardinal Mercier, and the \
mass exodus of approximately 100,000 refugees. The work is considered an important \
primary source document of Belgian history and the civilian experience of WWI.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1914 as the year because this appears to be a contemporary account written \
during or immediately after the events described (the fall of Antwerp occurred on \
October 10, 1914). While the actual publication to print may have been in 1915, \
the work documents 1914 events and was likely composed in 1914. For historical \
timeline purposes, 1914 is the most accurate date as it represents when the events \
occurred and when the account was written. The Project Gutenberg number (11500) \

Jacobs was known for his comic tales of everyday English life, particularly stories involving working-class characters, sailors, and domestic situations.

A kolo is a traditional Slavic circle dance, and this appears to be a Christmas-themed version. The tamburitza is a family of long-necked string instruments traditional to Southern Slavic peoples. This recording comes from the Thomas Edison collection at the Edison National Historic Site, representing an important piece of early 20th century immigrant musical heritage in America, as Yugoslav communities maintained their cultural traditions through such musical performances.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1915 is an educated estimate based on the context of Edison's recording activities and the period of Yugoslav immigration to America. Edison's phonograph recording activities were most active from the 1890s through the 1920s. Yugoslav tamburitza societies flourished in American immigrant communities during this period. Without access to the actual audio file or more specific dating information in the metadata, the exact recording date cannot be determined with certainty, but it likely falls somewhere between 1900-1925.

The series popularized the 'Yellow Peril' thriller genre in early 20th century literature, depicting exotic Oriental villainy against Western heroes. While the books were enormously popular in their time, they are now recognized as products of their era's problematic racial stereotypes and Orientalist attitudes.

    <summarium>'Wee Macgreegor Enlists' is a novel by Scottish author J.J. Bell, part of his popular series about the character Wee Macgreegor (MacGregor), a Glasgow boy whose adventures were told in Scottish dialect. This installment, published during World War I, follows MacGregor as he enlists in the military. The book captures the home front experience and the transition from civilian to military life during the Great War, written with Bell's characteristic humor and warmth. The series was extremely popular in Scotland and gave readers a glimpse into working-class Glasgow life through dialect fiction. The chapter titles suggest a romantic subplot alongside the military storyline.
</summarium>
    <notae>1916 is the clear publication year for this edition. J.J. Bell's Wee Macgreegor series began earlier (the first book was published in 1902), but this specific war-time installment was published in 1916 during World War I, making it both a work of fiction and a period piece reflecting contemporary events.

    <summarium>This is a collection of two Western short stories by Eugene Manlove Rhodes, one of the most celebrated writers of the American West. Rhodes was known for his authentic portrayal of cowboys and ranch life in New Mexico and the Southwest. &quot;The Desire of the Moth&quot; is the lead story, featuring John Wesley Pringle in the landscape around the Organ Mountains of New Mexico. Rhodes' work is characterized by literate cowboys, vivid descriptions of the Western landscape, and a romantic but realistic portrayal of frontier life. His stories often featured themes of honor, loyalty, and the code of the West, written with literary sophistication uncommon in Western fiction of the era.
</summarium>
    <notae>&quot;The Desire of the Moth&quot; was first published in 1916, along with &quot;The Come On&quot; in a single volume by Henry Holt and Company. Rhodes wrote most of his work between 1900-1930, and this represents his mature period. He is sometimes called the &quot;novelist laureate of the cattle range&quot; and his work influenced later Western writers. The year 1916 represents the original book publication of these two stories together.

    <summarium>This is a biography of Ernest Psichari (1883-1914), written by Henri Massis and published in 1916, shortly after Psichari's death in World War I. Ernest Psichari was a French soldier, writer, and religious thinker who became an important figure in the French Catholic intellectual revival of the early 20th century. He was the grandson of Ernest Renan, the famous anti-clerical philosopher, which made his own conversion to Catholicism in 1913 particularly significant to his contemporaries. Psichari served in the French colonial army in the Congo and Mauritania, and wrote autobiographical works about military life. After his conversion, he considered becoming a priest but decided to serve the Church through his military vocation instead. He was killed at the Battle of Rossignol in Belgium on August 22, 1914, at age 30. Massis's biography documents Psichari's spiritual journey and military career, portraying him as a Catholic soldier-intellectual.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen: 1916 is the publication date of this biography by Henri Massis, published by l'Art Catholique in Paris. This is appropriate since the work is Massis's biographical account written after Psichari's death, not Psichari's own writings. The biography would have received ecclesiastical approval given its publication by a Catholic publisher and its subject matter celebrating a Catholic convert.

    <summarium>The Adventures of Jimmie Dale is an early crime adventure novel featuring one of the first masked hero archetypes in popular fiction. The protagonist, Jimmie Dale, is a wealthy New York socialite who secretly operates as &quot;The Gray Seal,&quot; a mysterious vigilante who solves crimes and rights wrongs while leaving his signature gray seal as a calling card. The novel combines elements of mystery, adventure, and romance, and was highly influential in establishing tropes later used in pulp fiction and superhero stories. Packard's creation predated characters like The Shadow and influenced the development of the vigilante hero archetype in American popular culture.
</summarium>
    <notae>First published in 1917, though it was serialized in People's Magazine beginning in 1914. I've used the 1917 book publication date as it represents the complete work. This was the first of several Jimmie Dale novels by Packard, establishing a popular series in the early 20th century.

    <summarium>Punch was Britain's most famous and long-running humor and satire magazine, published from 1841 to 1992. This issue from November 14, 1917, comes from the final year of World War I and contains typical Punch content: satirical commentary on current events, humorous observations about British society and politics, jokes about wartime conditions, and witty social commentary. The &quot;Charivaria&quot; section shown here features brief humorous observations about the Foreign Office, spy cases, street crime, and wartime bread rationing. Punch was influential in British culture and known for coining terms like &quot;cartoon&quot; in its modern sense.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year chosen is 1917, the actual publication date of this specific issue. While Punch magazine began in 1841, this is a single dated issue from WWI-era Britain. The content includes wartime references such as spies, rationing, and Sir Arthur Yapp (a prominent wartime administrator). Not appropriate for children due to some of the humor being contextual to adult topics of the era.

    <summarium>This is an audio recording of the jazz/ragtime standard &quot;Dixieland&quot; (also known as &quot;Original Dixieland One-Step&quot;) performed by Lopez and Hamilton's Kings of Harmony. The recording comes from the Edison National Historic Site archives and represents early 20th century American popular music. The Original Dixieland Jass Band first recorded &quot;Dixieland Jass Band One-Step&quot; in 1917, which became one of the first jazz recordings ever made and a landmark in American music history. This Project Gutenberg entry preserves this historical audio recording in MP3 format.
</summarium>
    <notae>I've chosen 1917 as the year because that's when &quot;Dixieland&quot; (the Original Dixieland One-Step) was first recorded and became a foundational work in jazz history. While this specific performance by Lopez and Hamilton's Kings of Harmony may have been recorded slightly later (Edison made many recordings in the late 1910s-1920s), the work itself dates to 1917. For a historical timeline focused on when works entered cultural consciousness, 1917 is the most educationally appropriate date as it marks the birth of recorded jazz. If more specific recording date information for this particular Lopez and Hamilton performance were available, that could refine this estimate to perhaps 1917-1920.

    <summarium>'La veille d'armes' (The Eve of Battle) is a five-act play by French authors Claude Farrère and Lucien Népoty. The play was first performed at the Théâtre du Gymnase on January 5, 1917, during World War I. Claude Farrère (1876-1957) was a French naval officer and writer who won the Prix Goncourt in 1905 and was elected to the Académie française. Lucien Népoty (1885-1918) was a French playwright and poet who died in combat during WWI. The play's title suggests themes related to war and the anticipation before battle, which would have resonated strongly with French audiences during the Great War. As a theatrical work from this period, it likely reflects the concerns, anxieties, and patriotic sentiments of wartime France.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1917 represents the first performance date at the Théâtre du Gymnase, which is the most historically significant date for this theatrical work. This is a collaborative work between two authors, written and performed during World War I.

    <summarium>A novel by Canadian author Isabel Ecclestone Mackay (1875-1928), who was a popular poet and novelist in the early 20th century. The book appears to be a pastoral narrative, suggested by the opening scene of a traveler on a country road encountering a small boy near a swimming pool. The dedication to the author's mother and the cheerful tone suggest this may be a wholesome story of rural life or a journey narrative. Mackay was known for her accessible, optimistic writing style that often celebrated nature and simple pleasures.
</summarium>
    <notae>Isabel Ecclestone Mackay was a prominent Canadian literary figure who wrote both poetry and prose. This novel appears to have been published during World War I, though its pastoral setting suggests an escape from contemporary troubles.

    <summarium>&quot;This Is The End&quot; is a semi-autobiographical novel by English writer Stella Benson, published during World War I. The work is characteristic of early modernist fiction, featuring philosophical reflections on the arbitrary nature of reality and social conventions. The narrator introduces Jay, a bus-conductor and idealist who questions fundamental assumptions about life. The novel explores themes of uncertainty, idealism, and social observation during a time of upheaval. Benson was known for her unconventional narrative style and feminist perspectives, and this work reflects her skeptical view of established social norms and her interest in characters who exist outside conventional society.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1917 is straightforward as it appears in the text itself and matches historical records for the first publication of this novel. Stella Benson (1892-1933) was an English modernist writer who is somewhat forgotten today but was respected in her time for her innovative prose style and social commentary.

    <summarium>&quot;Growth of the Soil&quot; (Markens Grøde) is Knut Hamsun's epic novel about pioneer life in rural Norway. The story follows Isak, a solitary man who settles in the wilderness and through immense labor transforms uncultivated land into a productive farm. The novel traces his life as he builds a home, cultivates the soil, and eventually raises a family in the harsh but beautiful landscape. Hamsun won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920, and this novel is considered one of his greatest achievements. It celebrates the relationship between man and nature, the dignity of agricultural labor, and the primal connection between human beings and the earth. The work is notable for its lyrical prose and deep reverence for the land and those who work it.
</summarium>

    <summarium>The Masters of the Peaks is the fourth volume in Joseph A. Altsheler's French and Indian War Series, following the adventures of Robert Lennox (a youth of mysterious origins), Tayoga (a young Onondaga warrior), and David Willet (a hunter) during the French and Indian War. Altsheler was a prolific American author of historical adventure novels for young readers in the early 20th century. This series dramatizes the conflict between British and French forces in colonial North America (1754-1763), incorporating both historical events and fictional characters. The novels are known for their fast-paced action, wilderness settings in the Great North Woods, and portrayal of Native American allies on both sides of the conflict.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year 1918 is straightforward as this is an original work of early 20th century historical fiction, not a republication or translation of an older text. Altsheler wrote these adventure novels specifically for young American readers during the World War I era, romanticizing America's colonial past.

    <summarium>A contemporary analysis of the causes and origins of World War I (referred to as 'the great European war'), written by an American school superintendent for general audiences including children and adults. The book emerged from a series of public lectures given in fall 1914 explaining the complex political, ethnic, and territorial conflicts that made the war 'inevitable.' It aims to explain European conditions—particularly the ethnic tensions and nationalistic movements absent in America's melting pot—through simple language, maps, and charts. The work provides historical context about the 'remarkable sequence of events' leading to WWI and claims to reveal facts not previously published in histories up to that time.
</summarium>
    <notae>The book was clearly written shortly after WWI began (autumn 1914 lectures mentioned), likely published between 1916-1918. Project Gutenberg lists this as ebook #11200.

    <summarium>This groundbreaking work by Carter G. Woodson, known as the 'Father of Black History,' documents the largely unknown history of educational efforts among enslaved and free Black Americans before the Civil War. Woodson discovered that the struggle for education among Black Americans during slavery was more extensive and heroic than previously documented. The book examines how both Black and white benevolent teachers worked to educate African Americans under the most adverse circumstances, including legal prohibitions in many states. This scholarly work filled a significant gap in historical literature, as previous works had only touched on specific localities or aspects of this history. The preface indicates this was meant to be part of a larger project on Negro education but became focused on the ante-bellum period due to the compelling nature of the source material.</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1919 is the publication date as stated in the text.

As a household efficiency expert and graduate of Hunter College, Greenbaum brought scientific knowledge of food chemistry and diet to traditional Jewish cooking.

    <summarium>&quot;The Second Book of Modern Verse&quot; is an anthology of modern poetry edited by Jessie Belle Rittenhouse (1869-1948), an American poet, critic, and anthologist. This is a sequel to her earlier anthology &quot;The Little Book of Modern Verse&quot; (1913), which was highly successful. Rittenhouse was known for her role in promoting modern American poetry in the early 20th century and served as the first secretary of the Poetry Society of America. This collection features contemporary poets of the early 20th century, showcasing the evolution of American and British verse during the modernist period. The anthology helped introduce readers to the &quot;new poetry&quot; movement and includes works that represented a departure from Victorian conventions toward more contemporary forms and themes.
</summarium>
    <notae>&quot;The Second Book of Modern Verse&quot; was first published in 1919 by Houghton Mifflin Company. This was Rittenhouse's follow-up to her enormously popular 1913 anthology &quot;The Little Book of Modern Verse.&quot; The 1919 date represents the original publication year of this specific anthology, which captured the state of modern poetry following World War I. As an anthology, this work compiles poems by various authors rather than being authored by Rittenhouse herself, though her editorial selection and arrangement represent significant curatorial work in shaping American poetry taste during this period.

The story follows young aviators in various aerial adventures, including combat missions, rescues, and ultimately an ambitious transatlantic flight. These books were part of a broader genre of series fiction for boys that emphasized courage, patriotism, and technological progress. Charles Amory Beach was a pseudonym used for this series, which was likely produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate or similar publisher of formulaic juvenile series books.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1920 is the original publication date shown on the title page. This timing is significant as it immediately follows WWI (ended 1918) and precedes Lindbergh's famous solo transatlantic flight by seven years (1927), though the first successful transatlantic flight was accomplished by Alcock and Brown in 1919. The book likely drew inspiration from real aviation achievements of the era while providing adventure fiction for young readers fascinated by the new technology of flight.

    <summarium>A firsthand military account by Colonel John Ward, C.B., C.M.G., M.P., of the British military expedition to Siberia during the Russian Civil War (1918-1920). Ward commanded battalions of the Middlesex Regiment (the 'Die-Hards') during the Allied intervention in Siberia following the Russian Revolution. The work documents military operations, political complexities, and the chaotic situation in Russia during this period. Originally written as a personal narrative for his sons in case he did not return, it provides valuable primary source material on the Allied intervention in Russia and the tumultuous post-WWI period in Siberia.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1920 is the publication year stated in the text itself. This is a contemporary account written shortly after the events described (the Siberian intervention of 1918-1920), making it a valuable primary historical source rather than a later historical analysis. The author explicitly notes in his forward that he wrote of events as they occurred and recorded motivations in real-time, which gives the work its documentary value despite what he acknowledges as limitations in historical perspective.

    <summarium>'The Three Taverns' is a collection of poems by Edwin Arlington Robinson, one of America's most distinguished early 20th-century poets. Robinson was known for his psychological depth, narrative skill, and exploration of New England characters and themes. This collection includes various poems dealing with historical, biblical, and contemporary subjects, including the title poem 'The Three Taverns' (referring to the biblical location where Paul met fellow Christians on his way to Rome), 'The Wandering Jew', and 'John Brown'. Robinson's work is characterized by its formal mastery, psychological insight, and often dark or ironic tone. He would go on to win three Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry (1922, 1925, 1928), though not for this particular volume.
</summarium>
    <notae>'The Three Taverns' was first published in 1920 by Macmillan. Robinson (1869-1935) was born in Maine and is considered a transitional figure between 19th-century romanticism and 20th-century modernism. The work is dedicated to Thomas Sergeant Perry (a scholar and critic) and his wife Lilla Cabot Perry (an accomplished painter and poet).

Murray (Vice-Principal of Maria Grey Training College and author of works on Froebel) and Henrietta Brown Smith (Lecturer in Education at University of London, Goldsmiths' College), the book focuses on the education and development of young children under the age of eight. The work reflects early 20th-century progressive education movements, particularly influenced by Froebelian pedagogy, which emphasized child-centered learning and natural development. The inclusion of a quote from Thomas Traherne, the 17th-century English poet and theologian, suggests a philosophical approach to understanding childhood consciousness and learning.

    <notae>The year 1920 is clearly stated on the title page and represents the original publication date. This work was part of a broader educational reform movement in early 20th-century Britain. The Maria Grey Training College was a significant institution for women's teacher training, and Goldsmiths' College remains a prestigious educational institution. The Froebelian influence mentioned (Friedrich Froebel founded the kindergarten movement) indicates this work bridges 19th-century educational philosophy with 20th-century practice.

    <summarium>Tales of Lonely Trails is a collection of adventure narratives by Zane Grey, the famous author of Western novels. This work represents Grey's non-fiction writings about his actual outdoor expeditions in the American West. The book includes accounts of his travels through remote wilderness areas including explorations of Nonnezoshe (Rainbow Bridge), Colorado trails, lion hunting expeditions in the Grand Canyon, adventures in the Tonto Basin, and Death Valley. Grey was an avid outdoorsman and conservationist, and these tales reflect his genuine experiences exploring some of the most isolated and spectacular landscapes of the American Southwest in the early 20th century. The work combines adventure narrative with nature writing and gives readers a glimpse into the wild frontier that was rapidly disappearing during Grey's lifetime.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 1922 is clearly indicated in the text itself and represents the original publication date of this collection. Zane Grey (1872-1939) was primarily known for his Western fiction novels, but he also wrote extensively about his real outdoor adventures. While Grey was not a Catholic author, these adventure tales are wholesome and appropriate for general audiences including children interested in nature and exploration.

    <summarium>This is a pioneering work in popular endocrinology by Dr. Louis Berman, who was an associate in biological chemistry at Columbia University. The book explores the relationship between the endocrine glands (glands of internal secretion) and human personality types. Berman examines how various glands—including the thyroid, pituitary, adrenals, gonads, and thymus—influence both physical characteristics and mental/personality traits. The work represents an early 20th century attempt to create a biological typology of human nature based on glandular function. The book covers the discovery of these glands, their physiological effects, their influence on sex differences, personality types, and speculates on applications to human evolution. While influential in its time, many of its conclusions would be considered outdated by modern endocrinology and psychology standards.
</summarium>
    <notae>Year 1922 is taken from the title page, which is the original publication date. This work was part of the early popularization of endocrinology in the 1920s, when understanding of hormones and glands was still developing. The book reflects the scientific optimism and biological determinism common in that era.

    <summarium>A study examining conditions among women in India during the early 20th century, written from a Christian missionary perspective. The book focuses on education and evangelization efforts among Indian women, particularly highlighting the contrast between Western-educated Christian women and traditional Hindu society. It emphasizes the role of missionary work and women's education as vehicles for social reform in India, reflecting the colonial-era missionary movement's attitudes toward indigenous religious practices and the perceived need for Christian conversion.
</summarium>
    <notae>The publication year of 1922 is clearly stated on the title page. This work represents the perspective of American Christian missionary organizations during the colonial period in India. The book was published by the Central Committee (likely a missionary organization) and reflects the era's missionary attitudes, including significant cultural bias against Hinduism and other Indian religious traditions. This is a historical document that provides insight into early 20th-century American missionary perspectives on India, though it should be read with awareness of its colonial-era viewpoint and religious prejudices.

beginners and intermediate skiers, drawing on her extensive experience \
coaching novices. The book contains practical advice on skiing technique, \

It contains first-person interviews with formerly enslaved people, preserving their oral histories and lived experiences of slavery in the United States. Volume VI specifically covers narratives from Kansas and includes interviews with Clayton Holbert, Bill Simms, and Belle Williams. These interviews represent invaluable primary source documents that provide direct testimony about the institution of slavery from those who experienced it, capturing details of daily life, family relationships, work conditions, and the transition to freedom. The collection was assembled by the Library of Congress and published in 1941.
</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 1941 as the year because that is when this compilation was officially published and assembled as a historical document by the Library of Congress. While the interviews were conducted between 1936-1938, the published work as a complete archival collection dates to 1941. This is a historical document that records oral histories, so the 1941 publication date marks its creation as a historical artifact rather than the events it describes (which occurred in the 19th century). The work is not marked as 'appropriate-for-children' as it contains frank descriptions of slavery that may be disturbing. It is not tagged as 'catholic' as it is a secular government historical documentation project, though individual informants may have had various religious backgrounds.

    <summarium>This is an audio recording by Roger McGuinn (founding member of The Byrds) performing the traditional American folk song &quot;Railroad Bill.&quot; The song tells the story of Railroad Bill, a legendary African American outlaw and folk hero from Alabama in the 1890s who evaded capture by hiding in railroad cars. McGuinn's version is part of his Folk Den project, where he recorded and shared traditional folk songs. This is a performance/interpretation of a traditional folk ballad rather than an original composition.
</summarium>
    <notae>The year 2001 reflects when McGuinn created this recording for Project Gutenberg. However, &quot;Railroad Bill&quot; itself is a traditional folk song dating back to the 1890s, chronicling the real-life exploits of Morris Slater (Railroad Bill), who was killed in 1896. The song has been recorded by numerous artists throughout the 20th century. McGuinn's folk revival interpretation represents a modern performance of this historical American folk tradition.

McGuinn, best known as the founder of The Byrds, created the Folk Den as an online repository of traditional folk music performances.</summarium>
    <notae>I chose 2003 because this is specifically a copyrighted modern recording by Roger McGuinn, not a historical text.

    <summarium>This is a collection of color photographs from the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, compiled by Bob Webster from NASA/JPL raw image data. The work involves combining images taken with different colored filters by the Mars rovers to create color photographs of the Martian surface. This is a documentation project making NASA's Mars exploration imagery more accessible to the public by processing the raw black and white filtered images into composite color photographs.

    <notae>Year chosen is 2004, which is when this eBook was released to Project Gutenberg (April 19, 2004). This coincides with the active mission period of both Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in January 2004. This is a contemporary compilation work rather than a historical text, so the publication year is the most appropriate date.
