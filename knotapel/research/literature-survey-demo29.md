# Academic Literature Survey: Forward DKC and Related Topics

*Compiled during Demo 29 (Forward DKC). February 2026.*

## Context

This survey targets literature relevant to the knotapel project's core idea: **forward DKC** — compiling exact Z[zeta_8] cyclotomic lattice points (Kauffman bracket values evaluated at roots of unity) directly into neural network weights to compute XOR without gradient-based training. The demos show a progression: bracket computation, reverse-engineering trained weights onto bracket lattices (demo 26), diagnosing error sources (demo 27), and comparing activations for phase preservation (demo 28).

## Topic 1: Cyclotomic Integers + Neural Networks / Machine Learning

**Finding: Very little direct work exists. This intersection is largely unexplored.**

The closest results fall into two separate buckets that do not touch each other:

### A. Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNNs)

**Paper 1: Arjovsky et al. (2016) — Unitary Evolution RNNs**
- Uses unitary weight matrices (eigenvalues on the unit circle, |lambda|=1) to solve vanishing/exploding gradients. Parameterizes unitaries as products of structured matrices (diagonal, reflection, permutation, FFT).
- No connection to cyclotomic integers or algebraic number theory.
- [arXiv:1511.06464](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06464)

**Paper 2: Jing et al. (2017) — Tunable Efficient Unitary Neural Networks (EUNN)**
- Builds on the same idea with tunable complexity.
- Uses rotations but never discrete/algebraic rotations. Always continuous parameterizations learned by gradient descent.
- [arXiv:1612.05231](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05231)

### B. Integer/Quantized Neural Networks

**Paper 3: GPTQ/Babai (2025) — The Lattice Geometry of Neural Network Quantization**
- Accepted at ICLR 2026. Proves that **GPTQ (a standard weight quantization algorithm) is equivalent to Babai's nearest-plane algorithm** for the closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice generated by input data.
- This is the closest anyone has come to connecting lattice geometry to NN weights, but it is about post-training quantization onto Z^n, not about algebraic integer lattices like Z[zeta_8].
- [arXiv:2508.01077](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01077)

**Connection to forward DKC:** Nobody has proposed using cyclotomic integer rings as weight spaces for neural networks. The GPTQ/Babai equivalence paper suggests the community is starting to notice that NN quantization IS a lattice problem, but they have not made the leap to non-standard lattices. Your project's use of Z[zeta_8] bracket values as exact weight lattice points appears genuinely novel.

## Topic 2: Lattice Codes + Computation

**Finding: Strong existing literature, particularly the Nazer-Gastpar compute-and-forward framework. Most directly relevant topic.**

### Paper 4: Nazer & Gastpar (2011) — Compute-and-Forward

- **Title:** "Compute-and-Forward: Harnessing Interference Rather Than Treating It as Noise"
- **Journal:** IEEE Trans. Info. Theory
- **Core idea:** In a wireless relay network, relays should compute *integer linear combinations* of codewords (not decode individual messages). Since lattice codewords are closed under integer linear combinations, lattice codes naturally support this.
- **Key finding:** Lattice codes enable relays to directly compute functions of transmitted signals, not just relay them.
- [arXiv:1107.0300](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.0300)

### Paper 5: Tunali, Huang, Boutros, Narayanan (2015) — Lattices over Eisenstein Integers

- **Title:** "Lattices over Eisenstein Integers for Compute-and-Forward"
- **Journal:** IEEE Trans. Info. Theory
- Extends Nazer-Gastpar to Z[omega] (Eisenstein integers, the ring of integers of Q(zeta_3)). Nested lattice codebooks over Eisenstein integers outperform codebooks over ordinary integers Z.
- **This is the closest existing work to forward DKC's spirit**: using algebraic integer lattices (not Z^n) to enable exact computation, with the algebraic structure doing the heavy lifting.
- [arXiv:1404.1312](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1312)

### Paper 6: Huang, Narayanan, Wang (2018) — Lattices Over Algebraic Integers

- **Title:** "Lattices Over Algebraic Integers With an Application to Compute-and-Forward"
- **Journal:** IEEE Trans. Info. Theory
- Generalizes further to rings of algebraic integers of imaginary quadratic fields. Proposes "adaptive compute-and-forward" that picks the best algebraic integer ring based on channel state.
- [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8387793/)

**Connection to forward DKC:** The compute-and-forward literature proves that algebraic integer lattices support exact function computation through their algebraic closure properties. Forward DKC proposes the same principle applied to neural networks: Z[zeta_8] lattice points as weights, with the algebraic structure ensuring exact bracket polynomial computation. The difference is that compute-and-forward is about computing linear functions at relays, while DKC is about computing nonlinear functions (XOR) through bracket evaluation. But the foundational insight — that algebraic integer rings enable computation through their ring structure, not through optimization — is shared.

## Topic 3: Kauffman Bracket + Exact Arithmetic / Cyclotomic

**Finding: Rich theoretical literature on bracket computation and cyclotomic expansions, but no one has connected this to exact arithmetic implementations over cyclotomic integer rings for the purpose of computation (as opposed to topology).**

### Paper 7: Habiro (2002) — Cyclotomic Expansion

- **Title:** "On the quantum sl_2 invariants of knots and integral homology spheres"
- **Journal:** Geometry & Topology Monographs
- Proved the cyclotomic expansion of colored Jones polynomials: the Jones polynomial can be expanded in a basis of cyclotomic polynomials with integer coefficients. This means Jones polynomial values at roots of unity live in cyclotomic integer rings.
- **This is a foundational result for forward DKC**: Habiro proved that bracket/Jones values at roots of unity are cyclotomic integers. The A = e^{i*5pi/4} evaluations landing in Z[zeta_8] is a specific instance of Habiro's integrality theorem.
- [arXiv:math/0209324](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0209324)

### Paper 8: Kuperberg (2015) — How Hard Is It to Approximate the Jones Polynomial?

- Exact evaluation of the Jones polynomial is #P-hard. Additive approximation at roots of unity is BQP-complete (Aharonov-Jones-Landau).
- **Implication for DKC**: exact bracket evaluation is exponential in crossing number (state-sum over 2^n states), so the catalog approach (enumerate all braids up to some size) is the right strategy for exact computation.
- [arXiv:0908.0512](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0512)

### Paper 9: Murakami (2021) — Cyclotomic Expansion Generalized

- **Title:** "Cyclotomic Expansion of Generalized Jones Polynomials"
- **Journal:** Letters in Math. Physics
- Extends Habiro's cyclotomic expansion to generalized Jones polynomials with three parameters. Proves integrality of the generalized invariants.
- [arXiv:1908.04415](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04415)

### Paper 10: Burton et al. — Efficient Computation of the Kauffman Bracket

- Exploits the local nature of the bracket for divide-and-conquer computation. Relevant to efficient catalog construction.
- [arXiv:1303.7179](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.7179)

**Connection to forward DKC:** Habiro's integrality theorem is the theoretical justification for why the approach works. The catalog of bracket values is a catalog of cyclotomic integers. The #P-hardness results mean the catalog must be precomputed (as we do), but once computed, the values are exact algebraic integers — no floating-point error.

## Topic 4: Forward Compilation + Topological + Neural

**Finding: Nothing exists that matches forward compilation of topological invariants into NN weights. Two adjacent areas found.**

### A. Weight Agnostic Neural Networks

**Paper 11: Gaier & Ha (2019) — Weight Agnostic Neural Networks**
- Searches for network *topologies* (architectures) that solve tasks *without training individual weights*. All connections share a single weight value.
- Key result: found minimal architectures that solve RL tasks and achieve above-chance MNIST accuracy with random weights.
- **This is the closest conceptual neighbor to forward DKC**, but approaches it from the opposite direction: WANNs search for the right topology assuming arbitrary weights, while DKC computes the right weights assuming a fixed topology. WANNs still use real-valued weights; DKC uses algebraic integer weights.
- [arXiv:1906.04358](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04358)

### B. Neural Networks for Knot Invariants (opposite direction)

**Paper 12: Hughes (2016) — NN Approach to Knot Invariants**
- Trains NNs to *predict* knot invariants from knot diagrams.
- [arXiv:1610.05744](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05744)

**Paper 13: Craven et al. (2023) — Geometric Learning of Knot Topology**
- Nature Communications.
- [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10732224/)

**Paper 14: Levitt (2025) — On the Learnability of Knot Invariants**
- Systematic study of which knot representations work best for ML prediction of invariants.
- [arXiv:2502.12243](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12243)

All of these train NNs on knot data to approximate invariants. None compile invariants *into* weights.

**Connection to forward DKC:** The existing literature uses NNs to approximate topological invariants (training on examples). Nobody has proposed the reverse: using topological invariants to construct NN weights that compute a target function. Forward DKC appears to be a genuinely novel direction with no direct precedent.

## Topic 5: Temperley-Lieb Algebra + Exact Representation / Integer Arithmetic

**Finding: Substantial mathematical literature on cyclotomic TL algebras, plus one key computational paper by Abramsky.**

### Paper 15: Rui & Xi (2004) — Cyclotomic TL Algebra Representation Theory

- **Title:** "The representation theory of cyclotomic Temperley-Lieb algebras"
- **Journal:** Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici
- Defines cyclotomic TL algebras via generators/relations. Proves they are cellular algebras. Gives criteria for semisimplicity in terms of whether generalized Chebyshev polynomials vanish on the defining parameters.
- **Key finding**: when delta is a root of unity, the TL algebra has a rich but finite representation theory characterized by vanishing conditions.
- [EMS Press](https://ems.press/journals/cmh/articles/440)

### Paper 16: Abramsky (2007) — TL Algebra: From Knot Theory to Logic and Computation

- **This is a landmark paper.** Gives a "fully abstract presentation" of the TL category using Geometry of Interaction, and introduces a **"planar lambda calculus"** interpreted in TL algebras.
- Shows that TL algebras are a natural setting for computation performed as geometric simplification of diagrams.
- **This is the strongest theoretical ancestor of forward DKC**: Abramsky proved that TL diagrams can encode computation. The step from "TL diagrams encode computation" to "bracket values of TL diagrams can be compiled into NN weights" is our contribution.
- [arXiv:0910.2737](https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2737)

### Paper 17: Rui (2005) — Semi-simplicity of Cyclotomic TL Algebras

- Necessary and sufficient conditions for semisimplicity over cyclotomic fields.
- [Project Euclid](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/michigan-mathematical-journal/volume-53/issue-1/On-the-semi-simplicity-of-cyclotomic-Temperley-Lieb-algebras/10.1307/mmj/1114021086.pdf)

**Connection to forward DKC:** When A = e^{i*5pi/4}, delta = 0, putting us in the most degenerate case of the cyclotomic TL algebra. Abramsky's work provides the theoretical bridge: TL = computation, and our bracket catalog is an enumeration of the computational primitives available in this specific TL algebra. At roots of unity, all TL algebra evaluations live in the corresponding cyclotomic integer ring — this is what makes exact arithmetic possible.

## Topic 6: Algebraic Number Theory + Error Correcting Codes

**Finding: Well-established field with direct relevance, especially codes over non-standard integer rings.**

### Paper 18: Oggier & Viterbo (2004) — Algebraic NT and Code Design

- **Title:** "Algebraic Number Theory and Code Design for Rayleigh Fading Channels"
- Systematic use of algebraic number fields (including cyclotomic fields) for constructing space-time codes.
- [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/18626413/Algebraic_Number_Theory_and_Code_Design_for_Rayleigh_Fading_Channels)

### Paper 19: Martinez et al. (2024) — Multilevel Lattice Codes from Hurwitz Quaternions

- Uses Hurwitz integers (quaternionic analog of Gaussian integers) for multilevel lattice codes. Important lattices (D4, E8, Leech lattice) have algebraic structure over Hurwitz integers.
- [arXiv:2401.10773](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.10773)

### Paper 20: Guzeltepe & Sarmasik (2024) — Codes over Eisenstein Integers

- Codes directly over Z[omega] with algebraic decoding algorithms.
- [arXiv:2412.18328](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.18328v1)

### Paper 21: Baldoni (2025) — Primitive Eisenstein Integers in Coding Theory

- Studies properties of Eisenstein integers specifically for coding applications.
- [MDPI Entropy](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/27/4/337)

### Paper 22: Ebeling (2013) — Lattices and Codes (Book)

- Textbook treatment of deep connections between lattices and codes.
- [Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-658-00360-9)

**Connection to forward DKC:** This literature proves that algebraic integer rings provide natural error-correcting structure for codes. The analogy to DKC is direct: projecting trained weights onto the nearest bracket value in Z[zeta_8] is the algebraic integer analog of lattice decoding.

## Summary Table

| Topic | Literature Exists? | Directly Relevant? | Territory Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Cyclotomic integers + NNs | Sparse (GPTQ/Babai 2025) | Adjacent but no direct overlap | **Unexplored** |
| 2. Lattice codes + computation | Rich (Nazer-Gastpar et al.) | Strong conceptual parallel | Established, but for communication not NNs |
| 3. Kauffman bracket + exact/cyclotomic | Rich (Habiro, Kuperberg) | Provides theoretical foundation | Established in topology, not applied to computation |
| 4. Forward compilation + topological + neural | Almost nothing (WANNs tangential) | No precedent found | **Unexplored** |
| 5. TL algebra + exact/cyclotomic | Moderate (Rui-Xi, Abramsky) | Abramsky's planar lambda calculus is ancestral | Bridge to computation made by Abramsky |
| 6. Algebraic NT + error-correcting codes | Rich and active | Lattice projection = lattice decoding | Established, useful framework |

## Key Takeaway

The most important finding is what does NOT exist: **nobody has proposed compiling topological invariants (bracket values) into neural network weights as an alternative to training.** The ingredients exist separately — Habiro proved bracket values are cyclotomic integers, Nazer-Gastpar proved algebraic integer lattices support function computation, Abramsky proved TL diagrams encode computation, and the GPTQ/Babai paper shows NN quantization is a lattice problem — but nobody has assembled these pieces into the forward DKC construction. Topics 1 and 4 represent genuinely unexplored territory.
