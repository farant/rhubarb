## P01: Radical Dimension Formula for TL at Roots of Unity

- **File**: `proofs/radical-dimension-formula.md`
- **Statement**: rad(TL_ℓ(2cos(π/ℓ))) = 2ℓ − 3 for all ℓ ≥ 2
- **Corollary**: rad(TL_{ℓ+1}(2cos(π/ℓ))) = ℓ² − ℓ − 3 for all ℓ ≥ 3
- **Method**: Graham-Lehrer cellular algebra theory. V_{ℓ-2} is the unique degenerate cell module at n=ℓ, with corank 1 via Chebyshev determinant (U_{ℓ-1}(cos(π/ℓ)) = 0). Radical contribution: 1·(2(ℓ-1)−1) = 2ℓ−3.
- **Status**: PROVEN
- **Previously**: VERIFIED computationally (Demos 51, 52, 60 — six data points ℓ=2..7)
- **Verification**: 23/23 cell module tests pass. Computational cross-check at all ℓ=2..7 including cubic field (ℓ=7).
- **Propagates to**: theorems.md (upgrade status), narrative.md (Section 7, Section 10 frontier), novelty.md (upgrade confidence), next-priorities.md (D65 status)
- **Related demos**: D51 (initial pattern discovery), D52 (multi-ℓ verification), D60 (cubic field confirmation), D39 Part G (cell module verification)
- **Open threads**: Nilpotency=3 from single-kernel structure? Fibonacci rank from kernel vector? ~~Markov trace radical = 2ℓ−2?~~ → ANSWERED by P03

## P02: Next-Level Radical Formula

- **File**: `proofs/next-level-radical-formula.md`
- **Statement**: rad(TL_{ℓ+1}(2cos(π/ℓ))) = ℓ² − ℓ − 3 for all ℓ ≥ 3
- **Corollary**: Universal Corank 1 — at the first n where any cell module V_j degenerates, its corank is always 1 (linked module is V_n^{(n)}, dim 1)
- **Method**: Graham-Lehrer linking theorem. At n=ℓ+1, V_{ℓ-3} is the unique degenerate cell module. Its linked module is V_{ℓ+1}^{(ℓ+1)} with dim 1, giving corank 1. Radical contribution: 1 · (2(ℓ-2) − 1) = 2ℓ − 5. Combined with V_{ℓ-2} (corank 1, contribution 2ℓ − 3 from P01 propagation), total rad = (2ℓ − 5) + (ℓ² − 3ℓ + 2) = ℓ² − ℓ − 3.
- **Status**: PROVEN
- **Previously**: VERIFIED computationally (Demo 39 Part H — five data points ℓ=3..7)
- **Verification**: Cross-checked at all ℓ=3..7.
- **Propagates to**: theorems.md (new entry, upgrade status), narrative.md, novelty.md
- **Related demos**: D39 Part H (computational verification), D51-52 (pattern discovery context)
- **Open threads**: Second-degeneracy corank = ℓ+1 at n=ℓ+2 — VERIFIED but not yet formally proven. No clean closed form for arbitrary n=ℓ+m.

## P03: Markov Trace and Reshetikhin-Turaev Truncation

- **File**: `proofs/markov-rt-truncation.md`
- **Statement**: For TL_n(2cos(π/ℓ)) with n ≥ ℓ ≥ 3, dim ker(B_M) = dim J(A) + Σ_{j ≥ ℓ-1, j ≡ n mod 2} (dim L_j)². The Markov trace kills exactly the simple blocks with j ≥ ℓ−1 and is nondegenerate on j ≤ ℓ−2.
- **Method**: Three-part proof: (A) Markov trace vanishes on negligible ideal I_ℓ (generated by JW_{ℓ-1}, since [ℓ]=0). (B) Negligible ideal kills exactly j ≥ ℓ−1 (through-strand count argument). (C) Excess formula from combining A and B.
- **Status**: PROVEN
- **Previously**: VERIFIED computationally (Demo 39 Parts I-J — 31 data points across n=ℓ..ℓ+3 for ℓ=3..7). Initial conjecture (ℓ+m−1)²+1 REFUTED at m=3, leading to correct block-sum formula.
- **Verification**: 31/31 numerical values match at n=ℓ through n=ℓ+3 for ℓ=3..7.
- **Propagates to**: theorems.md (new entry, upgrade status), narrative.md (Section 10 frontier), novelty.md (upgrade confidence), connections.md (three-light interpretation), next-priorities.md
- **Related demos**: D39 Parts G-J (discovery and verification), D63 (angular anatomy, uses RT truncation connection)
- **Corollaries**: (1) Markov rank = Σ_{j ≤ ℓ-2} (dim L_j)². (2) Shadow algebra TL_n/ker(B_M) ≅ ⊕_{j ≤ ℓ-2} M_{dim L_j} — the RT TQFT algebra. (3) The "shadow interpretation": fixpt = algebraic light (sees all simples), Markov = topological light (sees only RT-physical modules j ≤ ℓ-2). Excess = what topology cannot see.
- **Open threads**: Cross-sector kernel structure (coefficient matrix J−δI at ℓ=4 — does this generalize?). Composite shadows (intersection of two RT truncations). DKC interpretation of ℓ−2 threshold.

## P04: Parity-Lock Theorem

- **File**: `proofs/parity-lock-theorem.md`
- **Statement**: Under the ±q paired input encoding with k weights (2k input bits), the (0,0)≡(1,1) collision per weight creates 3^k equivalence classes. XOR/XNOR are the only standard Boolean functions constant on all classes. AND, OR, MAJ, and threshold functions are structurally impossible.
- **Method**: Direct computation of per-weight contributions under all 4 bit patterns. Equivalence class construction via effective state {-q, 0, +q}. Hamming parity preservation within classes. Sign-flip symmetry (S ↔ -S) as supplementary result.
- **Status**: PROVEN
- **Previously**: DEMONSTRATED computationally (Demo 92 — 0 winners for AND/OR/MAJ/THR2 at all depths 0-8, 76/76 collisions same-parity, 0/27 class conflicts for XOR)
- **Verification**: All 16 numerical tests in Demo 92 confirm theorem predictions. 13/13 sign-flip pairs verified identical.
- **Propagates to**: theorems.md (new entry), narrative.md (encoding constraint section), novelty.md (parity-lock as novel result), connections.md (link to D48/D50 encoding contrast)
- **Related demos**: D92 (discovery and verification), D89-D91 (depth law arc that motivated the investigation), D48/D50 (1-weight-per-input encoding computes all 13 NPN classes — contrast)
- **Corollaries**: (1) The depth law max_xor ≈ depth + 6 describes scaling for the ONLY achievable function family under ±q encoding. (2) Sign-flip symmetry collapses 3^k classes to at most (3^k+1)/2 distinguishable groups. (3) The ±q encoding concentrates all computational power on the highest-frequency Boolean function (parity), the one outside AC⁰.
