### D31 -- Execution-as-Traversal
- Run entity state vectors through braid matrix product for taxonomy classification
- Dependencies: D01-D04 (done)
- Priority: **LOW** -- same as D30; the DKC arc has moved far past this

- Dependencies: none
- Priority: **LOW** -- standalone geometric exploration

### D33 -- Full Pipeline (PD -> Braid -> Spin Chain -> Bracket)
- End-to-end composition of D01+D05+D08 into single pipeline

---

- Addresses: physical interpretation open question (narrative "what is next")

---

## Arc 4: Publication Strengthening (NEW -- from synthesis)

These directly address the strengthening actions and open questions identified in novelty.md Section 5 and the narrative frontier.

### D63 -- Angular Anatomy of DKC -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_63_angular_anatomy/**. 29/29 tests pass.
- 4-input parity at k=8 (96 solutions, tetraskelion). 5-input parity at k=15 (3020 solutions, pentaskelion).
- **Parity ceiling for Z[zeta_8] is n=5.** Triskelion generalization (k=2n) FALSIFIED.
- Oriented matroid classification: alternating OM type required for parity. 21 distinct types.
- Two types of impossibility: constraint wall (n=6,7) vs pigeonhole (n>=8).
- Universal k theorem: k=2M-1 for M-ray lattice (conjectured, proof sketch).
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_63.md for full results.

### D64 -- Catalog Completeness Bound -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_64_parity_matroid_recursion/**. 22/22 tests pass.
- Parity hierarchy {XOR2, XOR3, XOR4, XOR5} is a matroid minor chain: deletion gives XOR_{n-1}, contraction gives XNOR_{n-1} (100% closure, all levels). Funnel theorem: upward coverage collapses -- 99.3% -> 39.2% -> 19.2% -> 0% (XOR6). Vocabulary stratification: 44 good values / 31 poison values in the 83 class-1 catalog at k=15. Self-doubling impossibility theorem proven. Minimum wall distance d=4 (exhaustive). Exact Z[zeta_8] arithmetic required to eliminate floating-point boundary artifacts.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_64.md for full results.

### D65 -- Sandwich Theorem Formal Proof / Clifford Staircase -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_65_clifford_staircase/**. 38/38 tests pass.
- Z[zeta_16] catalog: 36 values, 14/16 angular directions. Parity ceiling n=5 is algebra-independent (identical thresholds at Z[zeta_8] and Z[zeta_16]). Gap-of-2 hypothesis refuted: pigeonhole bound rises from 7 to 14 but ceiling stays at 5 (gap widens to 9). XOR6 absolute wall confirmed at every k=2..31 for both catalogs. Generalized binary labeling breaks the wall at k=24 (3/2700 pass; antipodal pairs mandatory). XOR7 first solution at k=91; scaling ratio XOR7/XOR6 ~3.8. Zero margin universality: all passing solutions land exactly on Z[zeta_8] lattice directions.
- NOTE: Sandwich theorem proofs (radical dimension, next-level radical, Markov RT truncation) were also previously recorded here -- those are complete. Remaining algebra isomorphism and nilpotency proofs still open (Paper 3).
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_65.md for full results.

- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_75.md for full results.

---

## Arc 6: Scaling and Depth Arc (D76-D82)

These emerged naturally from the D72-D75 geometric arc and pushed the DKC system to higher input arities, discovering the activation wall, the zeta_12 breakthrough, and the crossing-depth law. All seven are now DONE.

### D76 -- Scaling DKC to 8 Inputs -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_76_scaling_8input/**. 10/10 tests pass.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_76.md for full results.

- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_77.md for full results.

- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_82.md for full results.

---

## Arc 7: Framing, Null States, and LCFT (D83-D84)

These emerged from the scaling/depth arc and the LCFT literature study. D83 discovered that framing (writhe) is an independent computational resource worth exactly +2 XOR levels, resolving the "N-2" mystery from D79. D84 proved that bracket-null entries (Re(q)=0) are computationally indispensable despite producing zero scalar output, connecting DKC to logarithmic conformal field theory. Both are DONE.

### D83 -- Framing as Computational Content -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_83_framing_test/**. 12/12 tests pass.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_83.md for full results.

### D84 -- Null States and Logarithmic Structure -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_84_null_states/**. 17/17 tests pass.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_84.md for full results.

---

## Arc 8: Non-Semisimplicity and Indecomposability (D85-D86)

These directly attacked the LCFT quantitative structure: computing the indecomposability parameter b from first principles, and testing whether it could be extracted from a single indecomposable module. D85 succeeded at TL_4; D86 established a novel negative result (divergence on single P_{0,0}).

### D85 -- Indecomposability Parameter b -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_85_indecomposability/**. 58/58 tests pass.
- b = -5/8 (Pearce-Rasmussen) confirmed at TL_4 via leading-coefficient extraction from delta-parameterized Markov trace on full regular representation. Literature controversy dissolved: b = -5/2 on regular rep / dim(0-TL sector) = 4 = -5/8 per cell. Valuation condition fails at TL_6 (diverges as delta^{-2}).
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_85.md for full results.

### D86 -- Direct b on Single P_{0,0} -- DONE (NEGATIVE RESULT)
- **Completed as demo_86_b_direct/**. 15/15 tests pass.
- Delta-parameterized Gram matrix approach universally diverges on single projective cover P_{0,0} at every eigenvalue and lattice size. Multiplicity from regular representation is structurally essential. Novel negative finding.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_86.md for full results.

---

## Arc 9: Mechanistic Arc -- Depth Law, Regime Transition, and Encoding (D87-D92)

These answered "why does DKC work and what are its structural limits?" D87 established regime-dependent null dispensability. D88 explained the anti-correlation mechanism. D89-D91 systematically identified and confirmed the depth law mechanism (axis cancellation + cross-depth algebraic constraints, balanced exponentials). D92 proved the parity-lock theorem: the +/-q encoding determines which functions are computable, more fundamental than activation or catalog.

### D87 -- Null Indispensability at zeta_12 -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_87_null_indispensability/**. 14/14 tests pass.
- Null indispensability is regime-dependent: at zeta_12 (infinite group), removing 121 nulls preserves full XOR6/8/10/12 capacity. Regime transition from zeta_8 where removing nulls destroys capacity. Direction density is the mechanism.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_87.md for full results.

### D88 -- Anti-Correlation Mechanism -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_88_anti_correlation/**. 8/8 tests pass.
- 13 zeta_8 directions form cuboctahedron: 4 non-null body diagonals are rigid computational anchors; 6 null-only edge midpoints are flexible scaffolding. K-ladder provides 14x better perturbation resilience than Voronoi-only (6.4% vs 89% loss). Constrained optimization (nulls free, non-nulls clamped 2 deg) captures 92% of design improvement with 2.8% XOR loss.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_88.md for full results.

### D89 -- Depth Law Mechanism -- DONE (PRELIMINARY)
- **Completed as demo_89_depth_law_mechanism/**. 14/14 tests pass.
- Tested 8 mechanistic hypotheses, killed 5 (pairwise coherence, direction coverage, Cayley density, sector diversity, angle coherence). Confirmed paired extension as real but minority (6-20% at zeta_12 vs 100% at zeta_8). Identified "algebraic coherence" as remaining open question.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_89.md for full results.

### D90 -- Sum-Angle Structure -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_90_sum_angle_structure/**. 10/12 tests pass (2 informative fails).
- Depth law mechanism is axis cancellation (anti-aligned rotation axes) + cross-depth algebraic constraints (BFS ancestry restricting sum-angle vocabularies). Advantage is RELATIONAL, not positional. S^2 point cloud bandwidth DECREASES with depth (spectral inversion).
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_90.md for full results.

### D91 -- Activation Bottleneck Test -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_91_activation_bottleneck/**. 6/7 tests pass (1 informative fail).
- Parity wall confirmed: max_xor is independent of activation resolution (k_sec 2-48 all give XOR8). Depth gap is k_sec-invariant. Balanced exponentials confirmed: BFS ~2x/round, parity 4x/weight, slope ~1.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_91.md for full results.

### D92 -- Function Scaling / Parity-Lock Theorem -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_92_function_scaling/**. 13/16 tests pass (3 informative fails confirming theorem).
- Parity-Lock Theorem PROVED: +/-q encoding structurally locked to XOR/XNOR. AND/OR/MAJ/THRESHOLD = 0 winners at ALL depths, ALL resolutions. Mechanism: masks 0...0 and 1...1 always produce identical sums (both zero). 3^k equivalence classes; XOR/XNOR are the only standard Boolean functions constant on all classes.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_92.md for full results.

---

## Arc 10: New Proposals from D85-D92 Open Questions and Vision Paths H/I/J

### 1wpi Encoding Depth Law (Path H from vision-alignment)
- Test whether the 1wpi encoding (D48/D50, which computes all 13 NPN classes) exhibits a depth law analogous to max_xor ~ depth+6. Specifically: does max_and or max_maj scale linearly with depth under 1wpi encoding? If so, the 1wpi encoding is the correct choice for the hybrid LLM vision (which needs AND/OR for syllogistic logic). If not, the compilation cost model for non-parity functions is completely open.
- This is THE most architecturally consequential open question for the compilation pipeline, identified by D92's parity-lock theorem. D92 proves +/-q is parity-locked; the 1wpi encoding is the only known alternative that computes non-parity functions; its scaling behavior is unknown.
- Dependencies: D48 (done), D50 (done), D82 (done, depth law infrastructure), D92 (done, parity-lock motivation)
- Priority: **HIGH** -- if 1wpi has no depth law, the entire compilation cost model for non-parity functions must be redesigned; if it does, the path to broadening DKC's function repertoire is clear

### Hybrid Encoding Design (Path H continuation)
- Design a mixed encoding where some weights use +/-q pairing (for depth-law parity scaling) and some use 1wpi (for non-parity function breadth). Test whether a hybrid achieves a richer set of Boolean functions while maintaining some depth-law structure for the parity components.
- D92 established that encoding is more fundamental than activation or catalog. The +/-q encoding concentrates on parity (the hardest function); the 1wpi encoding handles all 13 NPN classes. A hybrid might balance function breadth with depth-law scaling.
- Dependencies: 1wpi Depth Law demo (above), D92 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- depends on 1wpi depth law result; only meaningful if 1wpi shows different scaling characteristics than +/-q

### Balanced Exponentials Analytical Proof (Path I from vision-alignment)
- Derive analytically that the linear depth law slope ~1 follows from BFS branching factor ~2x/round vs parity demand growth 4x/weight. D91 confirmed this balance computationally across all activation resolutions. An analytical derivation connecting BFS branching factor to parity constraint growth rate would be a genuine theoretical result -- the next clean formal proof candidate after the parity-lock theorem.
- D90 provided the mechanistic explanation (axis cancellation + cross-depth constraints). D91 confirmed the wall is parity, not activation. The balanced exponentials explanation is consistent with all data but not derived from first principles.
- Dependencies: D90 (done), D91 (done)
- Priority: **HIGH** -- converts a demonstrated conjecture into a theorem; requires characterizing the BFS branching factor of the SU(2) generator construction and connecting it to the parity constraint combinatorics

### Null Dispensability Transition Location (Path J from vision-alignment)
- Locate the exact transition between null-indispensable (zeta_8) and null-dispensable (zeta_12) regimes. Test at intermediate catalog sizes: truncated zeta_12 catalogs at various depths, zeta_10 (Fibonacci anyons, infinite group). Is the control parameter a specific direction count, catalog size, null fraction, or per-direction spherical design residual?
- D87 established the regime transition exists. D88 showed per-direction residual is 8x lower at zeta_12 than zeta_8. The exact threshold is unknown. Knowing it gives a concrete design rule: below transition, preserve nulls; above, prune safely.
- Dependencies: D87 (done), D88 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- gives a concrete design threshold for the compilation pipeline; D88's per-direction residual metric is the leading candidate for the control parameter

### b Computation at Larger Lattice Sizes
- Identify and implement the actual Pearce-Rasmussen method for extracting b at lattice sizes beyond TL_4. D85 showed the delta-parameterized Gram matrix approach fails at TL_6 (valuation condition p_tt = 2*p_Tt not satisfied). D86 showed single P_{0,0} also diverges. The literature method likely uses transfer matrix + finite-size scaling, not the diagram-algebraic approach. Implementing their exact method would confirm b = -5/8 at larger sizes.
- D85 open questions: why does the valuation condition fail at TL_6? Can b be confirmed at TL_6 or TL_8? The spin chain approach (D85 Phase 4) at n=4,6,8 should be compared.
- Dependencies: D85 (done), D86 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- strengthens the b = -5/8 result beyond the single TL_4 confirmation; the literature method identification is a research question (may require consulting actual PR papers more carefully)

### Depth Law for Non-Parity Functions under 1wpi
- Does the linear depth law hold for ALL Boolean functions, or just parity? D91 and D92 together establish that the depth law is parity-specific under +/-q encoding. Under the 1wpi encoding (which can compute AND, OR, MAJ), does max_and or max_maj scale linearly with depth? Different functions have different constraint growth rates (MAJ has 19/27 class conflicts vs XOR's 0/27), so slopes might differ.
- D92 open question: "Can we construct encodings that target specific Boolean functions other than parity?" This demo would answer the scaling side of that question.
- Dependencies: 1wpi Depth Law demo (above), D92 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- only meaningful after the 1wpi depth law demo; if 1wpi has a depth law for AND/MAJ, the slope comparison would reveal how function complexity maps to catalog cost

---

## Continuing Proposals (carried forward, renumbered as needed)

The following proposals from previous arcs remain valid. Some have been partially addressed by D85-D92 results, noted below.

### Framing Loss at Other Roots (zeta_16, zeta_24)
- Test whether the +2 Jones normalization loss holds at zeta_16 and zeta_24 (and potentially zeta_6, zeta_10). D83 demonstrated the loss at zeta_8 and zeta_12 despite very different group sizes (24 vs 4096), suggesting universality. More roots needed to confirm.
- Originally proposed as D87 in Arc 8; actual D87 became "Null Indispensability." Proposal unchanged.
- Dependencies: D83 (done), D54 (done, Z[zeta_16]), D59 (done, Z[zeta_24])
- Priority: **HIGH** -- if the +2 loss is universal across all roots, the Resource Decomposition Conjecture becomes a theorem; if it varies, understanding why would be equally important

### zeta_32 Finiteness Test
- Test the Power-of-Two Finiteness Conjecture from D80: run a single `test_root(32)` call (theta = pi/16) to determine whether zeta_32 generates a finite SU(2) subgroup.
- D80 found only zeta_4 and zeta_8 finite of 7 tested roots and proposed that the finite cases are exactly angles pi/2^k (k >= 1). zeta_32 (k=4) is the next power-of-two case.
- Dependencies: D80 (done)
- Priority: **HIGH** -- single test_root(32) call; extremely low implementation cost, high payoff

### Analytical Proof of +2 Per Writhe Unit
- Prove analytically that the (-A^3)^{-w} Jones phase factor costs exactly 2 XOR levels. D83 demonstrated the result computationally at two roots.
- Originally proposed as D88 in Arc 8; actual D88 became "Anti-Correlation Mechanism." Proposal unchanged.
- Dependencies: D83 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- converts a demonstrated result into a proven theorem

### Jones-Sector Coincidence at zeta_8
- Test whether the Jones-normalized zeta_8 capacity (XOR6) is exactly the "standard 6-sector activation" capacity from D63. Would unify two independently discovered XOR6 regimes.
- Originally proposed as D89 in Arc 8; actual D89 became "Depth Law Mechanism." Proposal unchanged.
- Dependencies: D63 (done), D83 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- bridges sector-based and quaternionic DKC frameworks

### Exact Sector Classification for Cyc8
- Rewrite sector assignment using exact Z[zeta_8] integer arithmetic (Cyc8 representation) to eliminate all floating-point atan2 calls.
- Originally proposed as D83/D91 in earlier arcs; actual D91 became "Activation Bottleneck Test."
- Dependencies: D65 (done), D72 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- closes the last floating-point caveat in the generalized XOR6 result

### XOR10 at zeta_12 with Sec x Vor Activation
- Extend D77's combined Sec(k) x Voronoi activation to the zeta_12 system. Test whether XOR14 becomes reachable.
- Originally proposed as D84/D92 in earlier arcs; actual D92 became "Function Scaling / Parity-Lock Theorem."
- Dependencies: D77 (done), D79 (done), D81 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- tests whether the activation-determines-capacity theorem generalizes to infinite groups

### Explicit LCFT Jordan-Cell Pairs
- Construct explicit Jordan-cell pairs from the 3 shared-direction entries (coordinate axes) where both null and non-null entries coexist. Test whether these form a literal Jordan-cell pair in some representation of the braid group algebra.
- Originally proposed as D94. Unchanged.
- Dependencies: D84 (done), D35 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- converts D84's LCFT analogy into algebraic proof

### Dense Polymer Fusion on Lattice
- Implement lattice fusion for TL at beta=0 (dense polymer point, p=2, q=i, c=-2) and work out fusion rules explicitly. Gainutdinov et al. (2013) did this for percolation (p=3) but NOT for dense polymers (p=2).
- Originally proposed as D86 in Arc 8; actual D86 became "Direct b on Single P_{0,0}." Proposal unchanged.
- Dependencies: D35 (done), D84 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- fills a literature gap; D86's negative result (multiplicity essential) makes the fusion approach even more interesting as an alternative algebraic route

### Direct Deep-Entry Generation
- Investigate whether algebraic properties of depth-d quaternions can be characterized and sampled directly without computing all shallower depths via BFS closure.
- D82 showed deep entries are 2x more efficient. D90 now explains WHY (axis cancellation + cross-depth algebraic constraints). This mechanistic understanding makes the generation problem more precisely stated: target entries with anti-aligned axes relative to shallower entries and constrained sum-angle vocabularies.
- Dependencies: D82 (done), D90 (done, mechanistic understanding)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- would dramatically reduce computational cost of extending scaling law to XOR14+; D90's mechanism provides concrete target properties

### Optimal Depth Selection for Target XOR
- Determine whether pure depth-d subsets are optimal for a target XOR level or whether a mixed-depth subset achieves the same XOR level with fewer total entries.
- D89 Phase 11 showed paired extension (which combines entries across depths) is a minority pathway at zeta_12 (6-20% of winners). This suggests mixed-depth may help but is not dominant.
- Dependencies: D82 (done), D89 (done, paired extension data)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- refines practical catalog construction recipe

### Union Catalog zeta_8 + zeta_12
- Build a combined catalog merging the finite zeta_8 group (24 elements) with the zeta_12 group and test for superadditive XOR capacity. Union Catalog Conjecture from D79 remains open.
- Dependencies: D79 (done), D80 (done), D82 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- tests whether algebraic independence provides superadditive capacity

### zeta_10 Depth Analysis
- Apply the linear depth law analysis from D82 to zeta_10 to determine whether max_xor ~ depth + const holds with the same or a different constant.
- D80 showed zeta_10 has 71 distinct half-angles at 4096 entries. D89 tested the depth law mechanism only at zeta_12; zeta_10 is the Fibonacci anyon / universal quantum computation parameter.
- Dependencies: D80 (done), D81 (done), D82 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- determines whether scaling constant is universal or root-dependent

### zeta_10 Null Fraction and Directional Role
- Measure the null entry count, null fraction, and directional role of null entries at zeta_10. Fills in the dilution curve between zeta_8 (37.5%) and zeta_12 (3.0%).
- D87 established the dispensability transition; zeta_10 sits between the two tested roots.
- Dependencies: D80 (done), D84 (done), D87 (done)
- Priority: **LOW** -- characterization at the universal quantum computation root; also helps locate the dispensability transition (see "Null Dispensability Transition Location" above)

### Writhe Distribution of 24-Cell Vertices
- Characterize the writhe distribution of the 24 entries forming the binary octahedral group. Test whether antipodal pairs have opposite writhes.
- Originally proposed as D90 in Arc 8; actual D90 became "Sum-Angle Structure."
- Dependencies: D83 (done), D74 (done)
- Priority: **LOW** -- structural characterization

### Depth-3 -> 100% Null Generalization
- Test whether the maximum-depth stratum of any finite SU(2) subgroup consists entirely of bracket-null entries.
- Dependencies: D80 (done), D84 (done)
- Priority: **LOW** -- small scope (only zeta_4 to test unless zeta_32 is finite)

### RC Exactification with Null-State Geometry
- Use the quaternionic DKC framework to design reservoir weight matrices where null-state geometry is explicitly controlled.
- D87's regime-dependent finding refines this: the RC null-state interpretation applies only in sparse-direction (finite group) regimes.
- Dependencies: D84 (done), D82 (done), D87 (done, regime refinement)
- Priority: **LOW** -- speculative but high-impact if successful

## Arc 11b: Multi-Strand Scaling/Diagnostics and Raqiya Graph Analysis (D102-D109)

The D102-D105 arc characterized multi-strand DKC scaling, decisively refuting radical-as-resource (D102), establishing BFS growth as a braid group invariant (D103), discovering the Atkinson sweet spot and branching decomposition (D104), and scaling to 8-strand while refuting "XOR dies at N>=7" (D105). The D106-D109 arc shifted to predicting computational capability: topological entropy is orthogonal (D106), axis-alignment is a provable theorem (D107), graph structure predicts parity (D108), and the dual-channel polarity inverts with encoding (D109). All eight are DONE.

### D102 -- 6-Strand Radical A/B Test -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_102_6strand_ab/**. 84 pass, 2 structural fails.
- Barrington-Radical Principle: radical carries abelian writhe character, provably useless for parity. Simple W_{6,0} beats non-simple W_{6,4} at every XOR level. sl_5 growth rate (~5x) confirmed as 4th data point.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_102.md for full results.

### D103 -- Pure Dimension Scaling Test -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_103_dimension_scaling/**. 76 pass, 2 structural fails.
- BFS growth is a braid group invariant: W_{6,0} (dim=5) and W_{6,2} (dim=9) produce IDENTICAL BFS trees. Higher dimension hurts XOR via curse of dimensionality in sign-hash. B@sub7 beats A@full.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_103.md for full results.

### D104 -- Activation Coarseness Sweep -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_104_coarseness_sweep/**. 35/35 pass.
- Atkinson sweet spot at ~120 of 324 components. Cross-block branching interaction is the computational signal. Sign-rank EXPANSION (244->292). k is the real lever, not hash architecture.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_104.md for full results.

- **Completed as demo_105_8strand_k_regime/**. 96/96 pass.
- D93's "XOR dies at N>=7" REFUTED as k-regime artifact. W_{8,0} XOR8=22266 at k=4096. Macrame principle: branching regime transition at n=8. Rank saturation confound discovered.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_105.md for full results.

### D106 -- Topological Entropy -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_106_topological_entropy/**. 20/20 pass.
- Pre-registered prediction FALSIFIED: topological entropy is completely orthogonal to DKC computation. TL visibility filter explains why: properties erased by TL quotient (entropy) are invisible to DKC.
- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_106.md for full results.

### D107 -- Algebraic Graph Density -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_107_algebraic_graph/**. 42/42 pass.

- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_107.md for full results.

### D108 -- Parity Vocabulary Graph Analysis -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_108_parity_vocabulary/**. 3/3 pass.

- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_108.md for full results.

### D109 -- D55 Value Set Graph Analysis -- DONE
- **Completed as demo_109_d55_graph_analysis/**. 5/5 pass.

- See atlas/inventory/entries/demo_109.md for full results.

## Arc 12: New Proposals from D95-D101 Open Questions

### 6-Strand W_{6,4} Decisive Test -- PARTIALLY RESOLVED by D102
- D102 tested W_{6,4} head-to-head against W_{6,0}: sl_5 growth (~5x) CONFIRMED. But W_{6,4} has ZERO XOR10 winners (no super-hubs testable) and simple W_{6,0} WINS at every XOR level. The radical carries abelian writhe character (Barrington-Radical Principle). The question is now RESOLVED: non-semisimplicity provides only modest (+8%) mixing-row advantage at XOR6, not deep capacity. The remaining question from D101's falsified hub-count prediction is now understood: hubs are absent because 6-strand has flat frequency distributions, not because of semisimplicity.
- Dependencies: D100 (done), D101 (done), D102 (done)
- Priority: ~~**HIGH**~~ **RESOLVED** by D102

### Radical Content XOR Correlation Study
- D100 showed radical content is CONSTANT across all depths (mean=2) and does NOT distinguish XOR winners from non-winners (14 vs 14). But hub commutators have zero radical content -- they annihilate the radical direction. Is this a general theorem (commutators of braid matrices on W_{n,k} always annihilate the radical) or specific to these hub entries? Systematic test: compute radical content of commutators across all entry pairs, not just hubs.
- Dependencies: D100 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- if general, establishes radical-annihilating commutators as a structural theorem for non-semisimple TL modules

### Activation Zoo for Multi-Strand DKC -- PARTIALLY ADDRESSED by D103-D105
- D103-D105 systematically investigated sign-hash activation design: D104 discovered the Atkinson sweet spot (~120 optimal components), branching cross-block decomposition, and sign-rank expansion. D105 found the macrame principle (branching regime transition at n=8). These provide principled design tools for multi-strand activation. However, the core question remains: can a principled activation (analogous to Sec x Vor k-ladder for quaternions) recover XOR14 on W_{5,3}? The branching decomposition from D104 provides a concrete framework for this. Also: k (cell count) is the real lever, not hash architecture (D104 Phase 7).
- Dependencies: D99 (done), D100 (done), D101 (done), D103-D105 (done, activation theory)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- D104's cross-block recipe and D105's macrame principle provide concrete starting points; the remaining gap is designing activations that respect module structure beyond sign-hash

### Fibonacci Direct Test at q=exp(2pi*i/5)
- Test DKC capacity directly at the Fibonacci parameter q = exp(2*pi*i/5) on the Delta_1 module. The Fibonacci parameter yields [2]_q = phi^{-1} ~ 0.618 (non-vanishing quantum dimension). At this parameter, does the 2x2 Delta_1 module give different computational characteristics than at q = zeta_8 (where delta=0, quantum dimension vanishes)? If non-vanishing quantum dimension avoids the Jordan block structure, this directly tests whether non-semisimplicity (Ext^1) is essential for the high-XOR algebraic regime.
- Dependencies: D99 (done), D94 (done, Fibonacci context)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- bridges the finite 2I group and the Fibonacci anyon parameter through the multi-strand lens

### Artificial Perfect Cell Construction
- D97 showed Cell B's 100% XOR perfection comes from 3 mutually orthogonal directions at any half-angle in a 50-degree plateau. Can we construct "perfect cells" for arbitrary groups by choosing orthogonal directions at angles in this plateau? Does the orthonormal-frame recipe generalize to 2I (31 directions, 9 half-angles)? For multi-strand matrices: is there an analog of orthogonal-frame perfection in the Mat2/Mat3/Mat4 activation spaces?
- Dependencies: D97 (done), D96 (done, catalog pruning principle)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- if successful, provides a constructive recipe for optimal DKC catalogs from first principles

### Non-Semisimple TQFT DKC Formalization
- D99's Ext^1 catalytic preparation thesis mirrors the structure of non-semisimple TQFT (Voss-Kim-Bhatt 2025): alpha-anyon anchor (quantum trace zero) + sigma-anyon qubits + semisimple readout. D100 confirms: non-semisimple W_{4,2} achieves XOR14=70 while simple W_{5,3} achieves XOR14=0. Formalize this connection: is there a functor from the non-semisimple TQFT category to the DKC computation category that maps alpha-anyons to super-hubs and sigma-anyons to satellites?
- Dependencies: D99 (done), D100 (done), D101 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- if successful, connects DKC to the cutting edge of non-semisimple TQFT; high publication value

---

## Arc 13: New Proposals from D102-D109 Open Questions

### Fibonacci Max-Abs Radical Constraint
- D102 showed W_{6,4} max coefficient magnitude follows strict Fibonacci (1,1,2,3,5,8,13) through depth 6, while W_{6,0} breaks at d=6 (16 instead of 13). Does the radical act as a constraint that keeps coefficients on the Fibonacci sequence? If so, this is another manifestation of the radical carrying structured (abelian) information. Test at W_{8,2} and other non-simple modules.
- Dependencies: D102 (done)
- Priority: **LOW** -- interesting structural characterization; follows from the writhe character constraining coefficient growth

### Universal BFS Tree Conjecture Verification
- D102 and D103 together show all THREE n=6 modules (W_{6,0}, W_{6,2}, W_{6,4}) produce identical BFS trees. Does this hold for ALL simple TL_n modules at delta=0 for every n? Testing at n=8 (D105 has W_{8,0} and W_{8,2}) and at n=10 would strengthen the "BFS growth is a braid group invariant" from a demonstrated pattern to a near-certain conjecture.
- Dependencies: D102 (done), D103 (done), D105 (done)
- Priority: **LOW** -- structural result; practical implication is that module choice affects readout only, not the reservoir

### Macrame Principle Crossover Location
- D104 showed cross-block branching dominates at n=6 (asymmetric blocks dim 5+4). D105 showed within-block dominates at n=8 (symmetric blocks dim 14+14). Where is the exact crossover? W_{6,4} or W_{10,2} could bracket it. The crossover likely depends on block complexity: simple blocks need connections (edges), complex blocks are self-sufficient (nodes).
- Dependencies: D104 (done), D105 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- gives a design rule for multi-strand activation: when to use cross-block vs within-block components

### W_{8,2} Rank Saturation and Head-to-Head
- D105 showed W_{8,2} rank was severely under-sampled (34.9% at 16384 entries, still growing). Sign expansion at 1.83x and climbing. Head-to-head W_{8,0} vs W_{8,2} XOR comparison at matched k and oversampling has NOT been performed. Need ~130K entries for comparable oversampling. Would settle whether dim-28 algebraic information provides advantage at sufficient activation resolution.
- Dependencies: D105 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- unresolved empirical question from D105; requires larger BFS cap or smarter sampling

### Sign-Rank Expansion Theory
- D104 showed sign quantization EXPANDS effective rank (W_{6,2}: raw 244 -> sign 292, gain of 48 independent directions). D105 showed W_{8,2} expansion at 1.83x and still growing. What determines whether sign quantization expands or preserves rank? Is it related to module dimension, non-semisimplicity, or Z-linear dependencies being "nearly independent" in sign space? A theory would enable principled activation engineering.
- Dependencies: D104 (done), D105 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- would provide a foundational principle for multi-strand activation design

### TL Visibility Filter Completeness
- D106 proved topological entropy is invisible to DKC because the TL quotient erases it (e_i^2=0 kills expanding eigenvalues). Is the TL visibility filter the COMPLETE characterization of what DKC can "see"? Specifically: is the TL quotient (writhe-visible, entropy-invisible) the EXACT boundary, or are there other properties invisible to the TL quotient that we haven't tested?
- Dependencies: D106 (done), D83 (done, writhe visible)
- Priority: **LOW** -- would strengthen the theoretical foundation but requires identifying candidate properties to test

### TL Visibility at Delta != 0
- D106's TL visibility filter is sharp at delta=0 where e_i^2=0. At delta!=0, e_i^2=delta*e_i != 0, meaning the TL quotient is less destructive. Do dynamical properties (entropy, spectral radius) become visible to DKC at delta!=0? Would test at delta=sqrt(2) using the W_{4,2} dual-representation infrastructure from D106.
- Dependencies: D106 (done), D109 (done, delta=sqrt(2) infrastructure)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- if entropy correlates with DKC at delta!=0, the TL visibility filter becomes a delta-dependent design parameter

### Value Set Convergence at Depth > 8
- D107 found 186 distinct Z[zeta_8] values from 32768-entry catalog, with 72 new values at depth 8 (still growing fast). Does the value set converge? Need deeper catalogs beyond the 32768 cap. Relates to whether the parity/poison vocabulary partition is complete or whether new deep values could change the classification.
- Dependencies: D107 (done)
- Priority: **LOW** -- characterization question; increasing the BFS cap is straightforward

### Major Index Theorem for General W_{n,j}
- D107 verified maj mod 2 = bipartite coloring at W_{4,2} (3/3) and W_{6,2} (9/9, uniquely winning among 4 candidates). Proof for general n,j is open. Need verification at W_{8,2}, W_{6,4}, W_{10,2} for more evidence. The major index invariant appears to be a genuinely novel algebraic invariant of TL link states (confirmed by researcher as NOT a consequence of known KLR grading).
- Dependencies: D107 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- novel algebraic result; verification at more modules is low-cost, proof would be high publication value (conjecture-graph Rank 8: C41)

### 2-Adic Neutrality Formal Proof
- D107 observed geometric decay in v_2 distribution (95->48->24->11->7, approx halving per level). Five candidate proof frameworks identified (Kummer carry-counting, nilpotent TL, Goodman-Wenzl, unipotent, Stirling). Need to select one and formalize.
- Dependencies: D107 (done)
- Priority: **LOW** -- interesting number-theoretic connection but not on the critical path

### Additive Encoding at Delta=sqrt(2)
- D109 showed product closure polarity inverts between additive (D108) and multiplicative (D109) encodings. The cleanest confirmation of encoding-dependence would be: hold delta=sqrt(2) constant and switch to additive encoding. If D108-style discrimination (parity = HIGH product closure) returns, encoding-dependence is confirmed by a single controlled experiment.
- Dependencies: D108 (done), D109 (done)
- Priority: **HIGH** -- single controlled experiment confirms the encoding-dependent dual-channel theorem; low implementation cost (reuse D109 catalog, change encoding)

### Quantitative Product-Closure Threshold
- D108 showed parity requires product closure > 0 (17 edges vs 0 for poison). D109 showed parity has lower product closure than non-parity at delta=sqrt(2) (14.8% vs 46.6%). At what product closure density does the additive-to-multiplicative transition occur? Is there a sharp threshold or gradual crossover? Would test by interpolating between the two encoding regimes.
- Dependencies: D108 (done), D109 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- would make the dual-channel theorem quantitatively predictive, not just qualitatively discriminative

### Raqiya Z[zeta_16] Extension
- D109 used ad-hoc Z[zeta_16] graph analysis. If more delta!=0 investigation is planned, building full Raqiya support for Z[zeta_16] (8-component cyclotomic ring, Gaussian axial decomposition) would enable systematic algebraic diagnostics at all evaluation levels. The ZiAxis decomposition from D109 provides the starting architecture.
- Dependencies: D109 (done), Raqiya library (operational)
- Priority: **LOW** -- infrastructure investment; only worthwhile if delta!=0 investigation continues

---

## Priority Summary

### HIGH (do these first -- direct publication impact or architecturally consequential)
1. **RKHS Kernel Rank Test (D95)** — from D94. Compute DKC kernel K(m,m') = quaternion inner product of sums for 2I vs z8. If rank(K_2I)/rank(K_z8) > 120/24, non-solvability contributes above raw catalog size. One number confirms or refutes the "discrete algebraic reservoir computer" interpretation. Single demo, extremely high leverage — validates the five-pillar synthesis.
2. **1wpi Encoding Depth Law** (Path H). THE most consequential open question from D92: does the non-parity encoding scale? **D93 context:** D93 confirms all 13 NPN classes under phase_cell at N=3, and demonstrates circuit complexity hierarchy under 1wpi. Depth-law test under 1wpi/phase_cell is the next step.
3. **Balanced Exponentials Analytical Proof** (Path I). Next formal proof candidate after parity-lock theorem. Conjecture-graph Rank 2 (C23).
4. **Framing Loss at Other Roots** (zeta_16, zeta_24). Confirms or refines +2 universality from D83.
5. **zeta_32 Finiteness Test**. Single test, extremely low cost, high payoff.
6. **D65 (remaining)** -- Sandwich Theorem: algebra isomorphism and nilpotency=3 still needed for Paper 3.
7. **Higher k_sec with 2I** — from D94. Does k_sec=24 push the N=8 XOR cliff further for 2I? The 384-cell space (k=12, 31 directions) may not fully exploit 2I's angular richness (9 half-angles). Quick test, high information content.
8. ~~**6-Strand W_{6,4} Decisive Test**~~ — **RESOLVED by D102**. Barrington-Radical Principle: simple wins, radical is abelian writhe character. See Arc 12.
9. **Additive Encoding at Delta=sqrt(2)** — NEW from D109. Single controlled experiment confirms encoding-dependent dual-channel theorem. Holds delta constant, changes encoding. Low cost, high payoff — directly validates the polarity inversion discovered in D108-D109.
10. **Amy Bridge Formalization** — Conjecture-graph Rank 5 (C51). Map DKC dual-channel (D108) onto T-gate/Hadamard decomposition in Amy-Glaudell-Ross 2023. D108-D109 provide the empirical foundation; formalization would connect DKC to quantum circuit synthesis resource theory.

### MEDIUM (do next -- strengthen claims or open new connections)
6. **Null Dispensability Transition Location** (Path J). Locates the regime boundary for compilation design rules.
7. **Hybrid Encoding Design** (Path H continuation). Depends on 1wpi depth law result.
8. **b Computation at Larger Lattice Sizes**. Strengthens b = -5/8 beyond TL_4.
9. **Depth Law for Non-Parity Functions under 1wpi**. Depends on 1wpi depth law result.
10. **Analytical Proof of +2 Per Writhe Unit**. Converts D83 demonstration into theorem.

14. **Explicit LCFT Jordan-Cell Pairs**. Makes D84 LCFT connection algebraically precise.
15. **Dense Polymer Fusion on Lattice**. Fills literature gap; alternative algebraic route after D86's negative result.
16. **Direct Deep-Entry Generation**. Enables XOR14+; D90 provides concrete target properties.
17. **Optimal Depth Selection**. Refines catalog construction recipe.
18. **Union Catalog zeta_8 + zeta_12**. Tests Union Catalog Conjecture.
19. **zeta_10 Depth Analysis**. Tests universality of scaling constant.
20. **D44** -- Path Integral / Ising. Physics interpretation.
21. **D36** -- Long Braid Scaling. Practical ceiling validation.
22. **Radical Content XOR Correlation Study** — from D100. Are radical-annihilating commutators a general theorem for non-semisimple TL modules?
23. **Activation Zoo for Multi-Strand DKC** — from D99-D101, partially addressed by D103-D105. See Arc 12 updated entry.
24. **Fibonacci Direct Test at q=exp(2pi*i/5)** — from D99/D94. Does non-vanishing quantum dimension avoid Jordan blocks?
25. **Artificial Perfect Cell Construction** — from D97. Orthonormal-frame recipe for constructing optimal catalogs from first principles.
26. **Non-Semisimple TQFT DKC Formalization** — from D99-D101. Functor from non-semisimple TQFT category to DKC computation.
27. **Macrame Principle Crossover Location** — NEW from D104-D105. Where between block dim 5 and dim 14 does branching interaction regime transition? W_{10,2} could bracket it.
28. **W_{8,2} Rank Saturation and Head-to-Head** — NEW from D105. Unresolved empirical question: does dim-28 provide advantage at sufficient activation resolution? Needs ~130K entries.
29. **Sign-Rank Expansion Theory** — NEW from D104-D105. What determines whether sign quantization expands rank? Would enable principled activation engineering.
30. **Major Index Theorem for General W_{n,j}** — NEW from D107. Novel algebraic invariant; verification at W_{8,2}, W_{6,4} is low-cost. Proof is high publication value (conjecture-graph Rank 8).
31. **TL Visibility at Delta != 0** — NEW from D106. Do dynamical properties become visible to DKC when e_i^2 != 0? Test at delta=sqrt(2).
32. **Quantitative Product-Closure Threshold** — NEW from D108-D109. Makes dual-channel theorem quantitatively predictive by identifying the transition density.

### RKHS Kernel Rank Test (D95) — NEW (D94)
- Compute the DKC kernel matrix K(m,m') = quaternion inner product of signed sums for 2I (60 entries) vs z8 (24 entries). Rank of kernel matrix predicts reservoir separation capacity. If rank(K_2I)/rank(K_z8) > 120/24 = 5, then non-solvability contributes above raw catalog size — confirming the "discrete algebraic reservoir computer" interpretation from D94.
- Testable prediction from D94's reservoir computing mapping: fixed catalog = reservoir, Cayley graph = connectivity, signed sum = linear readout, activation = nonlinear output.
- Dependencies: D94 (done), D93 (done, 1wpi/phase_cell framework)
- Priority: **HIGH** -- single computation, one number, confirms or refutes an entire theoretical pillar. The five-pillar synthesis (TL-as-computation, Barrington, Nazer-Gastpar, MVN, reservoir computing) is complete in D94; this tests its central quantitative prediction.

### Higher k_sec with 2I — NEW (D94)
- At k_sec=24 instead of k_sec=12, the cell count roughly doubles (768 vs 384). Test whether N=8 XOR becomes nonzero for 2I. 2I has 9 conjugacy classes / half-angles and 31 distinct S2 directions — the angular richness may not be fully exploited at k=12.
- Dependencies: D94 (done)
- Priority: **HIGH** -- quick parameter sweep, tests whether 2I's capacity is activation-limited

### Quantum Dimension Direct Test at Fibonacci Parameter — NEW (D94)
- Test DKC capacity directly at the Fibonacci parameter q = e^{2*pi*i/5} rather than through the 2I finite group. The Fibonacci parameter yields [2]_q = phi^{-1} ~ 0.618 (non-vanishing, non-degenerate) — uniquely "maximally computational" for TQC. How does a dense catalog at this parameter compare to 2I's finite catalog?
- Dependencies: D94 (done), D80 (done, Fibonacci anyon context from zeta_10)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- bridges the finite 2I group and its infinite dense counterpart

### Cross-Depth 2I Analysis — NEW (D94)
- Do deeper 2I entries (BFS depth d=5-7) contribute more than shallow ones to XOR capacity? 2I's BFS depth profile is symmetric (5,8,11,12,11,8,4,1). Does the contribution profile mirror this symmetry, or are deeper entries disproportionately valuable as they are for zeta_12 (D82)?
- Dependencies: D94 (done), D82 (done, depth law context)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- tests whether the depth law mechanism applies to non-solvable finite groups

### Size vs Solvability Disentangling — NEW (D94)
- Phase 2 controls for size (24 vs 24) and Phase 4 shows crossover, but 2I has 60 entries vs z12's 51 in the three-way comparison. A sharper test: 2I truncated to exactly 51 entries vs z12 at 51 entries. Removes the last confound in the solvability bottleneck demonstration.
- Dependencies: D94 (done)
- Priority: **MEDIUM** -- strengthens the solvability bottleneck claim for publication

### LOW (backlog -- valid but not urgent)
33. **zeta_10 Null Fraction**. Characterization + transition location data.
34. **Writhe Distribution of 24-Cell Vertices**. Structural characterization.

47. **Universal BFS Tree Conjecture Verification** — NEW from D102-D103. Test at n=8, n=10.
48. **TL Visibility Filter Completeness** — NEW from D106. Is the TL quotient the exact boundary of what DKC can see?
49. **Value Set Convergence at Depth > 8** — NEW from D107. Do the 186 values converge?
50. **2-Adic Neutrality Formal Proof** — NEW from D107. Five proof frameworks identified; select and formalize.
51. **Raqiya Z[zeta_16] Extension** — NEW from D109. Full Raqiya support for 8-component cyclotomic ring. Only if delta!=0 investigation continues.

## Open Questions Not Yet Assigned to Demos

These emerged from synthesis but don't have a clear single-demo scope yet:

- **Multi-layer DKC**: cascading bracket-valued neurons for circuit-level compilation (narrative Section 10). Needs design work before scoping.
- **Galois symmetry conjecture**: sandwich duality from Galois automorphisms of Gal(Q(zeta_8)/Q). Highly speculative; may resolve itself during remaining D65 work.
- **Abramsky depth**: full Geometry of Interaction interpretation to predict which bracket triples compute which functions. Needs significant theoretical development.
- **Costello-Francis-Gwilliam connection**: Witten=RT now proven (2026); DKC compiles QFT transition amplitudes into Boolean logic. Framing question more than a demo. NOTE: D83's framing result adds a new angle -- the "framing anomaly" that TQFT discards is exactly where DKC's +2 capacity lives.
- **OM generalization**: what OM type characterizes n-input parity for n=4,5? (D64 established 21 distinct oriented matroid types; characterization of which types are required is open.)
- **n=6 constraint wall proof**: clean algebraic proof, or inherently finite-verification? (D64 proven d=4 minimum wall distance exhaustively; triple-interaction weight-3+ obstruction not yet characterized.)
- **Hopf base vs eigenvector geometry**: why does Hopf base S^2 (292 solutions at 64 cells) beat eigenvector lat/lon (204) at high resolution? Geometric relationship between the two S^2 parameterizations is not yet understood.
- **k=38 gap**: why is k=38 the only even k>=24 with zero generalized XOR6 solutions? Is 19 special with respect to the Z[zeta_8] lattice?
- **Even/odd k pattern**: generalized XOR6 solutions exist at even k near threshold, not odd k. Provable from pi/4 lattice alignment?
- **Bloch sphere / quantum information**: the computation lives on S^2=CP^1 (the Bloch sphere) at angular mode l=6 (hexadecapole). Is there a quantum-information interpretation?
- **Funnel rate formula**: upward coverage fractions 99.3% -> 39.2% -> 19.2% -> 0% -- algebraic or exponential decay as a function of n? (D64 open conjecture.)
- **Poison octant 4**: D64 showed 31 poison values span octants {1,2,3,5,6,7} but never octant 4. Geometric explanation unknown.
- **Quadrupole symmetry in zeta_8 directions**: D72 found l=2 mode vanishes to machine precision (|S_{2,m}|=5.11e-16) despite t=0 overall. What algebraic identity ensures sum Y_{2,m}(dir_i)=0 for the binary octahedral eigenvector directions?
- **Perturbation non-monotonicity**: D72 found small perturbations (1 deg) slightly increase mean XOR6 count (38 > 36). Can the maximum XOR6 solution count for any 13-point configuration on S^2 be characterized? Is 36 a local or global maximum?
- **Exact 27-state automaton**: D73 found signed 27-cell partition reaches 87.1% determinism, not 100%. Is there a different 27-partition of S^2 that achieves 100% determinism, or does 100% require tracking magnitude information?
- **[*,18,22] dead zone in D74**: triples containing q18 and q22 (edge-type) separate zero bracket collisions. Is this a geometric accident or a group-theoretic obstruction?
- **8-family partition of winning triples (D75)**: can the partition of 36 XOR6 winners into 8 groups based on angle function be explained algebraically from 24-cell geometry?
- **Why do XOR8 winners use only canonical angles?**: D77 found winning quadruples use only 45 deg and 90 deg half-angles (canonical octahedral) while additive sums introduce non-canonical angles. Group-theoretic explanation unknown.
- **Polar 14x6 ceiling**: D77 found Polar 14x6 activation reaches 99.2% accuracy (one misclassified pair from perfection). Is 100% achievable with different magnitude binning, or is there a fundamental obstruction at 84 cells?
- **16 misclassified masks at XOR10 (D78)**: best accuracy leaves 16 masks wrong at 98.4%. Do these form a structured pattern?
- **Information-theoretic lower bound on max_N**: is there a clean formula relating the maximum computable N to catalog size, direction count, and angle count?
- **Does zeta_12 truly generate an infinite group or a very large finite group?**: D79 observed roughly doubling growth over 8 rounds but did not run to closure. Concrete group theory question with implications for the finite-vs-infinite capacity dichotomy.
- **E_6 and E_8 reachability**: binary tetrahedral (order 24, E_6) and binary icosahedral (order 120, E_8) are not reached by the two-perpendicular-axes generator construction. Is there a different natural generator construction that reaches them?
- **Why do perpendicular pi/3 rotations not close?**: D80 identified the geometric intuition (hexagonal vs. octahedral symmetry) but a rigorous algebraic proof of why exactly pi/2 and pi/4 are the special finite angles has not been given.
- **Is scaling truly O(log N) or O(log N / log log N)?**: D81's decreasing transition gap series (3.35 -> 2.43 -> 2.05 doublings) needs at least one more data point (XOR14 transition at ~38K entries) to distinguish these hypotheses.
- **Does the 0.62 scaling constant depend on the root of unity?**: D81 conjectured the constant is a function of angular density per closure round. zeta_10 (71 angles at 4096 entries) vs zeta_12 (43 angles) is the natural comparison.
- **What algebraic property does strided-564 lack?**: D82 showed strided-564 has full vocabulary (512 dirs, 43 angles) but cannot reach XOR12 while deep-564 can. D90 answered this: the missing property is relational (axis anti-alignment, cross-depth algebraic constraints), not positional. But formalizing this algebraically remains open.
- **Depth law for other roots**: D82 demonstrated max_xor ~ depth + 6 for zeta_12. Does the constant 6 shift for zeta_10 or zeta_16? Comparison not yet run.
- **Knot complexity and computational power**: D82 interpreted depth as crossing depth. Does a more complexly knotted strand compute more than many simply knotted strands with equal or greater total vocabulary? Connection to known results about torus knots vs. hyperbolic knots unexplored.
- **Three-level discarding pattern** (from D83-D84): (1) Jones normalizes away writhe -> loses 2 XOR levels. (2) Bracket trace projects onto Re(q) -> loses 6/13 directions. (3) LCFT null states treated as trivial -> loses logarithmic partners. Each level of "simplification" in the literature discards computational content. Is there a fourth level?
- **Does writhe add exactly +2 regardless of depth?** (from D83): D83 shows framing=+2 at the group's maximum capacity. At intermediate depths, does bracket also beat Jones by exactly 2, or does the gap vary with depth?
- **Null entries and knot complexity** (from D84): bracket-null entries are maximally deep (depth-3 in zeta_8). Do depth-d null entries correspond to specific knot types whose Jones polynomial vanishes at delta=0?
- **Non-semisimplicity thesis** (from explorer's log): semisimple = Markov chain (memoryless), non-semisimple = counter machine (nilpotent Jordan blocks accumulate depth history). The radical provides BOTH null entries AND the memory mechanism. The slope in the capacity formula comes from Loewy length / radical depth. Needs formalization.
- **Depth-level framing gap measurement** (from D83): at each individual depth level d, what is the bracket-vs-Jones capacity gap? If it is always exactly 2, the resource decomposition is truly additive. If it varies, depth and framing interact.
- **Why does the valuation condition fail at TL_6?** (NEW from D85): p_tt = 4, p_Tt = 3 (gap = -2) at TL_6. Cross-copy interference from 25-fold multiplicity does not rescue the balance. Is there a modified extraction that works for larger sizes?
- **TL_8 P_{0,0} is completely semisimple** (NEW from D86): no Jordan blocks at lambda=0 on the dim-42 ideal. Is there a periodicity or parity pattern in the non-semisimple structure across TL sizes?
- **Are the 67 null-only directions at zeta_12 ever needed?** (NEW from D87): at XOR14/XOR16, could null-only directions become essential again? Current search stops at XOR12.
- **zeta_12 load-bearing directions** (NEW from D88): at zeta_12 with 2043 directions, is there ANY subset that is computationally load-bearing (analogous to the 4 body-diagonal anchors at zeta_8)?
- **Constrained optimization as SDP** (NEW from D88): can the constrained optimization approach (flexible nulls + rigid non-nulls) be formulated as a semidefinite program rather than simulated annealing?
- **Golden ratio eigenvalue pairs** (NEW from D88): phi and -phi+1 in the Gram spectrum -- do these appear at other roots, or are they specific to zeta_8's octahedral geometry?
- **Can axis cancellation be exploited for weight selection?** (NEW from D90): if the mechanism is anti-aligned axis pairs, can we directly select weight tuples by maximizing anti-alignment rather than brute-force XOR testing?
- **Relational activation** (NEW from D90): could an activation function that explicitly uses axis dot products between entries break the linear depth law? Current activations treat entries independently.
- **Why slope = 1 analytically?** (NEW from D90/D91): the balanced-exponentials argument is consistent with data but not derived from first principles. See "Balanced Exponentials Analytical Proof" proposal above.
- **Does the depth law depend on BFS catalog construction?** (NEW from D91): alternative constructions (random quaternion sampling, algebraically structured non-BFS) might have different growth rates, yielding different depth law slopes.
- **Encoding optimality** (NEW from D92): is the +/-q encoding provably optimal for parity among all 2-bit-per-weight encodings?
- **Phase-sensitive activation** (NEW from D92): the sign-flip symmetry (combined_cell(S) = combined_cell(-S)) is a second parity-lock mechanism. Can a phase-sensitive activation that distinguishes S from -S break the parity lock while preserving depth-law structure?
- **MAJ conflict count (19/27)** (NEW from D92): MAJ has the most class conflicts of any tested function. Is this related to MAJ's computational complexity (MAJ is TC^0-complete)?
- **Why does W_{6,0} break Fibonacci at d=6?** (NEW from D102): W_{6,4} max_abs follows strict Fibonacci (13) but W_{6,0} reaches 16 at d=6. Does the radical constraint keep coefficients on Fibonacci? Another manifestation of abelian writhe structure?
- **Mixing row scaling** (NEW from D102): B_full (2370) > B_quotient (2195) at XOR6, an 8% boost. Is this boost consistent across strand counts, and does it scale? The mixing row encodes quotient-to-radical leakage.
- **Why does B@sub7 beat A@full?** (NEW from D103): B@sub7 (196 sign components from dim-9) achieves XOR6=2538, beating A@full (100 from dim-5) at 2449. The 7x7 subblock of the 9x9 representation contains algebraic information that the 5x5 does not have. What IS this information?
- **Strided sampling decorrelation** (NEW from D103): B@stride3 (~108 components, every 3rd entry) gets XOR8=767, beating both B@full (557) and approaching A@full (850). Is there an optimal stride or sampling pattern?
- **Information concentration in early components** (NEW from D104): Sequential first-100 (2360) beats random mean (2266) with high spread (262). Which specific components carry the most signal? Can a component importance ranking identify algebraically meaningful dimensions?
- **Atkinson peak k-dependence** (NEW from D104): At k=128, optimal is 120 comp. Does the peak shift to more components at higher k? Sign-rank of 292 suggests more could be exploited.
- **Branching advantage vs k regime** (NEW from D104): Cross-block advantage dramatic at k=128 (XOR8: 952 vs 557) but disappears by k=4096. Is there a k threshold formula relating module dimension, rank, and crossover point?
- **W_{8,2} true saturated rank** (NEW from D105): At 16384 entries / 3136 cols = 5.2x oversampling, W_{8,2} is at 34.9% raw rank. Would need ~130K entries for comparable oversampling. What is the true saturated rank fraction?
- **Does sign expansion ratio vs module structure follow a law?** (NEW from D105): W_{8,2} shows 1.83x at 16384 entries (still growing). W_{6,2} shows 1.20x. W_{8,0} shows 1.08x. What controls expansion?
- **Does the entropy null extend to higher strand counts?** (NEW from D106): D106 uses W_{4,2} (4-strand). Expected yes since TL visibility filter argument is representation-independent, but untested.
- **Can entropy predict anything about catalog properties?** (NEW from D106): Total null for Boolean function computation. But could entropy correlate with hub frequency, co-occurrence topology, or Raqiya graph structure?
- **Does the 186-value set close?** (NEW from D107): 72 new values at depth 8 (still growing fast). Need deeper catalogs (>32768).
- **zeta_12 axis-alignment prediction** (NEW from D107, registered before computation): At delta=sqrt(3) != 0, expect mostly axis-aligned but with occasional mixing proportional to |delta|.
- **q-ballot evaluations at other roots** (NEW from D107): Does q-Catalan have clean evaluation at roots beyond q=-1?
- **Dual-channel prediction for XOR6** (NEW from D108): Can dual-channel analysis predict which custom sector labelings at k>=24 achieve XOR6? Extends D65.
- **Z[i] product closure at delta=sqrt(2)** (NEW from D108): Does the Z[i] lattice have intrinsically better product closure than Z[zeta_8]? Would explain D55's 9334-solution explosion.
- **Parity-lock as dual-channel constraint** (NEW from D108): Is D92's parity-lock precisely the statement that +-q encoding constrains to exactly one dual-channel configuration?
- **Non-monotonic solution count prediction** (NEW from D108): Does dual-channel structure predict 906@k=6 > 756@k=7 > 96@k=8?
- **50% vocabulary as structural constant** (NEW from D109): Is the 28/28 = 50% split at delta=sqrt(2) an artifact of Re>0 activation, or does every activation give exactly 50%? If universal, reflects a deeper algebraic automorphism.
- **Angular discriminator for Z[zeta_16] parity** (NEW from D109): What distinguishes 28 parity from 28 non-parity if not algebraic structure? Is it purely angular position relative to Re>0?
- **j=0 liveness implies structural universality** (NEW from D109): At delta=0, j=0 dead implies impoverished algebra. At delta!=0, j=0 alive implies structural universality. Is this a general principle?
