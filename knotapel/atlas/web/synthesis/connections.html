    <h1>Cross-Demo Connections</h1>
<p>How 109 demos feed into each other, what recurs, and where threads unexpectedly converge.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>1. Dependency Graph: The Five Arcs</h2>
<h3>Foundation Arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">D01</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_09.html">D09</a>)</h3>
Linear chain building the bracket computation pipeline:
<p><code></code>` <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">D01</a> (state-sum oracle) --&gt; <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_02.html">D02</a> (braid bracket) --&gt; <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_03.html">D03</a> (TL module)      |                          |                       |      v                          v                       v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_07.html">D07</a> (braid-&gt;PD bridge)    <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_04.html">D04</a> (spin chain)         <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_06.html">D06</a> (Jones-Wenzl)      |                          |      v                          v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_08.html">D08</a> (PD-&gt;braid Vogel)     <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_05.html">D05</a> (scaling n=2..5)      |      v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_09.html">D09</a> (Reidemeister invariance) <code></code>`</p>
<p>Every later demo traces back to <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">D01</a>'s <code>Poly</code> type and state-sum oracle. The chain has a clear pedagogical structure: compute the bracket (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">D01</a>), represent it algebraically (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_02.html">D02</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_06.html">D06</a>), bridge representations (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_07.html">D07</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_08.html">D08</a>), prove invariance (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_09.html">D09</a>).</p>
<h3>Classification Arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_10.html">D10</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_17.html">D17</a>)</h3>
Numerical pivot and the "what can we do with this" exploration:

The central research arc, split into two phases:
<p><strong>Phase 1 — Reverse DKC (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_26.html">D26</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>):</strong> <code></code>` <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_26.html">D26</a> (reverse: real weights)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_27.html">D27</a> (reverse: complex weights, U(1) gauge)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_28.html">D28</a> (activation comparison: modReLU, cardioid)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a> (FORWARD DKC: exact Z[zeta_8], XOR triples) &lt;-- LANDMARK <code></code>`</p>

<h3>Proof Arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_61.html">D61</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_62.html">D62</a>)</h3>
The final theoretical resolution:

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_62.html">D62</a> closes the investigation: the wall is geometric (parallelogram gap on circle), not algebraic. Zero floating-point in the proof.</p>
<h3>Quaternionic Arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">D64</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>)</h3>
Matroid anatomy, Clifford hierarchy, and quaternionic lift:

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">D64</a> reveals the parity hierarchy as a matroid minor chain and proves the n=6 wall geometrically (self-doubling impossibility). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a> tests the Clifford hierarchy conjecture from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">D64</a>: standard Z[zeta_16] leaves the ceiling unchanged (REFUTED for standard activations), but generalized binary labelings break it at k=24 (CONFIRMED for generalized). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a> lifts the bracket from S¹ to S³, discovers the 24-cell as the natural braid geometry, and explains the k=24 threshold as a projection of its 24 vertices. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a> proves S² (rotation axis) is the computational sweet spot and that the Hopf fiber phase is completely inert. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_68.html">D68</a> proves the computation is intrinsically curved and cannot be flattened to R². <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">D69</a> proves universal direction nesting (ζ_8 ⊂ ζ_16 ⊂ ζ_32 exactly on S²) and explains trivialization at finer roots. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_70.html">D70</a> maps the algebraic structure to music and confirms Hopf orthogonality. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a> closes with a degrees-of-freedom proof: minimum bandwidth l=6 because 2×6+1=13 equals the eigenvector direction count.</p>
<h3>Spherical Design and Automaton Arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a>)</h3>
Algebraic optimality, automaton structure, invariant theory, and binocular channels:
<p><code></code>` <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a> (DOF argument: 13 directions, l=6 bandwidth)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a> (spherical design test: t=0 design, anti-correlation between geometry and computation)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> (eigenvector automaton: DKC is additive not multiplicative, 82.8% universal determinism)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">D74</a> (computational invariant: bracket vs cell incomparable, 119 combined classes)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a> (binocular DKC: angle subsumes cell for sums, 2.3× capacity, √n magnitudes) <code></code>`</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a> shows that the 13 directions achieve the worst possible geometric distribution (t=0) yet 2.6× better-distributed directions give 9× fewer solutions (4 vs 36). The algebraic placement is sharp to ~5° (Voronoi cell boundary). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> establishes that DKC is fundamentally additive: the multiplicative braid product cannot compute XOR6 (complement- all-bits maps M to M⁻¹, which shares the same eigenvector cell). Additive 82.8% determinism is a universal constant across all 36 winning triples. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">D74</a> proves the bracket and Voronoi cell are incomparable invariants (neither refines the other), with the combined (bracket, cell) pair giving 119 classes vs 100 bracket-alone. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a> discovers that at the sum level, the eigenvalue angle subsumes the cell entirely (angle perfectly predicts parity for all 36 winners), giving 2.3× capacity over cell-only, while the multiplicative channel (which stays inside the 24-cell group) has zero XOR6 solutions.</p>
<h3>Scaling and Finiteness Arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">D76</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>)</h3>
The wall-was-activation pattern recurs, group finiteness governs capacity, and framing
and null states reveal two additional independent computational resources:
<p><code></code>` <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a> (binocular DKC, 6-input complete)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">D76</a> (scaling to 8 inputs: 0 winners under S² Voronoi) &lt;-- WALL  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">D77</a> (activation zoo: XOR8 solved at S¹×S² activation, 6 winners) &lt;-- RESOLUTION  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">D78</a> (recursive scaling: XOR10 = 0 at ζ₈, wall confirmed exhaustively) &lt;-- WALL  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> (ζ₁₂ capacity: XOR10 = 124 winners, XOR12 = 50+) &lt;-- RESOLUTION  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a> (group finiteness: only ζ₄ and ζ₈ finite; ζ₁₂ infinite = no hard ceiling)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">D81</a> (scaling law: max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog) + 4.6 for ζ₁₂)  |  v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> (crossing depth law: max_xor ≈ depth + 6; log law is corollary of depth law)  |        \  v         v <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a>        <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> (framing:  (null states: Jones→     bracket-null bracket    entries maintain -2 XOR,    XOR8 via S² writhe as  directional +2 axis)   vocab) <code></code>`</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">D76</a> confirms zero XOR8 solutions at ζ₈ with S²-only activation (pigeonhole: 256 masks / 14 cells ≈ 18.3 per cell). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">D77</a> resolves this by adding the S¹ (eigenvalue angle) channel: S¹×S² product activation with 112 cells gives 6 XOR8 winners. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">D78</a> then exhaustively confirms XOR10 = 0 at ζ₈ under all activation functions tested — the ζ₈ XOR hierarchy terminates at 8 inputs because the binary octahedral group has only 24 elements and the catalog's combinatorial diversity is exhausted at 5-element selection. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> breaks this wall by switching to ζ₁₂, whose group is infinite (or very large): 124 XOR10 winners, 50+ XOR12 winners. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a> surveys 7 roots and finds only ζ₄ and ζ₈ generate finite SU(2) subgroups; all others (including ζ₁₂) are infinite. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">D81</a> measures the logarithmic scaling law for ζ₁₂. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> reinterprets it: depth (group-closure birth round = number of generator multiplications = crossing number) is the fundamental variable, and the logarithmic law is a corollary of the linear depth law plus the exponential catalog growth per round.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> branches from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> by asking whether the bracket-to-Jones normalization step costs computational capacity: yes, exactly 2 XOR levels at every root tested (ζ₁₂: bracket XOR12 → Jones XOR10; ζ₈: bracket XOR8 → Jones XOR6). The "N-2 pattern" first observed in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> is resolved — it was Jones capacity all along, not a bracket truncation artifact. Writhe (braid chirality, independent of depth at r = 0.14) is a third independent computational axis, contributing +2 XOR levels identical in magnitude to one depth unit. The TQFT framing anomaly that physicists normalize away is precisely the term DKC uses for computation.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> branches from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> on the same ζ₈ catalog to examine why bracket-null entries (Re(q) = 0, trace vanishes) do not impair XOR8 capacity. They do not impair it — they enable it. The 9 null entries cover 6 S² directions (cube-edge midpoints) absent from all 15 non-null entries; removing nulls drops capacity from XOR8 to XOR6, below even the random-removal baseline of 7.8. Depth and nullness are correlated (depth-3 stratum = 100% null) but the mechanism is directional: null entries are maximally directionally efficient (1.00 dir/entry vs. 0.47 for non-null). Cross-root comparison shows null fraction decreases sharply as the group grows (ζ₄=75%, ζ₈=37.5%, ζ₁₂=3%), consistent with nulls being a finite-group boundary effect that LCFT Jordan-cell structure illuminates.</p>
<h3>Non-Semisimplicity and Depth Law Arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>)</h3>
Two interleaved chains investigating the algebraic anatomy (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">D87</a>) and the
depth law mechanism (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_89.html">D89</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>), with <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">D88</a> bridging the two:

<p>Each ring carries the same API surface: zero/one/add/mul/eq/to_cx/print. The TL matrix engine sits on top, parameterized by ring. Swapping the coefficient ring is the only change between <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_53.html">D53</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_54.html">D54</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_58.html">D58</a>, and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_59.html">D59</a>. The quaternionic arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>+) introduces a genuinely different algebra — unit quaternions as SU(2) braid representations — complementary to the cyclotomic scalar bracket.</p>
<h3>The Two Oracles</h3>
<p>Every new computation method is validated against one of two oracles:</p>
<p>1. <strong>State-sum oracle</strong> (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">D01</a>): brute-force 2^n enumeration, ground truth for brackets.    Used to validate the matrix method (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_03.html">D03</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_06.html">D06</a>), numerical engine (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_10.html">D10</a>), TL matrix    method (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_35.html">D35</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_53.html">D53</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_59.html">D59</a>).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Forward DKC catalog</strong> (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>): exact Z[zeta_8] bracket values, ground truth for    Boolean function reachability. Used to validate trained network decomposition    (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_45.html">D45</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_47.html">D47</a>) and activation function analysis (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>).</p>
<h3>Copy-Paste Pattern</h3>
<p>There is no shared library extraction. Each demo is standalone <code><a href="../demo_78_recursive_scaling/main.c.html">main.c</a></code>. This means: <ul> <li>Bug fixes don't propagate (MAX_TERMS varies: 64 in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">D01</a>, 120 in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_04.html">D04</a>+)</li> <li>Each demo compiles independently (a feature, not a bug)</li> <li>The "library" is pattern knowledge, not shared object files</li> <li>Ring-parametric code (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_53.html">D53</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_59.html">D59</a>) is the closest to a true abstraction</li> </ul>
<p>---</p>
<h2>3. Recurring Themes</h2>
<h3>Exact vs Approximate Arithmetic</h3>
<p>This tension runs through the entire project. The symbolic polynomial ring (<code>Poly</code>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">D01</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_09.html">D09</a>) is exact but expensive. The numerical engine (<code>Cx</code>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_10.html">D10</a>+) is cheap but approximate. The cyclotomic rings (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>+) are exact AND efficient for specific evaluation points.</p>
<p>Key moments: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a> shows exact Z[zeta_8] arithmetic makes forward DKC possible. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a>'s 100M-quartet exhaustive search depends on exact equality testing. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_61.html">D61</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_62.html">D62</a>'s proofs use pure integer arithmetic with zero floating-point.</p>
<p>The pattern: approximate methods discover phenomena, exact methods prove them.</p>
<h3>Non-Semisimplicity as Both Obstacle and Resource</h3>
<p>At delta=0, TL generators are nilpotent (e_i^2 = 0). This makes the algebra non-semisimple for even n (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_51.html">D51</a>), which:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As obstacle</strong>: The radical kills degrees of freedom needed for parity (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_47.html">D47</a> conjecture, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a> confirmation). Bracket evaluation factors through the semisimple quotient TL/rad, losing radical information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>As resource</strong>: Nilpotency at delta=0 means only single-loop states survive, enabling the delta=0 simplification (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>) that makes exact computation feasible. The very constraint that blocks parity is what enables exact DKC for 12/13 classes.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_49.html">D49</a> tests whether radical elements (neglectons) can break the parity wall. They cannot --- the perturbation approach is closed. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a> resolves this by changing the activation function instead of the weight space.</p>
<h3>The Activation Function as the Key Variable</h3>
<p>The project converges on activation geometry as the determining factor for computational capability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split-sigmoid (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_27.html">D27</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_45.html">D45</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a>): sees magnitudes, destroys phase. 12/13 NPN classes via forward DKC, parity impossible.</li>
<li>MVN-continuous (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_47.html">D47</a>): sees phases, different correlation structure. Complementary to split-sigmoid.</li>
<li>k-sector (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>): parity reachable at k=6 with 906 solutions from the same catalog that split-sigmoid searched 100M times finding zero.</li>
<li>Re&gt;0 half-plane (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_55.html">D55</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_58.html">D58</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_59.html">D59</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_61.html">D61</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_62.html">D62</a>): 11/13 universal across all ell values. Wall proven geometrically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lattice is fixed; the activation chooses which subset of its structure to access.</p>
<h3>Topology -&gt; Algebra -&gt; Computation Pipeline</h3>
<p>The project's central pipeline:</p>
<p><code></code>` Knot/braid topology  --&gt;  TL algebra / bracket values  --&gt;  Boolean computation      (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">D01</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_09.html">D09</a>)              (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_35.html">D35</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_51.html">D51</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_52.html">D52</a>)              (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_18.html">D18</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_25.html">D25</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_45.html">D45</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>) <code></code>`</p>
<p>Each arrow is non-trivial. The first collapses the infinite braid group to a finite-dimensional TL algebra (compression ratios measured in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_22.html">D22</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_35.html">D35</a>). The second maps cyclotomic integers to truth tables via activation-mediated classification.</p>
<h3>Angular Structure and Its Geometric Meaning</h3>
<p>Bracket values at delta=0 are axial: they lie on 8 rays in the complex plane (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_35.html">D35</a> axiality theorem). At delta=sqrt(2), values are Z[i]-axial: 2D subspace of the 8D ring (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_54.html">D54</a>). At delta=phi, full 4D usage (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_58.html">D58</a>).</p>
<p>This angular structure determines computational capability: <ul> <li>The 8 axes of Z[zeta_8] create a discrete angular alphabet</li> <li>k-sector activation reads this alphabet directly (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>)</li> <li>Half-plane activation projects it to a binary partition (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_61.html">D61</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_62.html">D62</a>)</li> <li>The parity function requires 3 odd sectors at 120-degree spacing (triskelion principle, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>) which is incommensurable with the pi/4 lattice at k=2</li> </ul>
<h3>Dimensional Projection and the S² Sweet Spot</h3>
<p>The quaternionic arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>) establishes a hierarchy of projections:</p>
<p><code></code>` SU(2) / S³ (full quaternion)  --&gt;  S² (rotation axis / Hopf base)      <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>: 35 solutions               <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>: 36 solutions (more, fewer cells)          |                                |          v                                v      S¹ (complex trace)             R² (stereographic)      <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a>: 25 cells needed           <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_68.html">D68</a>: visualization only, not workspace <code></code>`</p>
<p>The counter-intuitive result: projecting DOWN increases computational efficiency. The full S³ geometry is redundant; the Hopf fiber phase (S¹) is completely inert (r = -0.06 with spatial direction, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>/<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_70.html">D70</a>). The computation is entirely determined by the rotation axis on S². Moreover, R² is insufficient — the computation is intrinsically curved (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_68.html">D68</a>: Euclidean metric gives zero solutions, S² metric gives 36).</p>
<p>The 13-direction S² Voronoi is data-derived, not Platonic: octahedral (6 cells), icosahedral (12 cells), cuboctahedral (12 cells), dodecahedral (10 cells) all give zero XOR6 solutions (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_70.html">D70</a>). The natural polyhedral symmetries are wrong; only the braid-intrinsic 13 eigenvector directions work.</p>
<h3>The 13-Direction Structure and Its Rigidity</h3>
<p>The binary octahedral group produces exactly 13 distinct rotation-axis directions (mod ±) from the 24 SU(2) quaternions. This 13 is not arbitrary: <ul> <li>It matches the minimum sectors needed for XOR6 on S¹ after projection (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a> k=24 connected to <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a> 24-cell vertex count → <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a> 13-direction Voronoi)</li> <li>2×6+1=13, so l=6 spherical harmonics are exactly sufficient to address them (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>, the 13=13 theorem)</li> <li>All 13 directions nest exactly into ζ_16 and ζ_32 catalogs (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">D69</a> direction nesting theorem), with ζ_8 the coarsest root producing this structure</li> </ul>
<p>Finer cyclotomic roots produce thousands of additional directions, causing pigeonhole trivialization (~90% XOR6 rate at ζ_16) — the 13-direction structure is the computational optimum, not a stepping stone.</p>
<h3>Music-Space Orthogonality</h3>
<p>The quaternionic structure separates into two orthogonal dimensions (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_70.html">D70</a>): <ul> <li><strong>Eigenvalue angle θ</strong> (trace): maps to pitch. Four values → four notes (C, Eb, E, F#), spanning unison to tritone. Yang-Baxter equivalent braids produce identical melodies step by step.</li> <li><strong>Eigenvector direction</strong> (rotation axis): maps to space. 13 distinct directions determine all DKC computational information.</li> </ul>
<p>Pearson r = -0.06 between pitch and spatial direction across 253 pairs — effectively zero, confirming these are independent dimensions of the quaternion. The Hopf fibration S³ → S² physically realizing this split: fiber (S¹, phase ξ₁) carries the pitch; base (S², rotation axis) carries the computation. Music is the fiber; logic is the base.</p>
<h3>Algebra Beats Geometry</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a> crystallizes a principle latent throughout the project: the 13 eigenvector directions are algebraically selected, not geometrically optimized, and geometric improvement destroys computation. The 13 directions achieve t=0 design (worst possible for sampling) but stochastic optimization to t≈1 drops XOR6 solutions from 36 to 4. The computation is algebraic, not geometric. Moving directions to "better" positions breaks the Voronoi partition structure.</p>
<p>This principle recurs at every level: <ul> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_68.html">D68</a>: Euclidean metric on R² gives zero solutions; S² geodesic metric gives 36</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>: the DOF coincidence 2×6+1=13 is algebraic, not a sampling theorem</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a>: geometric distribution quality and computational quality are anti-correlated</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a>: algebraic coherence (shared intermediate products at depth d) beats vocabulary (more directions and angles from strided sampling)</li> </ul>
<h3>The "Wall Was X Not Y" Pattern</h3>
<p>A structural pattern that recurs three times, always with the same form: an apparent capacity ceiling is identified, exhaustive search confirms zero solutions, then the wall is located in a specific component and bypassed by changing that component:</p>
<p>1. <strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a></strong>: XOR parity at ζ₈ has zero solutions out of 100M quartets with split-sigmoid    activation. Wall was in the <strong>activation</strong> (split-sigmoid destroys phase), not the    lattice. Resolution: k-sector activation, 906 solutions at k=6.</p>
<p>2. <strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">D76</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">D77</a></strong>: XOR8 at ζ₈ has zero solutions out of 10,626 quadruples with S²-Voronoi    activation. Wall was in the <strong>activation</strong> (S²-only discards eigenvalue angle), not    the root of unity. Resolution: S¹×S² product activation, 6 solutions.</p>
<p>3. <strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">D78</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a></strong>: XOR10 at ζ₈ has zero solutions exhaustively confirmed under all tested    activations. Wall was in <strong>group finiteness</strong> (binary octahedral group closes at 24    elements), not the architecture. Resolution: ζ₁₂ (infinite group), 124 solutions.</p>
<p>4. <strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a></strong>: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s "XOR dies at N&gt;=7" appeared to be a fundamental DKC capacity limit.    Wall was in the <strong>k-regime</strong> (k=128 at N=8 gives k/2^N=0.5, deep pigeonhole), not    strand count or algebra. Resolution: k=4096 at n=8 gives XOR8=22266, beating n=6.</p>
<p>The pattern teaches: before concluding a function is unreachable, locate the specific component enforcing the wall. The topology/algebra is almost never the ultimate bottleneck.</p>
<h3>DKC is Additive</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> proves formally what <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a> and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a> assumed operationally: DKC is fundamentally an additive computation (weight vector sum), not a multiplicative one (braid matrix product). The algebraic reason: complementing all input bits maps the braid matrix M to its inverse M⁻¹, which shares the same eigenvector cell (antipodal identification), but changes parity. Multiplicative braid products are structurally parity-blind. This connects retroactively to the entire forward DKC arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>): those demos always used additive weight vectors and the present demo explains why multiplicative formulations were never viable.</p>
<p>The same finding appears independently in the Nazer-Gastpar connection noted from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>: the "compute-and-forward" structure of lattice codes is additive by design. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> confirms DKC is a concrete instance of that framework.</p>
<h3>Finite vs Infinite Group as the Capacity Governor</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a> establish that the fundamental variable governing maximum XOR capacity is group finiteness, not the root of unity index N or the arithmetic details of the ring. A finite quaternion group (ζ₄: Q₄ with 4 elements; ζ₈: binary octahedral with 24) imposes a hard ceiling — the catalog closes, combinatorial diversity saturates, and XOR capacity terminates. An infinite group (all other tested roots: ζ₆, ζ₁₀, ζ₁₂, ζ₁₆, ζ₂₀) has no such ceiling within the explored range.</p>
<p>The two finite cases correspond to quantum-dimension-zero points ([2]_q = 0 at ζ₄ and ζ₈), where the TL algebra is maximally non-semisimple. These are exactly the lattice roots where Kuperberg's #P-hardness theorem does NOT apply — the tractable computational regime. The non-lattice infinite-group roots are where hardness applies, and those roots are also where unbounded XOR capacity is possible.</p>
<h3>Crossing Depth as Computational Capacity</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> reinterprets the scaling law from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">D81</a> through the lens of knot theory: each closure round = one generator multiplication = one crossing in the braid/knot sense. A depth-d quaternion encodes d crossings of the associated knot diagram. The capacity law max_xor ≈ depth + 6 says computational power scales linearly with crossing depth.</p>
<p>This connects knot topology directly to computational capacity: more complexly knotted strands compute more than many simply-knotted strands with the same or greater vocabulary. The logarithmic scaling law from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">D81</a> is a corollary: catalog grows exponentially per depth round (roughly 2× each round), so log₂(catalog) ≈ depth, giving max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog) + const.</p>
<p>Consistent with Kuperberg's #P-hardness: the hardness is in <em>generating</em> deep entries (exponential BFS cost to compute d crossings), while the algebraic gain from those entries is linear — the #P structure reflects the generation cost, not the usage cost.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> extends this picture: writhe (net signed crossing count, independent of depth at r = 0.14) is a second crossing-level resource. Jones normalization removes the writhe- dependent phase factor (-A³)^{-w} — the TQFT framing anomaly — and costs exactly 2 XOR levels at every root tested. Framing = +2 XOR, depth unit = +2 XOR: the two resources are equal in magnitude, independent, and additive. The resource decomposition conjecture (supported) is: DKC capacity ≈ lattice base (XOR6) + 2 × depth_rounds + 2 × framing_present.</p>
<h3>Null States as Directional Vocabulary</h3>
<p>At ζ₈, 9 of 24 catalog entries are bracket-null (Re(q) = 0, Kauffman trace vanishes). These are not computational dead weight. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> demonstrates that removing them drops XOR capacity from XOR8 to XOR6 — below the random-removal baseline of 7.8. The mechanism is purely directional: null entries cover 6 S² directions (cube-edge midpoints) absent from all non-null entries, with 1.00 unique direction per null entry vs. 0.47 for non-null. All null entries sit at half-angle 90°, a single point on S¹ — their entire computational contribution comes from S² directional diversity, not angular variation.</p>
<p>The depth-null correlation is striking: depth-3 stratum (the maximally deep entries) is 100% null. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> together imply that the deepest crossings — the ones contributing the most to capacity per depth-law — are simultaneously the algebraically invisible ones (zero trace). The LCFT interpretation (Gurarie 1993 / Gaberdiel-Kausch 1996) is that null entries are the Jordan-cell partners of "logarithmic" non-null entries sharing the same S² axis; removing the null state removes the Jordan-cell anchor, collapsing the coupled pair.</p>
<p>The null fraction dilutes sharply with group size (ζ₄=75%, ζ₈=37.5%, ζ₁₂=3%): nulls are a finite-group boundary phenomenon concentrated exactly where the TL algebra is maximally non-semisimple (quantum-dimension-zero points). The ζ₈ regime is where nulls represent the most structurally significant fraction.</p>
<h3>Null Indispensability as Regime-Dependent Phenomenon</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> established null indispensability at ζ₈. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">D87</a> reveals this is a finite-group phenomenon: at ζ₁₂ (infinite group, 4096 entries), removing all 121 bracket-null entries preserves full XOR capacity (XOR6/8/10/12 all 32 winners). The transition mechanism is direction density — ζ₈ has 13 total directions with 6 null-only (sparse, loss is catastrophic), ζ₁₂ has 2043 directions with 67 null-only (dense, non-null coverage absorbs the loss). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">D88</a> provides the geometric explanation: per-direction spherical design residual at ζ₁₂ is 8× lower than ζ₈.</p>
<p>This refines the LCFT interpretation from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>: null entries as Jordan-cell anchors are structurally critical only in the sparse-direction finite-group regime. In the dense-direction infinite-group regime, the non-null states alone provide sufficient manifold dimensionality. The RC (Reservoir Computing) null-state hypothesis similarly applies only in sparse regimes.</p>
<h3>Rigid Anchors vs Flexible Scaffolding</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">D88</a> anatomizes the 13 ζ₈ directions into two computational roles: <ul> <li><strong>4 non-null body-diagonal directions</strong> (70.5° mutual angle): rigid computational anchors. Perturbation causes 8% XOR loss at 10°. Load-bearing for parity satisfaction.</li> <li><strong>6 null-only edge-midpoint directions</strong> (60°/90° mutual angles): flexible topological scaffolding. Perturbation causes -2.4% XOR loss (a slight GAIN). Movable without damage.</li> </ul>
<p>This explains <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a>'s catastrophic Voronoi destruction (36→4 XOR6, 89% loss): <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a> used Voronoi-only activation, which has knife-edge sensitivity to direction perturbation. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">D88</a>'s k-ladder activation (8 k_sec values) provides 14× better resilience (6.4% loss vs 89%) because small direction shifts are absorbed by switching angular resolution. Constrained optimization (nulls free, non-nulls clamped to 2°) achieves 48% design improvement with only 2.8% XOR loss.</p>
<h3>Axis Cancellation and Relational Computation</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">D90</a> identifies the concrete mechanism behind "algebraic coherence" (the unexplained term from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a>): XOR winners preferentially contain anti-aligned quaternion pairs (axis dot product ≈ -0.75 vs -0.65 for random). Nearly-opposite rotation axes partially cancel, yielding sum quaternions with low rotation angles (30-66°) that create the fine-grained sector separations needed for parity.</p>
<p>The mechanism is relational, not positional. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">D90</a>'s spectral inversion proves this: the S² point cloud bandwidth DECREASES with depth (BW_90% drops from l=4 to l=2, power concentrates at l=0 = uniform), yet computation improves linearly. Individual entry positions become LESS informative as the catalog grows; what matters is how entries combine. Cross-depth algebraic constraints (BFS ancestry restricts gen × deep sums to 73 distinct angles from 50K pairs) provide the relational structure.</p>
<h3>Balanced Exponentials and the Parity Wall</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">D90</a> proposes and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">D91</a> confirms the balanced exponentials explanation for the linear depth law: BFS closure adds vocabulary at ~2×/round; parity constraints demand 4×/XOR weight level. The ratio 2:4 = 1:2 predicts ~2 depth rounds per additional weight, giving max_xor ≈ depth + 6. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">D91</a> proves this from the complementary direction: the activation is not the bottleneck. Sweeping k_sec from 2 to 48 and Voronoi directions from 2 to 114 changes XOR8 winner count from hundreds to thousands but never changes max_xor. Finer resolution reveals more solutions to the same parity constraint; it does not enable higher parity.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a> closes the arc: the +/-q encoding is structurally parity-locked. The (0,0)≡(1,1) collision (masks 0...0 and 1...1 always produce identical sums = zero) means any function where f(0...0) ≠ f(1...1) is impossible — ruling out AND, OR, MAJ, THRESHOLD under any activation whatsoever. The depth law describes the capacity curve for the encoding's ONLY achievable function family: parity.</p>
<h3>Encoding Determines Function</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a>/<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>'s 1-weight-per-input (1wpi) encoding with split-sigmoid/MVN activation computes all 13 NPN classes including parity. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>'s +/-q paired encoding is parity-locked. The contrast is encoding-specific, not a fundamental DKC limit. The 1wpi encoding assigns one catalog entry per input bit, giving each weight independent combinatorial freedom. The +/-q encoding constrains each weight to contribute ±q or 0, creating per-weight pair cancellations (sign-flip symmetry: combined_cell(S) = combined_cell(-S)) that funnel all computational power into parity — the single Boolean function outside AC⁰.</p>
<h3>BFS Growth as Braid Group Invariant</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a> establish that BFS catalog growth is a property of the braid group B_n, not of the TL module chosen. All three tested n=6 modules (W_{6,0} dim=5, W_{6,2} dim=9, W_{6,4} dim=5 non-simple) produce BIT-FOR-BIT identical BFS depth profiles: 1, 11, 77, 439, 2233, 10603, 32768. Max coefficient magnitudes are also identical across simple modules. Growth rate converges toward (n-1)x per round, confirming the sl_d functor thesis from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>n (strands)</th><th>Demo</th><th>Generators</th><th>Growth rate</th><th>Predicted</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">D98</a></td><td>4</td><td>~2.2x</td><td>2 (sl_2)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a></td><td>6</td><td>~3.1x</td><td>3 (sl_3)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a></td><td>8</td><td>~4.0x</td><td>4 (sl_4)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">103</a></td><td>10</td><td>~5.0x</td><td>5 (sl_5)</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a></td><td>14</td><td>~5.1x</td><td>7 (sl_7)</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The implication is profound: the "reservoir" (BFS catalog) is invariant across modules. Only the "readout" (activation function = sign hash of matrix entries) changes. This cleanly separates reservoir dynamics from readout design, exactly as the reservoir computing framework predicts.</p>
<h3>Sign-Rank Expansion and Compressed Sensing</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a> discovers that sign quantization (ternary {-1,0,+1} projection) can INCREASE effective dimension: W_{6,2} has raw rank 244/324 (75.3%) but sign-rank 292/324 (90.1%) — a gain of 48 independent dimensions. The nonlinear sign() function breaks linear dependencies that exist over Z. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> extends this: W_{8,2} at 16384 entries shows sign-rank 2003 vs raw 1096, expansion factor 1.83x and still growing.</p>
<p>This connects to 1-bit compressed sensing (Boufounos-Baraniuk 2008): sign-hash activation is a 1-bit quantization of algebraic integer components. The cross-block activation works because branching cross-terms have low intra-block coherence (near-orthogonal TL_5 pieces), satisfying the incoherence condition for CS recovery. The sign-rank table across all modules:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Module</th><th>dim</th><th>Raw %</th><th>Sign %</th><th>Expansion</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Delta_1</td><td>2</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>1.00x</td></tr><tr><td>W_{4,2}</td><td>3</td><td>77.8%</td><td>88.9%</td><td>1.14x</td></tr><tr><td>W_{5,3}</td><td>4</td><td>96.9%</td><td>100%</td><td>1.03x</td></tr><tr><td>W_{6,0}</td><td>5</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>1.00x</td></tr><tr><td>W_{6,2}</td><td>9</td><td>75.3%</td><td>90.1%</td><td>1.20x</td></tr><tr><td>W_{8,0}</td><td>14</td><td>90.6%</td><td>97.8%</td><td>1.08x</td></tr><tr><td>W_{8,2}</td><td>28</td><td>34.9%</td><td>63.9%</td><td>1.83x</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The pattern: expansion is greatest for high-dimensional modules with redundancy (many Z-linear dependencies to break), and smallest for low-dimensional modules that are already maximally independent.</p>
<h3>Relational vs Individual: Computation is Collective</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a> crystallizes a theme running through the project: DKC capacity is determined by relational/algebraic properties of the catalog, never by individual/dynamical properties of single entries. The evidence is cumulative:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a></strong>: topological entropy (an individual dynamical property) is completely orthogonal to DKC Boolean computation — both periodic and pseudo-Anosov braids compute XOR at 100% participation. The TL visibility filter erases all dynamical information.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">D90</a></strong>: spectral inversion — S² bandwidth DECREASES with depth while computation IMPROVES. Individual entry positions become less informative; relational structure (cross-depth composition) is what matters.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">D95</a></strong>: COMM-only and NON-COMM-only each perform similarly in isolation; the synergy emerges only from their combination.</li>
<li><strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a></strong>: graph-theoretic parity prediction works precisely because it measures relational properties (product closure, additive v_2 connectivity) rather than single- value properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>The TL visibility filter from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a> provides the mechanism: properties that survive the TL quotient at delta=0 (writhe, algebraic phase) correlate with DKC output; properties that do not survive (entropy, spectral radius) are invisible. The quotient is the filter that separates relational from individual structure.</p>
<h3>Graph-Theoretic Parity Prediction (The <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> Trilogy)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> form a trilogy establishing that algebraic graph structure predicts parity capability:</p>
<p><strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a></strong> (Algebraic Graph Density) builds the analytical foundation: every entry of a braid representation matrix at delta=0 is axis-aligned (exactly one nonzero Z[zeta_8] component), proved via a constructive Z/4Z phase formula. The nesting parity Z/2Z grading, major index bipartite invariant, and q-Catalan identity are novel mathematical results. DKC at delta=0 reduces to integer path counting plus a three-variable phase formula: effective computation is Z × Z/4Z per matrix entry.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a></strong> (Parity Vocabulary) shows graph structure PREDICTS parity capability. Maximum structural contrast: parity has 17 product closure edges (connected P_3), poison has ZERO (empty graph). The dual-channel theorem: parity requires BOTH multiplicative phase coherence (product closure &gt; 0) AND additive magnitude diversity (v_2 connectivity &gt; trivial). Maps onto T-gate/Hadamard decomposition in quantum circuit synthesis.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a></strong> (Encoding Dependence) tests the dual-channel theorem at delta=sqrt(2) and discovers the encoding-dependent refinement: at delta=sqrt(2) with multiplicative encoding, parity and non-parity are structurally indistinguishable on 7/8 edge types. Product closure is the sole discriminator — but its polarity is INVERTED (parity wants LOW product closure, opposite of <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>). The sign flips with encoding type. When algebra is rich (j=0 sector alive, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_52.html">D52</a>), the simplest activation (Re&gt;0) suffices because no structural deficits need compensating.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>4. Surprise Connections</h2>
<h3>Fibonacci Golden Ratio in ell=5 Ring (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_58.html">D58</a>)</h3>
<p>At ell=5, delta = phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2. Delta powers are literal Fibonacci numbers: phi^k = F(k-1) + F(k)*phi. The "Fibonacci anyon" name is not categorical --- it is arithmetically literal. This connects number theory (Fibonacci sequence), representation theory (TL algebra at ell=5), and topological quantum computing (anyonic universality).</p>
<h3>WRT Convergence (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_15.html">D15</a>)</h3>
<p>Greedy angle selection (optimizing an information-theoretic criterion) independently converges to within 1.5% of the WRT level-3 evaluation point from Chern-Simons theory. The bracket "knows" which angles are informationally optimal, and those angles are the algebraically special ones. Topology knows information theory.</p>
<h3>Forward-Reverse Duality (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_45.html">D45</a>)</h3>
<p>Spearman rho = -0.82 between topology frequency (how often a braid produces a function) and decomposition quality (how well trained weights match bracket values). Functions the bracket "likes" to produce are functions whose trained solutions live near the bracket lattice. This was measured independently from two directions and arrived at the same ordering.</p>
<h3>Correlation Reversal Under Activation Change (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_47.html">D47</a>)</h3>
<p>Split-sigmoid and MVN-continuous produce opposite correlation signs between topology frequency and decomposition quality (rho = -0.78 vs +0.55). The two activations literally access complementary sectors of the bracket algebra. This was not predicted.</p>
<h3>Neglecton Closure (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_49.html">D49</a>)</h3>
<p>The perturbation approach (adding radical-element weights from loops=2 states) yields 148 new Z[zeta_8] values from 15,242 previously invisible braids --- but ALL new values share angles with existing standard values. No new angular directions at any perturbation order. The weight space already contains everything; only the activation geometry limits computation.</p>
<h3>11/13 Wall Universality (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_55.html">D55</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_58.html">D58</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_59.html">D59</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_61.html">D61</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_62.html">D62</a>)</h3>
<p>Three independent evaluation levels (ell=4, 5, 6) with three different cyclotomic rings (Z[i], Z[zeta_5], Z[zeta_24]) all produce exactly 11/13 reachable NPN classes under Re&gt;0 multiplicative encoding, with the same two classes (0x06, 0x1B) unreachable. This universality was unexpected: the rings have different dimensions (2, 4, 8), different algebraic properties, different delta values. The wall is purely activation-geometric.</p>
<h3>Two Different Proof Structures for Two Unreachable Classes (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_62.html">D62</a>)</h3>
<p>0x06 and 0x1B fail for different geometric reasons: <ul> <li>0x06: local parallelogram argument (four semicircle gaps all &lt; pi)</li> <li>0x1B: global interval squeeze (lower bound &gt; upper bound on one angle)</li> </ul>
<p>Despite both being "unreachable by half-plane," they are obstructed by fundamentally different mechanisms. This hints at a richer obstruction theory.</p>
<h3>Matroid Theory Enters DKC (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_63.html">D63</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">D64</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_63.html">D63</a> introduces oriented matroids to explain the parity scaling law. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">D64</a> deepens this by proving the parity hierarchy {XOR2, XOR3, XOR4, XOR5} is a legitimate matroid minor chain: deletion gives XOR_{n-1}, contraction gives XNOR_{n-1}, both 100% verified exhaustively. The upward funnel (99.3% → 39.2% → 19.2% → 0%) collapses catastrophically at n=6, and the wall geometry is exactly explained by the self-doubling impossibility theorem. This connects DKC for the first time to the classical theory of matroids (Reiner's cyclotomic matroids mu_N are the candidate framework for the 44 good / 31 poison vocabulary split).</p>
<h3>The k=24 Coincidence (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a> discovers generalized XOR6 first appears at k=24 sectors on S¹ — an empirical fact with no immediate explanation. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a> independently discovers that SU(2) braid representations produce exactly 24 distinct quaternions (the vertices of the 24-cell in S³). These two 24s are not coincidental: the S¹ minimum sector count is the projection (via trace) of the 24-cell's 24 vertices onto the circle. The complex S¹ computation is a shadow of the S³ geometry.</p>
<h3>The 24-Cell as Braid Geometry (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a> established that the Kauffman bracket at delta=0 takes values in Z[zeta_8], computing exact XOR triples from scalar bracket values. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a> lifts this to full SU(2): the same braids that produce 100 distinct scalar values in Z[zeta_8] produce exactly 24 distinct unit quaternions — the binary octahedral group, vertices of the 24-cell. The scalar bracket is the trace of the quaternion (a 1D projection of 4D geometry). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a> Part J quantifies the information content: bracket and quaternion agree on only 12.86% of braid pairs, resolve each other's collisions at different rates (450 vs 8,424), confirming they are genuinely complementary.</p>
<h3>Hopf Phase Inertness (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_70.html">D70</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a> proves computationally that the Hopf fiber phase ξ₁ carries zero DKC information (zero XOR6 solutions at all k=4..32). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_70.html">D70</a> confirms this musically: pitch (eigenvalue angle θ = arccos(a), related to trace) and space (eigenvector direction) have Pearson r = -0.06. Two independent methods — exhaustive combinatorial search and continuous correlation over 253 pairs — both find the fiber inert. The Hopf fibration S³ → S² is not just a geometric description; it is the exact decomposition separating computationally active (base) from inert (fiber) information.</p>
<h3>The 13=13 Theorem (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">D69</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a> discovers empirically that a 13-direction Voronoi solves XOR6 at 14 cells. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">D69</a> shows these 13 directions are universal across all ζ_N (nesting theorem) and that ζ_8 is the coarsest root producing them. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a> explains WHY 13 is the magic number: spherical harmonic mode l has (2l+1) independent components; 2×6+1=13; therefore l=6 is the exact bandwidth threshold with a sharp 0%→100% phase transition. The three demos form a closed explanatory loop: data-derived directions (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>) → algebraic universality (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">D69</a>) → harmonic-analytic necessity (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>). The DOF formula l≥(N-1)/2 also predicts <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">D69</a>'s trivialization: ζ_16 has 3,457 directions, requiring l≥1728, which makes any coarse partition trivially sufficient.</p>
<h3>Vocabulary Stratification and the Poison Octant (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">D64</a>)</h3>
<p>Of 83 class-1 catalog values at k=15, exactly 44 appear in XOR5 solutions ("good") and 31 appear only in dead-end XOR4 solutions ("poison"). The 31 poison values span octants {1,2,3,5,6,7} but never octant 4 — an asymmetry with no obvious geometric explanation that connects to Reiner's cyclotomic matroid mu_8 theory (values at 8th roots of unity as matroid elements, octant 4 as a distinguished cocircuit). The exact-arithmetic requirement (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">D64</a>) — floating-point produces 420 spurious failures at sector boundaries — echoes <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a>'s discovery that exact Z[zeta_8] arithmetic was essential for forward DKC.</p>
<h3>4 Notes Spanning All Musical Tension (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_70.html">D70</a>)</h3>
<p>The binary octahedral group's 4 eigenvalue angles (0°, 45°, 60°, 90°) map to exactly the four foundational interval types: unison (C, perfect consonance), minor third (Eb), major third (E), tritone (F#, maximum dissonance). The six pairwise intervals cover all basic dyad categories. The Garside element (σ₁σ₂)³ produces the melody Eb E F# E Eb C — a complete arch visiting all four knot notes. The tritone-antipodal correspondence on the dodecahedron (antipodal faces carry tritone pairs) suggests the circle of fifths and the braid group share a deeper symmetry argument, not merely a notational coincidence.</p>

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a> explains why 13 directions suffice for XOR6: the DOF coincidence 2×6+1=13 means l=6 spherical harmonics can exactly address 13 independent directions. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a> tests this from the opposite direction: can better geometric distribution (higher t-design) do better? The answer is definitively no — the eigenvector configuration achieves t=0 (worst possible), yet stochastic optimization to t≈1 (2.6× better geometry) produces 9× fewer XOR6 solutions (4 vs 36). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a> thus confirms <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a> by contradiction: if the DOF coincidence were irrelevant and sampling quality were what mattered, better-distributed directions would compute MORE functions, not fewer. The fact that they compute fewer proves that the mechanism is algebraic DOF matching, not sampling theory.</p>

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> proves that DKC is fundamentally additive. This is not a new discovery operationally — all forward DKC demos since <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a> used weight-vector sums — but <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> provides the algebraic explanation for why multiplication was never viable: the complement-bits symmetry maps M to M⁻¹, which shares the same eigenvector cell, making parity invisible to any multiplicative formulation. This retroactively explains a silent design choice in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a> and every subsequent DKC demo. It also explains why the split-sigmoid wall (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a>) and the S²-only wall (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">D76</a>) were in the <em>activation</em> and not the <em>algebra</em>: the algebra was always additive-capable; the question was always which activation could read it.</p>

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">D74</a> proves bracket and Voronoi cell are incomparable at the individual-quaternion catalog level (neither refines the other: 80% of bracket collisions separated by cell, 54% of cell collisions separated by bracket). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a> proves eigenvalue angle subsumes Voronoi cell at the sum-quaternion level (angle perfectly predicts parity for all 36 winners).

In both cases: the topology and algebra were never the obstruction; the wall was entirely in the activation function's choice of what to read from the quaternion. Both resolutions use a finer activation that reads angular information the original activation discarded. The two instances separated by 27 demos are structurally identical.</p>

Unlike <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a> and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">D76</a> (where the wall was in the activation), this wall is in the group structure: the binary octahedral group closes at 24 elements, and the combinatorial diversity of 24 elements is exhausted at 5-element selection (quintuples).

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">D81</a> measures the empirical scaling law for ζ₁₂: max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog) + 4.6. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> reveals the mechanism: catalog size grows exponentially per closure round (roughly 2×), so log₂(catalog) ≈ round_number ≈ depth. The true linear variable is crossing depth (max_xor ≈ depth + 6), and the logarithmic law is its corollary. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">D81</a> discovers the phenomenology; <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> identifies the underlying cause.

<h3>√n Magnitude Quantization (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a> finds that the magnitude of additive quaternion sums takes only 6 values: √{0,1,2,3,4,6} (√5 is absent). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> finds that distinct partial sums after 6 steps number exactly 27 (not 64). Both results reflect the same algebraic constraint: the inner product structure of the 24-cell allows only half-integer values {-1, -½, 0, ½, 1}, so integer sums can only reach specific norms. The magnitude constraint (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a>) explains why the partial sum space is compressed (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a>): even though 6 weights from a 24-element catalog could in principle produce 2^6 = 64 distinct sums, the lattice structure reduces this to 27 — the "odometer" that <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a>'s compass-without-odometer metaphor describes.</p>

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> first observed that ζ₁₂ capacity seemed to cap at XOR10 while the bracket catalog appeared to reach XOR12, a puzzling 2-level discrepancy. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> resolves it: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> was inadvertently working with Jones-normalized quantities (the bracket evaluation used in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a>'s capacity measurement implicitly applies the writhe phase factor). The bracket genuinely reaches XOR12; the Jones normalization costs exactly 2 levels. The N-2 pattern was Jones capacity all along, not a truncation artifact or a property of ζ₁₂ itself. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> is the retroactive explanation for a mystery that persisted from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> through <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> established max_xor ≈ depth + 6: each closure round contributes +2 XOR levels. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> establishes that writhe (net signed crossing count) contributes an additional +2 XOR levels independently of depth. Depth-writhe correlation r = 0.14 across 4096 ζ₁₂ entries confirms these are genuinely separate quantities — a deep entry can have low writhe (crossings cancel) or high writhe (crossings accumulate). The "+2 per resource unit" pattern holds for both axes. The resource decomposition conjecture (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a>) gives a unified formula: DKC capacity ≈ XOR6 (lattice base) + 2 × depth_rounds + 2 × framing_present. Reservoir computing theory (Jaeger 2001, Maass 2002) predicts exactly this additivity for independent channels.</p>
<h3>24-Cell Structure Survives Jones Normalization (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a>)</h3>

At ζ₈: the same 24 directions persist through Jones normalization.

The depth hierarchy is also a null hierarchy — the entries that contribute most capacity per depth unit are simultaneously the algebraically invisible ones (Re(q)=0, trace=0). This is not a coincidence: deep entries are built by multiplying many generators; repeated multiplication drives the quaternion's real part toward zero (the fixed-point attractor of the depth recursion is the equatorial S² where Re(q)=0). The computational mechanism lives in the Jordan-cell coupling between null entries and their S²-sharing non-null partners.</p>

As the group grows toward infinity, the null fraction approaches zero. Nulls are a finite-group boundary effect — in an infinite group the discrete S¹ spectrum collapses and the half-angle=90° "null point" becomes an infinitesimal measure. The capacity ceiling imposed by finite group order (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">D78</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> resolution) and the directional indispensability of null entries (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>) are two faces of the same finite-group constraint.</p>

The null entries carry XOR8 capacity via directional coverage; the ζ₄ case (75% null) is entirely saturated by nulls and achieves zero XOR capacity (all information is directional but too few entries to fill the parity structure). Non-semisimplicity (δ=0) is thus both the obstacle (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_47.html">D47</a> conjecture) and the mechanism (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>): the radical elements that block scalar computation redirect computation into the geometric channel.</p>

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a> proved the 13=13 theorem: minimum spherical harmonic bandwidth l=6 because 2×6+1=13 equals the eigenvector direction count. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> now anatomizes those 13 directions by null/non- null participation: 6 null-only (cube-edge midpoints, 1/√2 components), 4 non-null-only (tetrahedral axes, 1/√3 components), 3 shared (coordinate axes). The 13 directions do not form a uniform algebraic class — they are a superposition of three geometrically distinct families. The l=6 bandwidth theorem counts all 13 as equal; <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> reveals that 6 of them are accessible only through the null entries. If nulls were removed, only 7 directions remain, requiring l≥3 bandwidth — which still technically suffices but the Voronoi partition would be coarser, losing the XOR8 solutions that depend on fine-grained null-direction coverage.</p>
<h3>Three-Level Discarding: Jones, Null, and LCFT</h3>
<p>The project has now documented three distinct "discarding" operations that TQFT/CFT perform on topological data, each of which turns out to carry computational content:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Jones normalization (Jones 1985, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a>)</strong>: removes the writhe-dependent phase factor    (-A³)^{-w} as a "framing anomaly." <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> proves this factor = +2 XOR levels of capacity. 2. <strong>Bracket-null entries (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>)</strong>: entries with Re(q)=0 are invisible to the scalar    Kauffman trace (the Jones polynomial's building block). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> proves they maintain the    S² directional vocabulary essential for XOR8. 3. <strong>LCFT null states (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> interpretation)</strong>: in logarithmic CFT, null states ⟨N|N⟩=0 are    paired with logarithmic partners via Jordan cells. The null entry (DKC analog: Re(q)=0)    is computationally invisible in the scalar channel but anchors the Jordan-cell coupling    that carries the logarithmic partner's content.</p>
<p>All three operations are motivated in physics by a desire to obtain a clean topological invariant. All three discard exactly the structures that DKC uses for computation. The "maximally degenerate point" (δ=0) that enables tractable DKC is the same point where all three discarding mechanisms are most aggressive.</p>

They cover 6 S² directions (cube-edge midpoints) absent from all 15 non-null entries; removing them drops XOR8 → XOR6, worse than random removal (baseline 7.8). The null entries are directionally efficient (1.00 dir/entry vs. 0.47 for non-null) and occupy a single S¹ point (half-angle 90°), deriving all capacity from S² diversity. At XOR8 they participate at 0.79× expected rate (disproportionately required). The LCFT interpretation is consistent: null entries are Jordan-cell partners; removing them collapses the partner's anchor and the coupled computational content. Cross-root comparison confirms this is a finite-group effect that dilutes toward zero as the group grows.</p>

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a> tests the 13 directions as a spherical design and finds they achieve t=0 (worst possible), yet geometrically optimized directions produce 9× fewer solutions — confirming <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>'s DOF argument from the negative direction and establishing that algebraic placement, not geometric distribution, governs DKC computation. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> proves DKC is fundamentally additive (not multiplicative), establishes 82.8% universal automaton determinism across all 36 XOR6 winners, and identifies the "compass without odometer" structure: the Voronoi cell captures eigenvector direction but discards magnitude, the precise source of the 17% non-determinism. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">D74</a> proves the Kauffman bracket and Voronoi cell are incomparable braid invariants, with the combined (bracket, cell) pair giving 119 equivalence classes vs 100 bracket-alone, and identifies 6 distinct computational orbit types in the 14-cell partition. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a> establishes the binocular channel: for additive sums, the eigenvalue angle subsumes the cell (angle perfectly predicts parity for all 36 winners), giving 2.3× capacity over cell-only, while the multiplicative channel (staying inside the 24-cell group) has zero XOR6 solutions.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">D76</a> scales to 8 inputs and confirms 0 solutions under S²-only activation (pigeonhole: 256 masks / 14 cells). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">D77</a> resolves this with S¹×S² product activation (112 cells, 6 winners) — the same "wall was activation not algebra" discovery as <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>, one level up. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">D78</a> exhaustively confirms XOR10 = 0 at ζ₈ under all activations, revealing a new type of wall: group finiteness. The binary octahedral group's 24 elements are simply insufficient for 5-element XOR10. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> breaks this wall by switching to ζ₁₂ (infinite group): 124 XOR10 winners, 50+ XOR12. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a> surveys 7 roots of unity and finds only ζ₄ and ζ₈ generate finite SU(2) subgroups — both corresponding to quantum-dimension-zero points, ADE types D and E₇ — while all other roots generate infinite groups with no capacity ceiling within the explored range. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">D81</a> measures the ζ₁₂ scaling law: max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog) + 4.6. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> reinterprets this: depth (closure round = generator multiplication count = knot crossing number) is the linear variable; catalog grows exponentially per round, making the logarithm of catalog equal to depth. The linear depth law (max_xor ≈ depth + 6) reveals that computational power scales linearly with crossing complexity, while the cost of generating depth-d entries scales exponentially — consistent with Kuperberg's #P-hardness structure.</p>
<p>The answer: yes, with a complete capacity theory. The bracket algebra computes Boolean functions through a mechanism that is additive (not multiplicative), algebraic (not geometric), and governed by activation choice (not topology). For ζ₈: 12/13 NPN classes via forward DKC, parity requires k-sector activation, maximum XOR inputs is 8 (hard ceiling from binary octahedral group finiteness). For infinite-group roots (ζ₁₂ and beyond): XOR capacity scales logarithmically with catalog size (equivalently: linearly with knot crossing depth), with no observed ceiling. The 13-direction structure on S² is the computational sweet spot for ζ₈: algebraically forced, geometrically worst, and exactly explained by the 13=13 spherical harmonic DOF theorem.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> resolves a longstanding mystery (the N-2 gap observed in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a>) and reveals that the bracket-to-Jones normalization step costs exactly 2 XOR levels at every root tested — the TQFT framing anomaly is not bookkeeping noise but one discrete unit of computational resource. Writhe (independent of depth at r = 0.14) is a third capacity axis, contributing +2 XOR levels identically to one depth unit: DKC capacity ≈ XOR6 + 2 × depth_rounds + 2 × framing_present. The direction count is framing-invariant; only angular vocabulary is destroyed by Jones normalization.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> opens the internal anatomy of the 24-element ζ₈ catalog: 9 of 24 entries are bracket-null (Re(q)=0), covering 6 S² directions unavailable to the 15 non-null entries. These null entries are indispensable — removing them drops XOR8 → XOR6, below the random- removal baseline. The depth-null identity (depth-3 stratum = 100% null) connects <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>: the crossings that contribute most to capacity per the depth law are simultaneously the ones algebraically invisible to the scalar trace. LCFT Jordan-cell structure explains the coupling: null entries anchor the partner states that carry the directional content. Null fraction dilutes with group size (ζ₄=75%, ζ₈=37.5%, ζ₁₂=3%), confirming this is a finite-group boundary effect concentrated at exactly the quantum-dimension-zero points where TL non-semisimplicity is maximal and DKC computation is most tractable.</p>

<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> is the pivot: the Barrington-Radical Principle — the radical of W_{6,4} carries an abelian writhe character (B_6 → Z/8Z), provably useless for parity by Barrington's theorem — refutes radical-as-resource and establishes that simple modules outperform non-simple at matched dimension. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a> settles the growth law: BFS catalog depth profiles are identical across all three n=6 modules (dim 5, dim 5 non-simple, dim 9), confirming that the BFS tree is a braid group invariant.

Sign-rank expansion (sign quantization breaks 48 linear dependencies in W_{6,2}, expanding effective rank from 244 to 292), the Atkinson sweet spot (optimal component count ~120 at k=128), and branching decomposition (cross-block interaction IS the signal at n=6 but NOT at n=8) provide a detailed understanding of what the sign-hash activation extracts from the matrix representation. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> extends to 8 strands, refuting <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s "XOR dies at N&gt;=7" as a k-regime artifact (k/2^N is the real parameter) and discovering the macrame principle (branching interaction reverses from cross-block to within-block as sub-module blocks become complex).</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a> opens the graph-theoretic prediction arc: topological entropy is completely orthogonal to DKC Boolean computation (falsified prediction, clean null across ALL 8 functions tested). The TL visibility filter explains why: writhe survives the quotient (correlates with DKC), entropy does not (e_i^2=0 kills it). Computation is collective and algebraic, not individual and dynamical.</p>

<p>Barrington's theorem (1989) proves NC¹ = programs over non-solvable groups, and that solvable groups are strictly weaker for branching program computation. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a> is the first computational confirmation of this prediction in a topological computation model. The DKC catalog construction (BFS closure, multiplicative group generation) is Barrington-like: braid words are branching programs, group elements are states, and the additive readout separates Boolean function values. At matched catalog size (24 entries), 2I (non-solvable) beats z8 (solvable) at XOR with the advantage accelerating precisely as the computation becomes harder — exactly Barrington's prediction made concrete in DKC.</p>
<h3>Circuit Complexity AC⁰/TC⁰/Parity Hierarchy in DKC (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>↔Hastad)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s AND/XOR ratio table is Hastad's theorem (1987) made visible. AND is in AC⁰ (low Fourier degree, simple partition geometry). MAJ is TC⁰-complete (intermediate Fourier degree). XOR is parity (full Fourier degree, requires exponential depth in bounded-width). The LMN theorem (1993) explains AND's robustness: AC⁰ Fourier mass concentrates below degree (log n)^d, so AND needs only coarse cell partitions. XOR requires balanced global partitions — the most demanding geometric constraint. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a> confirms this hierarchy is universal: it manifests identically in z8, 2I, and z12. The readout mechanism (1wpi + phase_cell) is the bottleneck, and the group merely modulates how much capacity is available to overcome that bottleneck. The circuit complexity hierarchy is not an abstract classification for DKC — it is a measurable, quantitative prediction about hit-rate divergence.</p>

<p>The wall-identification pattern now has SEVEN instances: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">D98</a>'s trace readout gives ZERO XOR despite the 3-strand algebra being infinite and rich. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>'s Delta_1 module + sign-hash activation recovers 500K+ XOR6 solutions. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> refutes <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s "XOR dies at N&gt;=7" by showing the wall was in the k-regime, not the strand count: 1. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>: wall in split-sigmoid activation, not Z[zeta_8] lattice 2. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">D76</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">D77</a>: wall in S²-only activation, not ζ₈ root of unity 3. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">D78</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a>: wall in group finiteness, not DKC architecture 4. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>: wall in +/-q encoding, not the activation (parity lock) 5. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>: wall in combined_cell normalization, not 1wpi encoding 6. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">D98</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>: wall in trace readout / reducible representation, not multi-strand algebra 7. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>→<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>: wall in k-regime (k/2^N ratio), not strand count or algebra</p>
<h3>Traceless Hub Commutator Universal Pattern (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a>)</h3>
<p>A new recurring pattern: super-hub commutators are traceless in EVERY multi-strand demo where hubs appear. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>: 2 hubs, commutator traceless with strong sl_2 bracket structure (Cartan L1=84, e-root L1=108). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a>: 6 hubs, ALL six commutators traceless AND radical content = 0 (commutators live entirely in the semisimple quotient). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a>: 3 hubs, ALL commutators are the ZERO matrix (hubs mutually commute). The pattern strengthens across demos: from traceless (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>) to traceless + radical-annihilating (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a>) to zero (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a>). Whether this is a theorem (commutators of hub-type entries on TL standard modules are always traceless) or specific to these examples remains open.</p>
<h3>Barrington's Theorem Made Concrete in Topology (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a> first connected Barrington's theorem to DKC by showing the solvability bottleneck computationally: non-solvable 2I outperforms solvable z8 at matched catalog size. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> makes this structural: the radical of W_{6,4} carries an abelian writhe character (B_6 → Z/8Z via A = -zeta_8), computationally proven for ALL 32,768 catalog entries. By Barrington's theorem, abelian groups cannot compute parity. Therefore the radical direction is theoretically guaranteed useless for XOR — and empirically, the simple module W_{6,0} wins at every XOR level. This is the first time a specific TL-algebraic structure has been identified as provably useless by appeal to classical complexity theory, rather than empirical refutation alone.</p>
<h3>BFS Growth Independence Across Three n=6 Modules (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> showed W_{6,0} and W_{6,4} have identical BFS depth profiles. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a> adds W_{6,2} (dim=9, nearly double the dimension): STILL identical at every depth. The BFS catalog is a braid group property. The matrices can be 5×5 or 9×9, simple or non-simple, 0 or 4 through-lines — the BFS tree is the same. This is the reservoir computing interpretation made precise: the reservoir (braid group orbit) is invariant; only the readout (sign hash of which matrix representation) varies.</p>
<h3>Fibonacci Max-Abs Pattern and Radical Constraint (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a>)</h3>
<p>Both simple n=6 modules follow max coefficient magnitude 1,1,2,3,5,8,16 through depth 6. The non-simple W_{6,4} follows strict Fibonacci (1,1,2,3,5,8,13) at depth 6 instead of breaking to 16. The radical appears to constrain coefficient growth to strict Fibonacci — another manifestation of the radical carrying structured (abelian) information. The abelian writhe character from the Barrington-Radical Principle literally constrains the radical row to A^writhe, preventing the "wild" growth seen in simple modules.</p>
<h3>Branching Interaction Reversal: The Macrame Principle (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a> showed that at n=6, the computational signal lives in the cross-block (off-diagonal) components under TL_{n-1} branching restriction: W_{6,2} cross-block (160 comp) beats within-block (164 comp) at k=128. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> tested this at n=8 (symmetric 14+14 branching) and found the OPPOSITE: within-block dominates (XOR6=2940 vs cross-block=532).</p>
<p>The regime transition is the "macrame principle": simple sub-module blocks (dim 4-5) need connections between them for computational fabric, like simple knots needing macrame cord. Complex sub-module blocks (dim 14) are self-sufficient, like complex knots that hold structure without external connections. The crossover lies between dim 5 and dim 14.</p>
<h3>k-Regime Rescues <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s "Dead" Functions (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a> concluded "XOR dies at N&gt;=7" based on experiments at k=128. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> showed this was a k-regime artifact: at k=4096 with n=8, XOR8=22266 (actually BEATING n=6's 21699 at matched k). The ratio k/2^N is the real control parameter: <ul> <li>k=128, N=8: k/2^N = 0.5 (pigeonhole regime — too few cells for 256 masks)</li> <li>k=4096, N=8: k/2^N = 16 (collision avoidance regime — XOR fully alive)</li> </ul>
<p>This is the fourth instance of the "wall was X not Y" pattern in the activation/k-regime family: the apparent strand-count wall was entirely in the activation granularity.</p>
<h3>Topological Entropy Null Extends the TL Visibility Filter (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> established that writhe (which survives the TL quotient) correlates with DKC output. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a> is the negative control: topological entropy (which does NOT survive the TL quotient, because e_i^2=0 kills expanding eigenvalues) is completely orthogonal to DKC computation. Both periodic and pseudo-Anosov braids compute XOR at 100% participation with near-identical scores. The TL quotient at delta=0 is the visibility filter: properties that pass through it (writhe, algebraic phase) are DKC-relevant; properties killed by it (entropy, Burau spectral radius) are DKC-invisible. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a> thus confirms <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> from the complementary direction.</p>
<h3>Axis-Alignment Theorem: Universal Structure at Delta=0 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_35.html">D35</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_35.html">D35</a> established the axiality theorem: bracket values have single nonzero Cyc8 component. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> elevates this from observation to theorem with a constructive proof: the Z/4Z phase formula Entry(r,c) = (path count) <em> zeta_8^{(w - 2</em>(nest(r) + nest(c))) mod 4} gives the phase exactly. Three numbers — writhe, nesting count of source state, nesting count of target state — fully determine which cyclotomic axis a matrix entry lies on. This reduces DKC at delta=0 from cyclotomic arithmetic to integer arithmetic plus a phase lookup, explaining why the computation is so tractable despite living in Z[zeta_8].</p>
<h3>Dual-Channel Theorem and the Amy Bridge (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>'s dual-channel theorem — parity needs both multiplicative phase coherence AND additive magnitude diversity — connects to quantum circuit synthesis through the Amy-Glaudell-Ross (2023) framework. The activation function provides the Hadamard-equivalent magnitude diversity that enables sde=0 ("Clifford") values to compute parity. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a>'s generalized XOR6 at k=24 is reframed: k=24 provides sufficient "Hadamard resource" to complement the phase coherence of the Z[zeta_8] lattice. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>'s k=6 breakthrough is the minimal dual-channel configuration.</p>
<h3>Product Closure Polarity Inversion (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a> (delta=0, additive encoding) found parity wants HIGH product closure (21% density, connected P_3) while poison wants ZERO. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> (delta=sqrt(2), multiplicative encoding) found the opposite: parity wants LOW product closure (14.8%) while non-parity wants HIGH (46.6%). The sign flip is encoding-dependent: under additive encoding, products that stay within the vocabulary reinforce superposition; under multiplicative encoding, products must ESCAPE the vocabulary for sector alternation. The dual-channel theorem holds in both regimes but the polarity of the multiplicative channel reverses.</p>
<h3>Perfect Algebraic Symmetry at Delta≠0 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>↔<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_52.html">D52</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>'s 7/8 edge-type identity between parity and non-parity at delta=sqrt(2) connects to <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_52.html">D52</a>'s observation that j=0 sector liveness at delta≠0 enriches the algebra. When j=0 is alive, the algebra is so rich that both parity and non-parity vocabularies satisfy all structural prerequisites (K_4 quotient, non-trivial v_2 connectivity, adequate additive closure). Raqiya diagnoses algebraic impoverishment (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>, delta=0), not algebraic health (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>, delta≠0). The diagnostic power of graph analysis is strongest exactly where the algebra is most degenerate.</p>
<h3>Rank Saturation Confound Retroactively Affects All Prior Comparisons (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>'s rank saturation analysis revealed that ALL prior cross-module rank comparisons (D99b through <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a>) were confounded by varying oversampling ratios. The rank of W_{8,2} at 512 entries was only 6.9% (severely under-sampled), but the coincidental 34.9% match between W_{8,0} and W_{8,2} at initial checkpoints could have been mistaken for a structural similarity. The methodological lesson: single-checkpoint rank measurements are unreliable for infinite braid groups. Saturation curves at multiple checkpoints are now required — a methodological advancement that retrospectively invalidates some <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a> rank claims as lower bounds rather than structural truths.</p>
