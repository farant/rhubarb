    <h1>Discrete Knotted Computation: A Research Narrative</h1>
<em>Updated through <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">Demo 109</a> (2026-02-26)</em>
<h2>The Thesis</h2>
<p>Topological invariants can be compiled into neural network weights to compute Boolean functions without training. The Kauffman bracket — a state-sum polynomial over knot diagram smoothings — evaluated at roots of unity yields cyclotomic integers that serve as exact algebraic weights for complex-valued neurons. The choice of activation function determines which Boolean functions are computable from this fixed weight lattice. The bracket does not approximate computation; it <em>is</em> computation, evaluated in a ring where correctness is guaranteed by algebraic closure rather than gradient descent.</p>
<p>This is Discrete Knotted Computation (DKC).</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>1. The Foundation: State-Sum Computation as Exact Arithmetic</h2>
<p>The Kauffman bracket assigns to every knot diagram a Laurent polynomial in a formal variable A. The computation is a state sum: enumerate all 2^n ways to smooth n crossings (each crossing resolves into an A-weighted or A^{-1}-weighted channel), count the resulting loops, multiply by delta = -(A^2 + A^{-2}) per loop, and sum. The bracket is a topological invariant of framed links — unchanged by Reidemeister moves II and III, and picking up a predictable factor under move I that writhe normalization absorbs.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">Demos 01</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_09.html">09</a> built this machinery from scratch. PD-code state-sum (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_01.html">Demo 01</a>), braid-word state-sum (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_02.html">Demo 02</a>), TL standard-module traces (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_03.html">Demo 03</a>), tensor-product spin-chain representation (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_04.html">Demo 04</a>), scaling to arbitrary strand count (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_05.html">Demo 05</a>), Jones-Wenzl idempotent projectors (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_06.html">Demo 06</a>), bidirectional PD/braid conversion (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_07.html">Demos 07</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_08.html">08</a>), and Reidemeister invariance verification (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_09.html">Demo 09</a>). By <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_05.html">Demo 05</a>, the quantum trace formula was confirmed at every scale: tr_q = (-1)^n <em> delta </em> bracket(oracle), with sign depending on strand parity.</p>
<p>The critical observation enabling everything that follows: when A is specialized to a root of unity, the bracket value is no longer a polynomial. It is a <em>number</em> — and by Habiro's integrality theorem (2002), that number is a cyclotomic integer. At A = e^{i<em>5pi/4}, every bracket value lives in Z[zeta_8] = {a + b</em>zeta_8 + c<em>zeta_8^2 + d</em>zeta_8^3 : a,b,c,d in Z}. This ring has class number 1 — it is a unique factorization domain — and all arithmetic is exact integer operations on 4-tuples. Zero floating-point error, ever.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_10.html">Demo 10</a> bridged from symbolic to numerical evaluation, replacing Laurent polynomials with complex evaluation at A = e^{i*theta}. This gave a 50x memory reduction per matrix entry and scaled the spin-chain representation from 32x32 to 256x256. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_11.html">Demos 11</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_16.html">16</a> explored the resulting waveform signatures, discovering that greedy-optimal classification angles converge to within 1.5% of Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev evaluation points — algebraically special angles are informationally optimal angles. Topology knows information theory.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>2. Braid Computation and the Parity Shadow</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_18.html">Demos 18</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_25.html">25</a> established that braids compute. Exhaustive search found specific braid words whose bracket amplitudes encode NOT (2 strands, 6 crossings), NAND (3 strands, 5 crossings), and AND gates. NOT + NAND is Turing complete. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_19.html">Demo 19</a> built a full Boolean expression compiler, evaluating a 1-bit adder (8/8 correct) through recursive bracket thresholding. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_20.html">Demo 20</a> mapped the error landscape: |delta| = 2|cos(2*theta)| universally predicts gate viability, with exact computation at the 8th roots of unity where delta vanishes.</p>
<p>But something was missing. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_22.html">Demo 22</a>'s exhaustive search for minimum-braid-complexity gates across all 3-input Boolean functions found a gap: functions involving XOR appeared only at longer braid lengths, and parity (XOR of all inputs) was absent entirely. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_25.html">Demo 25</a> confirmed this with full measurement matrices: across 1554 four-strand braids and four closure types, the parity function appeared zero times. Every braid had measurement-matrix rank 4 — the closures always provided maximal information — yet parity remained unreachable.</p>
<p>This was the first shadow of the wall.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>3. The Discovery: Forward DKC</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_26.html">Demos 26</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_28.html">28</a> probed the <em>reverse</em> direction: can trained neural network weights be decomposed into bracket values? Complex-valued networks (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_27.html">Demo 27</a>) outperformed real-valued ones, and gauge-corrected decomposition showed that phase carries computational information destroyed by the Born-rule projection |z|^2. But reverse DKC was fundamentally confounded — at delta=0, bracket amplitudes are integers, so any real number is at most 0.5 from a catalog entry.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">Demo 29</a> reversed the question entirely. Instead of asking whether trained weights <em>match</em> bracket values, it asked: can bracket values <em>be</em> weights?</p>
<p>The answer was immediate and definitive. Implementing exact Z[zeta_8] cyclotomic arithmetic — multiplication via 16 integer multiplies, zero floating point — <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">Demo 29</a> built a catalog of distinct bracket values from 2-3 strand braids of length 1-8 and searched for weight triples (w1, w2, bias) that compute XOR under split-sigmoid activation. Over 100 valid XOR triples were found. RMS error: 0.000. Not approximately zero — exactly zero, because the computation is exact integer arithmetic throughout.</p>
<p>At A = e^{i<em>5pi/4}, the variable A equals -zeta_8, and delta = -(A^2 + A^{-2}) = 0 </em>exactly*. This collapses the state sum to single-loop states only — every multi-loop smoothing contributes zero. The bracket literally counts single-loop resolutions, weighted by phase. This is the key simplification that makes forward DKC tractable.</p>
<p>The result established what <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">Demo 29</a> called the <strong>Training-as-Focusing thesis</strong>: the topological structure of the bracket is sufficient for computation. Neural network training does not <em>create</em> computational capability; it <em>locates</em> pre-existing solutions on the Z[zeta_8] lattice.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>4. The Wall: Parity and the 100-Million-Quartet Search</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_45.html">Demo 45</a> extended forward DKC from XOR to all 13 non-trivial NPN equivalence classes of 3-input Boolean functions, discovering that topology frequency (how often a braid computes a given function, measured by forward enumeration) and decomposition quality (how well trained weights match bracket values, measured by reverse gauge-corrected RMS) are near-perfectly anti-correlated: Spearman rho = -0.82. Functions that topology produces frequently are precisely those whose trained weights decompose cleanly. This is the same computational structure measured from two independent directions.</p>
<p>One function stood alone: XNOR3 (parity) had topology frequency zero, reverse-decomposition RMS worse than random (0.996 vs 0.809 baseline), and under forward construction... nothing. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_46.html">Demo 46</a>'s per-neuron gauge correction (independent U(1) rotations per hidden neuron) improved parity's RMS from 0.77 to 0.57, but amplitude-only decomposition (0.33) still dramatically beat gauge-corrected phase matching — proving that split-sigmoid training produces weights whose magnitudes align with bracket magnitudes but whose phases are random relative to Z[zeta_8]. Phase decoherence, not gauge approximation, was the bottleneck.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">Demo 48</a> made the wall precise. An exhaustive search of 100,000,000 quartets (w1, w2, w3, bias) drawn from the 100-value Z[zeta_8] bracket catalog tested every combination under split-sigmoid activation. XNOR3 (parity) had exactly <strong>zero</strong> valid constructions. Every other NPN class had solutions — ranging from 127K for EXACT1 to 25M for AND2'. The wall was razor-thin: EXACT1 (truth table 0x16) is Hamming distance 1 from parity (0x69), with 127,000 solutions. The algebra gets within one bit flip of parity and cannot cross.</p>
<p>A four-tier hierarchy emerged: AND-type functions (&gt;10M solutions), intermediate functions (1-4M), boundary functions (127K-371K), and the single unreachable class (0 solutions). Three independent measures agreed: forward solution count correlates with topology frequency (rho = +0.78), anti-correlates with reverse RMS (rho = -0.79), and weakly correlates with orbit size (rho = +0.47). The bracket algebra has intrinsic computational structure, and parity sits exactly at its boundary.</p>
<p>The shape of this boundary would turn out to be geometric — a question of convexity in the complex plane — but that understanding required first testing the obvious escape routes (Section 5), then finding the real solution (Section 6), and finally proving the wall analytically (Section 8).</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>5. The Dead End: Neglecton Weights</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_49.html">Demo 49</a> tested the most natural hypothesis for breaking the wall: the radical of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. At delta=0, TL generators are nilpotent (e_i^2 = 0), and certain braids are "invisible" — their standard bracket (from single-loop states) is zero. First-order perturbation around delta=0 extracts contributions from two-loop states, yielding "neglecton" bracket values scaled by a factor of 4 = d(delta)/d(epsilon).</p>
<p>The enumeration produced 148 new Z[zeta_8] values from 15,242 previously invisible braids, expanding the catalog from 100 to 216 entries. The expanded catalog was searched exhaustively: 216^4 = 2.18 billion quartets. The result was unambiguous: parity still had exactly zero solutions. All 12 non-parity classes grew proportionally (~21x with the 21.8x larger search space), maintaining the same ranking. More precisely, the 116 genuinely new neglecton values all shared <em>angles</em> with existing standard values — they introduced new magnitudes but no new angular directions in the complex plane. The perturbation approach was closed at all orders, because higher-order terms (loops=3, 4, ...) produce the same A^(a-b) sums with real scaling factors that preserve the angular structure.</p>
<p>The wall was not in the weight space.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>6. The Breakthrough: MVN Activation and the Four-Tier Hierarchy</h2>
<p>If the lattice contains the right weights — and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_49.html">Demo 49</a> proved it does, since Aizenberg's known parity construction (w1=zeta_8, w2=i, w3=-1) lives in the Z[zeta_8] catalog — then the obstruction must be in how the activation function <em>reads</em> those weights.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_49.html">Demo 49</a> proved this analytically: a k=2 half-plane classifier cannot compute 3-input parity with <em>any</em> complex weights. The argument generalizes Minsky-Papert (1969) to the complex domain: if y1 and y2 both exceed a threshold d, then y1+y2 exceeds 2d &gt; d, contradicting parity's requirement that the sum of two "true" inputs produces "false." This is not merely an analogy — it is the genuine complex-valued extension of the perceptron limitation theorem, and it applies regardless of the weight lattice. The obstruction is geometric: half-planes are convex sets, and convex classification cannot implement non-monotone functions on additive inputs. Convexity, not algebraic structure, is the enemy.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">Demo 50</a> replaced split-sigmoid with k-sector MVN (Multi-Valued Neuron) classification: divide the complex plane into k angular sectors, assign output 0 or 1 to each sector based on parity (sector j mod 2). The same 100-value bracket catalog was searched for weight triples under each k from 2 to 8.</p>
<p>The result: parity is reachable at k=6 with <strong>906 solutions</strong>. All 13 NPN classes become computable. A four-tier hierarchy crystallized:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>k=2</strong> (half-plane): 5 classes — AND3', AND2', ~A~(BC), BUF, MAJ'</li>
<li><strong>k=3</strong>: +1 class — ~A(B^C)</li>
<li><strong>k=4</strong>: +6 classes — EXACT1, ISOLATE, 3v-0x19, 3v-0x1B, A^(B|C), XOR2</li>
<li><strong>k=6</strong>: +1 class — <strong>XNOR3 (parity)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Parity is uniquely isolated at the highest tier. The solution count is non-monotonic in k: 906 at k=6, 756 at k=7, 96 at k=8. This anti-correlates with gcd(k,8) — sector boundaries that misalign with the lattice's pi/4 angular structure break the symmetry that blocks parity. The incommensurability hypothesis: k=6 works because gcd(6,8)=2 provides maximal misalignment, while k=8 (gcd=8, perfect alignment with the lattice) has minimal solutions.</p>
<p>Anatomically, every parity solution obeys the <strong>triskelion principle</strong>: each of the 3 inputs requires its own odd sector, spaced at 120-degree intervals. All weights are confined to octants {2, 4, 5, 7} — the "class-1 angles" under k=6 sector mapping. Two octant-set combinations account for all 906 solutions: {2,5,7} (636 solutions, 70%) and {2,4,7} (270 solutions, 30%).</p>
<p>The wall was in the activation function. The lattice always had what parity needed; split-sigmoid could not read it.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>7. The Anatomy: Why the Wall Exists</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_51.html">Demo 51</a> computed the radical structure of TL_n(delta=0) for n=2 through 8 using exact integer arithmetic on planar matching diagrams. The key discovery: TL_3 is <em>semisimple</em> despite having nilpotent generators. e_1^2 = 0 and e_2^2 = 0, yet TL_3 decomposes cleanly as M_2(k) + k. The algebra is larger than its generators suggest. At n=2, TL_2(delta=0) = k[epsilon]/(epsilon^2) — the dual number algebra, the simplest non-semisimple case.</p>
<p>For even n &gt;= 4, the radical is non-trivial, and its structure revealed what <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_51.html">Demo 51</a> called the <strong>Sandwich Theorem</strong>: TL_{2k}(delta=0) has Loewy length exactly 3 — three layers: Top (isomorphic to TL_{2k-1}(0), which is semisimple), Middle (the novel part), and Bottom (also isomorphic to TL_{2k-1}(0)). The top and bottom are dimensional mirrors. The Peirce block structure of rad^2 matches TL_{2k-1}(0) exactly for k=2,3,4 (checked at n=4,6,8 against n=3,5,7).</p>
<p>All nonzero fixed-point counts in the trace form are Catalan numbers — the <strong>Catalan Trace Theorem</strong>, with a precise window formula: at each n, the nonzero values are exactly {C_m : floor(n/2)+1 &lt;= m &lt;= n}.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_38.html">Demo 38</a> proved a dimension reduction theorem: at delta=0, the Gram matrix of the TL trace form has rank C_{n-1} at even n (full rank C_n at odd n), meaning the bracket factors through a quotient TL_n(0)/rad isomorphic to TL_{n-1}(0) — an asymptotic 4x dimension reduction. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_39.html">Demo 39</a> decomposed TL_n by through-strand count into cellular sectors, verifying that sector sizes equal d(n,j)^2 (the Graham-Lehrer cell module dimensions), proving the cell filtration property exhaustively, and discovering that even semisimple TL algebras are NOT block-diagonal in the standard basis. It also mapped the Gram rank at multiple delta values (0, 1, sqrt(2), phi), showing how the radical erodes rank differently at each evaluation point.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_52.html">Demo 52</a> generalized to all roots of unity (ell=2 through 6), discovering that rad^3 = 0 <em>universally</em> — the <strong>Universal Nilpotency 3 Conjecture</strong>. This was initially surprising (PIM theory predicts Loewy length up to 2<em>ell-1), but the resolution is elegant: Graham-Lehrer's cellularity of TL algebras forces Loewy length &lt;= 3 for cellular algebras where cell-module bilinear forms have rad^2 = 0. Cross-ell radical dimension formulas emerged: rad(TL_ell) = 2</em>ell - 3, and rad(TL_{ell+1}) = ell^2 - ell - 3. The total bilinear rank of the rad^2 generator follows Fibonacci numbers: F(ell-1) at each ell. This connects entanglement rank of the thermal ground state to anyonic computational power — the deeper explanation for why Fibonacci anyons (ell=5) are better for quantum computing.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_60.html">Demo 60</a> extended the radical anatomy to the first cubic number field: at ell=7 (delta=2cos(pi/7), root of x^3-x^2-2x+1=0), every formula from the quadratic cases held exactly — rad(TL_7) = 11 = 2*7-3, rad(TL_8) = 39 = 49-7-3, rad^2 = 1-dimensional, nilpotency = 3, and Fibonacci rank = F(6) = 8 with sector decomposition 3+4+1+0. The number field degree does not matter. The radical structure is universal.</p>
<p>The non-semisimple structure of TL at roots of unity is <em>why</em> the bracket has computational limitations. Bracket evaluation factors through TL/radical (the semisimple quotient), killing exactly the radical degrees of freedom. Those degrees of freedom are what parity needs. The activation function either reads them (MVN, which accesses angular information from the full cyclotomic ring) or doesn't (split-sigmoid, which projects to amplitudes and discards phase).</p>
<p>Crucially, the radical anatomy is not just an after-the-fact explanation of the wall — it is <em>predictive</em>. The dimension of the radical at each n determines how many degrees of freedom are lost in the semisimple quotient. The Fibonacci rank theorem (rad^2 generator rank = F(ell-1)) means that at ell=2, only F(1)=1 degree of freedom supports the sandwich layer. The radical structure predicts which functions will be hard before the exhaustive search confirms it: functions requiring non-convex decision boundaries are precisely those that need the radical's angular degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>8. The Universality: Cross-Level Exploration</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_53.html">Demos 53</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_59.html">59</a> extended DKC to five evaluation levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ell=3</strong> (delta=1, percolation): Bracket values in Z[omega] (Eisenstein integers). Only 6 distinct values. Binary collapse — too sparse for meaningful computation.</li>
<li><strong>ell=4</strong> (delta=sqrt(2), Ising): Z[zeta_16] with Z[i]-axiality. 56 catalog values. Re&gt;0 multiplicative encoding reaches 11/13 NPN classes.</li>
<li><strong>ell=5</strong> (delta=phi, Fibonacci anyons): Z[zeta_5], rank 4, fully populated. 116+ values. Re&gt;0 still reaches 11/13.</li>
<li><strong>ell=6</strong> (delta=sqrt(3), Q=3 Potts): Z[zeta_24], rank 8. Re&gt;0 still 11/13.</li>
<li><strong>ell=infinity</strong> (delta=0): Z[zeta_8] with strict axiality. 100 values. Re&gt;0+additive reaches 12/13 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">Demo 48</a>); MVN k=6 reaches 13/13 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">Demo 50</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>11/13 Re&gt;0 wall</strong> held at every evaluation level tested. The same two NPN classes — 0x06 (XOR-AND) and 0x1B (CROSS) — were unreachable regardless of the underlying cyclotomic ring. The wall is ring-independent and activation-structural.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_61.html">Demo 61</a> proved this computationally via exhaustive integer-arithmetic search (46.7 million angle triples at N=360 with 8 boundary orientations each). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_62.html">Demo 62</a> provided clean algebraic proofs:</p>
<p><strong>0x1B (CROSS)</strong> — a 3-step interval-squeeze contradiction. Setting theta=0, writing phi2=pi+x and phi3=y, three constraints force simultaneously 2pi-x-y &lt;= phi1 (from phi1+phi2+phi3 outside the semicircle) and phi1 &lt; pi-x (from phi1+phi2 outside). These combine to require pi &lt; y, but y = phi3 &lt; pi. Contradiction.</p>
<p><strong>0x06 (XOR-AND)</strong> — a four-semicircle parallelogram argument. The constraint structure requires phi1 to avoid four semicircles whose midpoints form a parallelogram on the circle. The key inequality alpha+beta &gt; pi (forced by phi2+phi3 outside the semicircle) makes all four gaps between consecutive midpoints less than pi. The intersection of four semicircles is non-empty iff some gap &gt;= pi. Since all gaps &lt; pi, the intersection is empty.</p>
<p>The two proofs have different structures: 0x06's obstruction is local (additive triple conflicts), while 0x1B's is global (no local conflicts, but a system-level impossibility). Yet both stem from the same root — the additive structure of multiplicative encoding (angles add: z = w1^a <em> w2^b </em> w3^c implies angle(z) = a<em>phi1 + b</em>phi2 + c*phi3) creates constraints that half-planes cannot satisfy for these specific truth tables.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_57.html">Demo 57</a>'s convexity thesis unified the picture: the wall is about activation convexity, not encoding geometry. Half-planes are convex; additive sums preserve convexity; multiplicative products can rotate out of convex regions (anti-convex). Non-convex activations (split-sigmoid, sector) bypass the wall with either encoding.</p>
<p>Axiality itself showed a hierarchy across levels. At ell=2 (delta=0), bracket values are strictly 1D-axial in Z[zeta_8] — at most one nonzero component out of four. At ell=4 (delta=sqrt(2)), they are 2D Z[i]-axial. At ell=5 (delta=phi), all four basis coordinates of Z[zeta_5] are populated. The decoherence rate (radical proportion of the algebra) decreases: 60% at ell=3, 36% at ell=4, 17% at ell=5, 7% at ell=6. Higher ell means less decoherence, more stable coherent sector.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>9. The Four Pillars</h2>
<p>DKC sits at an unoccupied intersection of four established fields. No paper in any of these fields cites papers from the other three.</p>
<p><strong>Habiro (2002)</strong> — <em>bracket values are cyclotomic integers.</em> The colored Jones polynomial has a cyclotomic expansion. Evaluating at any root of unity produces a value in the appropriate cyclotomic integer ring. This is the mathematical guarantee that the weight catalog consists of algebraic integers with exact arithmetic, not floating-point approximations.</p>
<p><strong>Nazer-Gastpar (2011)</strong> — <em>algebraic integer lattices support exact computation.</em> In compute-and-forward relay networks, relays should compute integer linear combinations of codewords rather than decode individually. Lattice codes (closed under integer linear combination) do the computational heavy lifting. DKC applies the same principle with a twist: compute-and-forward computes linear functions; DKC computes nonlinear functions through bracket evaluation. But the foundational insight is shared — algebraic ring closure guarantees correctness.</p>
<p><strong>Abramsky (2007)</strong> — <em>TL diagrams encode computation.</em> The Temperley-Lieb algebra connects knot theory, categorical quantum mechanics, and logic via a "planar lambda calculus." TL diagrams are a natural computational calculus — composition of diagrams is composition of computations. The bracket state sum evaluates this calculus. Forward DKC's step from "TL diagrams encode computation" to "bracket values of TL diagrams serve as NN weights" builds directly on Abramsky's bridge.</p>
<p><strong>Aizenberg (2000)</strong> — <em>roots-of-unity neurons for discrete logic.</em> The k-th roots of unity encode k-valued logic. A single multi-valued neuron with k angular sectors implements arbitrary k-valued threshold functions. Aizenberg <em>prescribes</em> root-of-unity structure by design; forward DKC <em>discovers</em> that bracket values (sums of roots of unity by Habiro's theorem) naturally compute Boolean functions when used as MVN weights. The convergence of prescribed and emergent structure is the core DKC result.</p>
<p>The assembly is: <code></code>` Abramsky:       TL diagrams encode computation     |           (evaluate via state sum) Habiro:         bracket values are cyclotomic integers     |           (use as neural network weights) Aizenberg:      roots-of-unity neurons compute Boolean functions     |           (ring structure guarantees exactness) Nazer-Gastpar:  algebraic integer lattices support exact computation <code></code>`</p>
<p>Each step is grounded in established mathematics. The assembly is novel.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>9.5. The Proof Trilogy: Radical, Markov, and Angular Anatomy</h2>
<p>Three formal proofs now anchor the algebraic side of DKC.</p>
<p><strong>Proof 1: Radical Dimension Formula</strong> (<code>proofs/radical-dimension-formula.md</code>). rad(TL_ell) = 2ell-3. The unique degenerate cell module V_{ell-2} has corank 1, determined by the Chebyshev zero U_{ell-1}(cos(pi/ell)) = 0. This is the "algebraic light" — the fixpt trace sees everything except the radical.</p>
<p><strong>Proof 2: Next-Level Radical Formula</strong> (<code>proofs/next-level-radical-formula.md</code>). rad(TL_{ell+1}) = ell^2-ell-3. At n=ell+1, V_{ell-3} is the unique new degenerate module, again with corank 1 via the linking theorem. The Universal Corank 1 property at first degeneracy is structural, not numerical.</p>
<p><strong>Proof 3: Markov RT Truncation</strong> (<code>proofs/markov-rt-truncation.md</code>). dim ker(B_M) = dim J(A) + sum of (dim L_j)^2 for j &gt;= ell-1. The Markov trace kills exactly the Reshetikhin-Turaev truncated modules (j &gt;= ell-1), preserving only the "physical" modules (j &lt;= ell-2). This is the "topological light" — dimmer than the algebraic light by exactly the RT-truncated blocks. The shadow interpretation: fixpt trace = algebraic light (sees all simples), Markov trace = topological light (sees only RT-physical modules). The excess = what topology cannot see that algebra can.</p>
<p>Discovery path: the wrong conjecture ((ell+m-1)^2+1 for the excess) was essential — it worked for small m and failed at m=3, revealing the true block-sum structure. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_39.html">Demo 39</a> Parts G-J provided the computational verification (31/31 data points); <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_63.html">Demo 63</a> uses the RT truncation connection to explain why DKC works at delta=0.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>10. The Wall Under a Microscope</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">Demos 64</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">65</a> zoomed in on the XOR6 impossibility — not just confirming it, but anatomizing its two-layer structure and extending the parity matroid hierarchy.</p>
<h3>The Funnel-Shaped Matroid (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">Demo 64</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">Demo 64</a> established that the DKC parity hierarchy {XOR2, XOR3, XOR4, XOR5} is a genuine matroid minor chain with 100% downward deletion-contraction closure: deleting any weight from an XOR_n solution always yields an XOR_{n-1} solution, and contracting any input to 1 always yields an XNOR_{n-1} solution. This is a verified theorem at all levels.</p>
<p>But the upward direction tells a different story. Coverage collapses sharply: XOR3→XOR2: 99.3%, XOR4→XOR3: 39.2%, XOR5→XOR4: 19.2%, XOR6→XOR5: 0%. The n=6 wall casts its shadow downward — 80% of XOR4 weight sets are already dead ends that can never extend to XOR5. The hierarchy is funnel-shaped, wide at the bottom and collapsing to a point.</p>
<p>The vocabulary splits into 44 "good" values (appear in extensible solutions at every level) and 31 "poison" values (appear only in orphan solutions that cannot be extended). The wall's minimum Hamming distance is 4 — no XOR6 candidate achieves fewer than 4 errors. Crucially, zero errors occur at input weight 0 or 1; the obstruction is purely pairwise and above. This is the <strong>self-doubling impossibility theorem</strong>: any weight equal to an existing weight always fails because scalar doubling preserves the angle, and a class-1 angle doubled remains class-1, contradicting the required class-0 output for even-parity input weight. This mechanism accounts for 89.5% of all closest misses.</p>
<p>A second layer of obstruction exists beyond the pairwise wall: cases at d=7 and d=8 with zero broken pairs but weight-3+ errors — higher-order (GHZ-type) interactions that have no clean pairwise explanation.</p>
<h3>The Two-Layer Wall (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">Demo 65</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">Demo 64</a> conjectured that XOR6 might become achievable at Z[zeta_16] (the next cyclotomic ring, one rung up the Clifford hierarchy). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">Demo 65</a> answered this — and the answer was more nuanced than a simple yes or no.</p>
<p>Under <strong>standard</strong> k-sector activation (odd sectors labeled 1, even labeled 0), the parity ceiling is identical at Z[zeta_8] and Z[zeta_16]. Tier thresholds — XOR3 at k=6, XOR4 at k=8, XOR5 at k=14 — are exactly the same. XOR6 has zero solutions at every k from 2 to 31, in both rings, at both the base catalog (36 Z[zeta_16] values) and an extended catalog (+20 from 4-strand braids). The "gap-of-2" hypothesis (pigeonhole bound minus ceiling should be constant) is <strong>refuted</strong>: at Z[zeta_8] the gap is 2 (pigeonhole 7, ceiling 5); at Z[zeta_16] the gap widens to 9 (pigeonhole 14, ceiling still 5).</p>
<p>But under <strong>generalized</strong> activation — testing all possible binary labelings of k sectors, not just the standard odd/even convention — the wall breaks at k=24. Exactly 3 of 2,700 candidate (XOR5-set, extension-weight) pairs admit a binary coloring of 24 sectors that realizes XOR6. All three consist of exactly 3 antipodal pairs; all have exactly zero margin to the sector boundary (algebraic exactness throughout). XOR7 first appears at k=91 under generalized activation.</p>
<p>This reveals a <strong>two-layer wall structure</strong>: an absolute geometric layer (k≤23, zero solutions regardless of any labeling convention) and a labeling-convention layer (k≥24, breakable by choosing the right coloring). The near-threshold even/odd k pattern (even k works, odd k fails) reflects the pi/4 lattice alignment of Z[zeta_8]. The k=24 threshold is not arbitrary — it is confirmed in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">Demo 66</a> as a projection of the 24-cell's 24 vertices onto S¹.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>11. The Quaternionic-Spherical Arc</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">Demos 66</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">71</a> constitute a six-demo arc lifting DKC from the complex plane (S¹) to the full geometry of SU(2), and then using that geometry to explain why 13 directions, 14 cells, and bandwidth l=6 are the same number.</p>
<h3>The 24-Cell Polytope (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">Demo 66</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">Demo 65</a>'s k=24 threshold prompted the natural question: why 24? <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">Demo 66</a> answered it by lifting the Kauffman bracket from scalar trace (S¹) to full unit quaternion (S³). SU(2) braid representations with generators sigma_1 → (1+i)/sqrt(2) and sigma_2 → (1-k)/sqrt(2) produce, from 87,890 enumerated braids, exactly <strong>24 distinct unit quaternions</strong> — the vertices of the 24-cell polytope, the unique self-dual regular 4-polytope. These decompose into 4 axis-aligned, 12 edge-midpoint, and 8 body-diagonal vertices; the 48 elements with negatives form the binary octahedral group.</p>
<p>The bracket and quaternion are complementary projections, not redundant. Of 124,750 braid pairs, 80% differ on both; only 13% agree on both. The quaternion resolves 8,424 bracket collisions; the bracket resolves 450 quaternion collisions.</p>
<p>The key computational result: restricting to 3 antipodal pairs from the 24 vertices and assigning subset sums to their nearest 24-cell Voronoi cell (25 cells: 24 vertices + 1 zero cell) yields <strong>35 XOR6 solutions</strong> — more than the 64-cell geographic grid. Every solution shows the universal 7/7/11 structure: exactly 7 cells labeled 0, 7 labeled 1, 11 unused. Under the 576-element F4 symmetry group of the 24-cell, the 35 solutions fall into 6 orbits in two families: edge-dominant (22 solutions) and body-dominant (13 solutions). The complex S¹ minimum of k=24 is confirmed as a projection of the 24-cell's 24 vertices onto S¹ via the trace.</p>
<h3>The Computation Lives on S² (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">Demo 67</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">Demo 66</a> showed XOR6 on S³. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">Demo 67</a> asked: which projection of S³ actually carries the computational information? The Hopf fibration S³ → S² with fiber S¹ decomposes each unit quaternion into a rotation axis (S² base) and a phase (S¹ fiber). The question is empirical: which part matters?</p>
<p>The answer is unambiguous. A custom 13-direction Voronoi on S² — derived from the 13 distinct eigenvector directions of the 24 quaternions (mod ±) — achieves <strong>36 solutions at only 14 cells</strong>, beating the 25-cell S³ Voronoi's 35 solutions while using fewer cells. Meanwhile, <strong>Hopf phase-only activation yields zero solutions at every resolution tested</strong> (k=4 through k=32). The Hopf phase is computationally inert. All DKC information lives in the S² base.</p>
<p>No Platonic solid captures this: octahedral (6 cells), icosahedral (12 cells), and cuboctahedral (12 cells) Voronois all yield zero XOR6 solutions. The 13 eigenvector directions are data-intrinsic, not geometrically natural, and their Voronoi is more efficient than any a priori polyhedral partition.</p>
<p>The progression across the arc: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a> S¹ needs k=24 (25 cells); <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a> S³ needs 25 cells; <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a> S² needs 14 cells. The 2D projection is the most efficient encoding.</p>
<h3>The Plane as Window (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_68.html">Demo 68</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_68.html">Demo 68</a> applied stereographic projection to map the eigenvector S² into R², asking whether the computation could be performed in the plane. The answer is half yes, half no. Using the S² great-circle metric for nearest-neighbor assignment in R² gives 36 solutions at 14 cells — an exact match to <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">Demo 67</a>. Switching to Euclidean distance collapses solutions to zero. The 16.5× area distortion from stereographic projection breaks cell boundaries when Euclidean distance is used, but conformality (angle preservation) is sufficient when the S² metric is maintained.</p>
<p>The computational conclusion: "Visualize on the plane, compute on the sphere." The stereographic picture is a valid ASCII drawing of a DKC computation — each of the 36 winners renders as a visible 0/1 domain map in a 65×33 grid — but the plane is a window into curved geometry, not a replacement for it. The decision boundary is intrinsically curved.</p>
<h3>ζ_8 as the Computational Sweet Spot (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">Demo 69</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">Demo 69</a> compared the eigenvector geometry across ζ<em>8, ζ_16, and ζ_32 and proved the <strong>Direction Nesting Theorem</strong>: for any N, all eigenvector directions in the ζ_N catalog appear identically in the ζ</em>{2N} catalog. The nesting is algebraically forced — squaring a quaternion (ζ<em>N → ζ</em>{2N}) preserves its rotation axis — and confirmed computationally for ζ_8 → ζ_16 at exactly 13/13 directions with 0.000° angular drift.</p>
<p>ζ_8 is the <strong>computational sweet spot</strong>: the coarsest cyclotomic root that produces the structured 13-direction geometry. Finer roots nest it exactly (gaining no new directions relative to the ground structure) but their natural Voronoi resolutions trivialize the computation entirely. At ζ_16 with 3,457 directions and a 3,457-cell Voronoi, 90.6% of all XOR6 triples become solutions — pigeonhole statistics dominate topology. At ζ_32 the figure is 89.6%. The musical temperament analogy: ζ_8 is 13-note equal temperament where each solution is meaningful; ζ_16 is 3,457 microtones where consonance is trivially achieved.</p>
<p>The <strong>trivialization threshold</strong> — where computation transitions from topology-driven to pigeonhole-dominated — lies between roughly 50 and 500 Voronoi cells, not yet precisely located.</p>
<h3>Music and Space (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_70.html">Demo 70</a>)</h3>
<p>The 4 eigenvalue angles of the binary octahedral group (0°, 45°, 60°, 90°) map exactly to 4 musical notes: C (unison), Eb (minor 3rd), E (major 3rd), F# (tritone). The trace descends from maximum consonance (C, 2.000) to maximum dissonance (F#, 0.000). Braid words become melodies — each crossing yields the eigenvalue angle of the running quaternion product — and the Yang-Baxter relation sigma_1 sigma_2 sigma_1 = sigma_2 sigma_1 sigma_2 produces <strong>identical melodies step-by-step</strong>: topological equivalence is melodic equivalence.</p>
<p>Music (eigenvalue/pitch) and space (eigenvector/position) are <strong>orthogonal</strong>: Pearson r = -0.062 over 253 pairs. The two projections of a unit quaternion — what note it plays and where on S² its rotation axis points — carry independent information. This confirms the Hopf fibration finding from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">Demo 67</a>: the computationally relevant S² base and the computationally inert fiber are literally two orthogonal dimensions of the algebraic structure.</p>
<p>The tritone-antipodal correspondence emerges naturally on the dodecahedron: antipodal faces carry tritone pairs (C/F#, G/Db, D/Ab, etc.), so dissonance IS the antipodal map. Yet dodecahedral and icosahedral Voronois yield zero XOR6 solutions — the wrong symmetry group (icosahedral, order 120) cannot replicate results from the binary octahedral group (order 48).</p>
<h3>The 13=13 Theorem (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">Demo 71</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">Demo 71</a> closed the arc with a spectral explanation of why 13 directions, 14 cells, and XOR6 belong together.</p>
<p>Spherical harmonic decomposition of the XOR6 Voronoi labeling function on S² reveals a <strong>sharp phase transition at bandwidth l=6</strong>: 0% of winning solutions are recoverable at l≤5; 100% are recoverable at l=6. The threshold is all-or-nothing, not gradual. Mode l=6 concentrates approximately 80.7% of the power on average across all 36 winners (range: 70–84%), with l=4 and l=12 as minor secondary modes. This spectral shape is a <strong>structural invariant</strong> — all 36 solutions share it, with variation concentrated only in l=2.</p>
<p>The explanation is the <strong>13=13 Theorem</strong>: spherical harmonic mode l has (2l+1) independent components. At l=5 there are 11 components trying to address 13 distinct regions — underdetermined, zero recovery. At l=6 there are exactly 13 components for 13 regions — determined. The phase transition is at the exact degrees-of-freedom boundary.</p>
<p>This predicts trivialization as well. For ζ_16 with 3,457 directions, the formula requires l≥1728 (2×1728+1=3,457). At such enormous bandwidth, any coarse partition trivially resolves the computation, explaining <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">Demo 69</a>'s 90% solution rate from a completely different (spectral rather than statistical) direction.</p>
<p>The compression result: 14 Voronoi cells suffice where Nyquist sampling theory on S² predicts (6+1)²=49 cells. The 3.5× compression is an instance of <strong>compressed sensing on S²</strong> — binary function at known support positions, so sparsity plus known support eliminates the generic sampling requirement. The Voronoi cells need only distinguish 13 directions from each other, not generically sample an arbitrary l=6 function.</p>
<p>The musical connection lands at the end of the arc: the XOR6 computation lives at mode l=6, corresponding to 200 cents (note D, a whole tone). This is one step above the tritone (l=2, F#) that spans the eigenvalue range. The computation requires higher angular frequency than the eigenvalue geometry itself provides — a subtle layering of the algebraic and spectral structure.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>12. The Characterization Arc: What S² DKC Actually Is</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">Demos 66</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">71</a> established that DKC lives on S² — that the computation is carried by the eigenvector direction of the quaternion sum, not the complex scalar trace, and that 13 algebraically selected directions on the sphere suffice for XOR6. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">Demos 72</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">75</a> asked the harder question: what does that <em>mean</em>, and what kind of mathematical object is it?</p>
<h3>Algebra Beats Geometry: The Anti-Correlation Theorem (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">Demo 72</a>)</h3>
<p>The 13 eigenvector directions that compute XOR6 are beautiful algebraically — they are the distinct rotation axes of the binary octahedral group — but they are geometrically terrible. They fail the spherical t-design property at l=1: their centroid is off-origin, and they only happen to pass at l=2 (to machine precision, likely from a hidden quadrupole symmetry). The first genuine failure relevant to DKC is at l=4 (residual 0.576). They are, formally, a t=0 design — the worst possible for integration.</p>
<p>This provokes the question: what if you replaced these algebraically-selected directions with ones that are better distributed geometrically? Stochastic optimization finds a 13-point configuration with 2.6× better design residual. XOR6 solutions: 4. Against the eigenvectors' 36.</p>
<p>Better geometry destroys the computation. The <strong>Anti-Correlation Theorem</strong> holds: sampling quality and computational quality are anti-correlated for this configuration. This is because DKC is algebraic, not geometric — the 13 directions are selected by the binary octahedral group acting on Z[ζ_8] quaternions, and they work because of specific angular relationships, not uniform distribution. Moving the points to "better" positions breaks the Voronoi partition structure that XOR6 needs. The compressed sensing and DOF mechanisms that explain why 13 points suffice (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">Demo 71</a>'s 2×6+1=13 argument) require those specific 13 points, not just any 13.</p>
<p>Robustness tests confirm the algebraic sharpness: the computation holds through ~5° perturbation (mean 35.8 of 36 solutions) and collapses at 10° (mean 11.5). The placement is sharp to roughly the angular size of a Voronoi cell.</p>
<h3>DKC is Additive, Not Multiplicative: The 82.8% Universal Constant (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">Demo 73</a>)</h3>
<p>The eigenvector Voronoi partition on S² defines a 13-state space. Inputs get accumulated into a running quaternion sum, and each step maps the current state to the next via the Voronoi assignment of the updated sum. Is this a finite automaton?</p>
<p>Almost. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">Demo 73</a> shows that under the <em>additive</em> formulation (sum weights, read Voronoi cell of sum), 82.8% of cell transitions are deterministic — a specific input bit in a specific current cell always produces the same next cell. The remaining 17.2% arise from non-determinism: the Voronoi cell captures the eigenvector <em>direction</em> (the compass) but discards the eigenvalue angle and magnitude (the odometer). Two partial sums can be in the same cell but produce different cells when the same weight is added, because their magnitudes or angles differ.</p>
<p>The <strong>multiplicative</strong> formulation fails entirely: the braid product σ₁^±1·σ₂^±1·...·σ₂^±1 assigns exactly 8 even-parity and 8 odd-parity inputs to <em>every</em> final cell. The product cannot compute XOR6 at all. The reason is algebraic: flipping all bits maps M → M⁻¹, which shares the same eigenvector cell as M (antipodal identification), but changes parity. Multiplicative accumulation is blind to parity by symmetry.</p>
<p>What makes this result striking is that 82.8% is a <strong>universal structural constant</strong>: all 36 winning triples have exactly 48/58 deterministic transitions (to the significant digit shown). Zero variation. This follows from the binary octahedral group acting transitively on the 13 directions — the combinatorial collision structure is identical across all triples. The computation is invariant under the symmetry group that defines its weight space.</p>
<p>A 27-cell signed partition (no antipodal identification) increases determinism to 87.1% but still falls short of 100%. Full determinism would require tracking magnitude modulo the weight lattice, which demands infinitely many states — the "odometer reading" that the current architecture deliberately discards. The DKC computation is an almost-automaton: a compass without an odometer.</p>
<h3>Bracket and Cell are Incomparable Invariants: Six Computational Types (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">Demo 74</a>)</h3>
<p>The Kauffman bracket and the DKC Voronoi cell are both braid invariants — functions that are constant on certain equivalence classes of braids. Are they related? Does one refine the other?</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">Demo 74</a> proves they are <strong>incomparable</strong>: neither subsumes the other. At the braid level (analyzing 2,000 braids, 1.1 million pairs), the cell separates 97.8% of bracket collisions — pairs with the same bracket value that land in different Voronoi cells. The remaining 2.2% are pairs with the same eigenvector direction but different eigenvalue angle, precisely the information the cell discards. Conversely, the bracket separates 54% of cell collisions. Neither invariant refines the other; they capture orthogonal information.</p>
<p>The combination is strictly finer: (bracket, cell) yields 119 equivalence classes versus 100 for bracket alone and 14 for cell alone — a 19% improvement that represents genuinely new information. The bracket is a trace (collapses to a scalar), and the cell is an eigenvector projection (collapses to a direction); these two operations discard complementary aspects of the full quaternion.</p>
<p>Among the 14 cells, only <strong>6 distinct computational types</strong> exist. When all 36 winning triples vote on which parity label each cell gets, the 14 cells fall into 6 symmetry classes corresponding to the orbits of the binary octahedral group: the two axis orbits (σ₁-axis, σ₂-axis), a third axis, the body-diagonal cells, the edge cells, and the identity. The DKC computation is invariant under permutation within each orbit. 92% of winning triples actively use the cell's extra resolving power — they separate braid pairs that the bracket treats as equal. The computation is exploiting geometric information the algebraic invariant cannot see.</p>
<h3>Angle Subsumes Cell; √n Magnitudes; Multiplicative Channel Blind (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">Demo 75</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">Demo 74</a> characterized the bracket and cell as incomparable at the level of individual catalog quaternions. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">Demo 75</a> turns to <em>sum</em> quaternions — the actual objects that appear in DKC computation — and discovers a different structure.</p>
<p>For additive weight sums, the <strong>angle subsumes the cell</strong>: the eigenvalue rotation angle of the sum quaternion perfectly predicts parity for all 36 winning triples. Every angle value maps to exactly one parity bit, with zero ambiguity. The 13-cell Voronoi assignment is a coarsening of the angle assignment; it carries no information beyond what the angle already encodes at computation time. The sum produces exactly 7 distinct eigenvalue angles: 0°, 30°, 35.264° (tetrahedral), 45°, 60°, 65.905°, 90°. Three of these (30°, 35.264°, 65.905°) are <strong>non-canonical</strong> — they do not appear in any individual catalog quaternion, because quaternion addition breaks the 24-cell group closure and produces vectors not in the group.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the sum is algebraically quantized: |S|² is always an integer from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. The value √5 is unreachable — it would require an inner product not achievable from the half-integer inner products of the 24-cell ({-1, -½, 0, ½, 1}). The six magnitude values have entropy 1.839 bits, but magnitude alone predicts parity in only 44% of winning triples.</p>
<p>The <strong>multiplicative channel</strong> — the quaternion <em>product</em> of all weights rather than their sum — has more total entropy (4.241 bits), covers all 13 Voronoi cells, but produces zero XOR6 solutions. The multiplicative channel is computation-blind because it stays inside the 24-cell group (only 4 canonical angles appear) and symmetric under parity flip (M → M⁻¹ maps to the same eigenvector cell). The non-canonical angles that make additive computation work arise precisely because addition breaks the group structure. Breaking the group is not a flaw — it is the mechanism.</p>
<p>The characterization arc thus resolves: DKC is an additive operation on a quaternionic lattice, exploiting group-breaking in vector sums to produce non-canonical angles that encode parity. The cell is a coarse readout; the angle is the fine readout; neither the bracket nor any single geometric invariant fully captures the computation. It is something new.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>13. The Scaling Arc: Can DKC Scale Beyond 6 Inputs?</h2>
<p>The characterization arc settled what XOR6 DKC is. The scaling arc asked whether the structure generalizes. Can you compute XOR8, XOR10, XOR12 with the same machinery? Is the Z[ζ_8] lattice just a special case, or does DKC scale?</p>
<h3>The First Wall: XOR8 = 0 at S² Voronoi (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">Demo 76</a>)</h3>
<p>The most direct approach is to extend the 6-input construction: select 4 weights from the 24-element ζ_8 catalog and search for XOR8 solutions using the same 14-cell S² Voronoi activation that resolved XOR6. Exhaustive search over all C(24,4) = 10,626 quadruples finds zero solutions. The best achievable accuracy is 50% — random chance.</p>
<p>The failure has a clean information-theoretic diagnosis. At 6 inputs, 64 masks distributed among 14 cells is ~4.6 masks per cell — sparse enough for parity-pure cell assignment. At 8 inputs, 256 masks among 14 cells is ~18.3 masks per cell — parity-pure cells are geometrically impossible by pigeonhole. The S² Voronoi at ζ_8 is exhausted. The 14-cell partition does not have the resolution to separate 256 masks.</p>
<p>The algebraic structure also fragments: 3-term weight sums produce 7 discrete eigenvalue angles (algebraic, clean). 4-term sums produce 86 nearly-continuous angles (values like 7.861°, 9.736°), and the √n magnitude quantization collapses from 6 clean values to 28 including non-algebraic floats. The clean structure that enables 6-input DKC loses its discreteness at 8 inputs under this formulation.</p>
<p>But this is where the scaling arc learns its first lesson: a wall hit by one activation function is not a wall.</p>
<h3>Breaking the First Wall: Activation, Not Root of Unity (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">Demo 77</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">Demo 50</a> showed that parity (3-input XOR) was unreachable under split-sigmoid but computable at k=6 MVN sectors — the wall was the activation, not the lattice. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">Demo 77</a> repeats this discovery one level up.</p>
<p>Under <strong>combined Sec(8) × Voronoi activation</strong> — binning the eigenvalue angle into 8 sectors (S¹) and the eigenvector into 14 Voronoi cells (S²), giving 112 total cells — XOR8 is computable at ζ_8 with exactly <strong>6 winning quadruples</strong>. The phase transition between 0 and non-zero solutions occurs between 84 cells (k=6 sectors, 0 winners) and 112 cells (k=8 sectors, 6 winners). The S¹ component is computationally necessary: sector activation alone at k=16 (16 cells) achieves zero XOR8 solutions at 96.9% accuracy; S² Voronoi alone achieves 50%. Both channels are required.</p>
<p>This is not coincidental — <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">Demo 74</a> proved that bracket (eigenvalue angle) and cell (eigenvector direction) are <em>incomparable</em> invariants. The incomparability is computationally load-bearing: XOR8 requires both pieces of information simultaneously, and neither channel can stand in for the other. The combined S¹ × S² activation is the quaternionic generalization of Aizenberg's MVN: reading both the angle and the direction of a unit quaternion rather than just its complex argument.</p>
<p>The 6 winning quadruples share a remarkable structural property: every one contains exactly one <strong>paired quaternion</strong> — a catalog entry that shares the same eigenvector direction as another entry in the tuple but has a different eigenvalue angle. Remove either member of the pair and you get a valid XOR6 triple. Every XOR8 winner is an XOR6 winner plus one "shadow" that extends it by providing additional angle resolution. The paired structure is exact: 12 of the 24 embedded triples from the 6 winning quadruples are XOR6 winners (50%).</p>
<p>The conclusion mirrors <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">Demo 50</a>: ζ_8 with S¹ × S² activation supports at least 8-input computation. The root of unity did not impose the wall; the activation did.</p>
<h3>The Second Wall: XOR10 = 0 at ζ_8 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">Demo 78</a>)</h3>
<p>Does the recursive shadow structure extend to XOR10? <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">Demo 78</a> searches exhaustively: all C(24,5) = 42,504 quintuples under every tested activation (k=8, 10, 12, 16 sector counts). Zero XOR10 winners at any activation.</p>
<p>The best accuracy is 98.4% — 1008 of 1024 masks correct, 16 masks wrong — but not 100%. The non-monotonicity pattern from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">Demo 50</a> reappears: k=12 accuracy (96.9%) is worse than k=10 (98.4%), because the pi/4 incommensurability of the ζ_8 lattice creates destructive interference at specific sector counts, just as <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">Demo 50</a> found 906 solutions at k=6, 756 at k=7, 96 at k=8 for 3-input parity.</p>
<p>The diagnosis: the binary octahedral group has exactly 24 elements, 13 distinct eigenvector directions, and 2 distinct eigenvalue half-angles (45° and 90°). Selecting 5 entries from 24 exhausts the structural diversity of this group. There are not enough distinct algebraic "voices" in the ζ_8 catalog to compute XOR10. The wall this time is in the root of unity — or more precisely, in the <strong>finiteness</strong> of the group it generates.</p>
<h3>Breaking the Second Wall: ζ_12 and the Infinite Group (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">Demo 79</a>)</h3>
<p>At ζ_8, the SU(2) subgroup generated by the standard two-generator braid construction closes at 24 elements after 4 rounds. At ζ_12 (rotation angle π/6), the same construction generates a group that roughly doubles each round: 5 → 17 → 51 → 127 → 275 → 564 → 1140 → 2292 → 4096+. It has not closed by 4096 entries. It appears to be infinite (or extremely large finite).</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">Demo 79</a> tests XOR capacity at ζ_12. XOR10 goes from 0 (at ζ_8) to <strong>124 winners</strong> at ζ_12 with a 256-entry catalog. XOR12 is solvable: 50+ winners found from an expanded 4096-entry catalog. XOR6 and XOR8 each produce 1024+ winners (search cap hit). The wall that blocked ζ_8 at XOR10 does not exist for ζ_12.</p>
<p>The catalogs are largely disjoint: only 3 of 24 ζ_8 quaternions appear in the ζ_12 catalog (12%), only 2 of 13 directions overlap (15%). The capacity gain is from genuinely new algebraic structure, not from "more of the same." The finite-group ceiling is real and specific to ζ_8; switching roots of unity removes it.</p>
<p>The conceptual lesson is clean: <strong>a finite quaternion group imposes a hard capacity ceiling</strong>. Once the catalog is fixed, combinatorial diversity is exhausted at some XOR(N). An infinite group has no such ceiling — capacity is limited only by catalog size and computational search resources.</p>
<h3>Only ζ_4 and ζ_8 Generate Finite Groups (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">Demo 80</a>)</h3>
<p>Which roots of unity generate finite SU(2) subgroups under this construction? <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">Demo 80</a> surveys seven cases (N = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20) by running group closure to cap.</p>
<p>The result: <strong>only ζ_4 and ζ_8</strong> close. ζ_4 generates the 4-element binary dihedral group Q_4 (equivalently {±1, ±i} as unit quaternions). ζ_8 generates the 24-element binary octahedral group, ADE type E_7. Every other tested root generates a group that grows past 4096 elements without closing, approaching a dense subgroup of SU(2).</p>
<p>The pattern is not monotone in N. ζ_6 (sitting between the two finite cases) is infinite, despite cos(π/3) = 1/2 being rational. The <strong>power-of-two conjecture</strong> characterizes the finite cases: rotations by π/2^k (k ≥ 1) generate finite groups under perpendicular-axis composition. π/2 and π/4 are symmetries of the cube; π/3 is a symmetry of the hexagonal lattice but two perpendicular hexagonal axes generate an infinite group.</p>
<p>The algebraic diagnosis is decisive: at ζ_8, the quantum dimension [2]_q = q + q^{-1} where q = i gives [2]_q = i + (1/i) = i - i = 0 exactly. The quantum dimension <strong>vanishes</strong>. The finite cases ζ_4 and ζ_8 are the lattice points (singular points) of quantum group parameter space — exactly the regime where Kuperberg's #P-hardness result for the Jones polynomial does <em>not</em> apply. Non-lattice roots (all infinite groups) live where the hardness kicks in.</p>
<p>The ADE connection: ζ_8 reaches E_7 (binary octahedral). ζ_4 reaches the D-series (binary dihedral). E_6 (binary tetrahedral, 24 elements) and E_8 (binary icosahedral, 120 elements) are not reachable by the two-perpendicular-axes construction — they require a different generator structure. The Fibonacci anyon parameter ζ_10 generates an infinite group (71 distinct half-angles at 4096 entries), consistent with its use for universal quantum computation via SU(2)-dense braiding.</p>
<h3>The Logarithmic Scaling Law (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">Demo 81</a>)</h3>
<p>For an infinite-group root like ζ_12, how does XOR capacity scale with catalog size? <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">Demo 81</a> runs the full XOR6→XOR12 search at 9 snapshot rounds as the group closure builds, recording transition points.</p>
<p>The result is a <strong>logarithmic scaling law</strong>: max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog_size) + 4.6. The transition points confirm:</p>
<ul>
<li>XOR6 first appears at ~5 entries</li>
<li>XOR8 at ~51 entries</li>
<li>XOR10 at ~275 entries</li>
<li>XOR12 at ~1140 entries</li>
</ul>
<p>Each doubling of catalog size adds ~0.62 to the maximum computable XOR. Equivalently, each +2 XOR inputs requires approximately 10× more entries (3.2 additional doublings). The scaling is monotone: capacity never decreases as more entries are added.</p>
<p>The two-regime vocabulary structure clarifies what is scaling. In early rounds, directions grow as ~40-45% of catalog size — the group is exploring S² and finding new rotation axes. Direction saturation hits at MAX_DIR = 512 (around round 7). After that, only angle refinement continues. Angular diversity is the limiting factor for high XOR levels: the ζ_12 catalog has 12 distinct half-angles at 256 entries and 43 at 4096 entries.</p>
<p>The gap between successive XOR transitions decreases: 3.35 doublings between XOR8 and XOR6, 2.43 between XOR10 and XOR8, 2.05 between XOR12 and XOR10. This is <strong>possibly sub-logarithmic</strong> (O(log N / log log N) rather than O(log N)) but more data points are needed.</p>
<p>Extrapolating: XOR14 requires ~38,000 entries (~11 closure rounds, feasible). XOR16 requires ~615,000 entries (~14 rounds, feasible in hours). XOR20 requires ~160 million entries (memory-limited). XOR32 requires ~10^14 entries (infeasible). The capacity is real and growing, but the exponential catalog cost per XOR level is entirely consistent with Kuperberg's #P-hardness theorem — the hardness is in generating deep entries, not in using them.</p>
<h3>Depth, Not Catalog Size, Is the Real Variable (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">Demo 82</a>)</h3>
<p>The logarithmic law from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">Demo 81</a> raises the question: what determines capacity for a fixed catalog <em>size</em>? Not all catalogs of the same size are equivalent. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">Demo 82</a> compares three 564-entry subsets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shallow</strong>: the first 564 entries by closure order (depths 0-5)</li>
<li><strong>Strided</strong>: every 7th entry from the full 4096-entry catalog (maximum vocabulary coverage)</li>
<li><strong>Deep</strong>: the last 564 entries (all from depth 8, the deepest round)</li>
</ul>
<p>Results at 564 entries: shallow reaches XOR10, strided reaches XOR10, deep reaches <strong>XOR12</strong>. The deep subset achieves 2 additional XOR levels over equally-sized shallow or strided subsets.</p>
<p>The surprising result is the comparison with strided: the 564 strided entries have maximum possible vocabulary — 512 directions, 43 angles, matching the full 4096-entry catalog. The 564 deep entries have strictly less vocabulary: 476 directions, 19 angles. Yet deep reaches XOR12 and strided only XOR10. <strong>Algebraic coherence beats vocabulary</strong>.</p>
<p>The explanation is the <strong>Linear Depth Law</strong>: max_xor ≈ depth + 6. Each closure round (each unit of crossing depth) adds a fixed increment to computational capacity. A depth-d quaternion encodes d generator multiplications — d crossings in the braid/knot sense. Deep entries share algebraic structure: they are all products of approximately 8 generators, giving them common intermediate factors. Shallow entries from different rounds lack this coherence even when they have equivalent vocabulary.</p>
<p>The logarithmic scaling law from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">Demo 81</a> is a corollary of the linear depth law: because catalog size grows as ~2^depth, taking log₂ of an exponential gives a linear function, so max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog) follows from max_xor ≈ depth + const.</p>
<p>Winner anatomy confirms the story: every XOR winner has a <strong>shallow core + deep extensions</strong> structure. Depth-0 entries (the original generators plus identity) appear in every winner at every XOR level. Mean entry depth rises monotonically: 0.52 (XOR6), 0.63 (XOR8), 1.00 (XOR10), 1.98 (XOR12). A sample XOR12 winner has depths [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 5] — three generators, one shallow element, and two progressively deeper "harmonic" entries.</p>
<p>The depth law provides an interpretation of Kuperberg's #P-hardness: the hardness is precisely in generating deep entries (exponential BFS cost in the crossing number), while the algebraic gain from depth is only linear. The cost to compute is exponential in the depth; the computational power gained is linear. This matches the #P structure exactly.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>14. The Decomposition Arc: What DKC Power Is Made Of</h2>
<p>The scaling arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_76.html">Demos 76</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">82</a>) established <em>how much</em> computation is possible — a logarithmic law governed by crossing depth. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demos 83</a> and 84 ask the orthogonal question: <em>what</em> are the distinct components of that computational power? The answer is a resource decomposition: three independent, additive axes that together determine capacity.</p>
<h3>Jones Normalization Destroys Exactly 2 XOR Levels (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>)</h3>
<p>The Jones polynomial is defined as the Kauffman bracket multiplied by a writhe-dependent phase: Jones(L) = (-A³)^{-w} × bracket(L), where w is the writhe (algebraic crossing number). This normalization removes the "framing anomaly" — the bracket's sensitivity to Reidemeister move I — yielding a genuine link invariant rather than a framed-link invariant.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a> asked whether that normalization has a computational cost.</p>
<p>The answer is unambiguous: <strong>yes, exactly 2 XOR levels, at every root tested</strong>.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Root</th><th>Bracket capacity</th><th>Jones capacity</th><th>Loss</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ζ₁₂</td><td>XOR12</td><td>XOR10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>ζ₈</td><td>XOR8</td><td>XOR6</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>This resolves a pattern that had been puzzling since <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">Demo 79</a>. The "N-2" observation — that ζ₁₂ seemed to top out at XOR10 in early work — was an artifact of inadvertently computing Jones-normalized quantities. The bracket genuinely reaches XOR12 at ζ₁₂. The Jones polynomial's "maximally degenerate" normalization (at the TQFT point δ=0 where framing anomaly is strongest) removes exactly the angular information that enables the top two XOR levels.</p>
<p>The mechanism is specific: Jones normalization reduces distinct quaternion count by 33.8% (4096 → 2710) and angle count by 28% (43 → 31), but leaves direction count <strong>unchanged</strong> (512 → 512). Framing lives in <em>how</em> quaternions rotate, not <em>where</em> they point. Angular vocabulary is the limiting resource, and the writhe phase destroys it at the angular dimension.</p>
<p>Writhe and crossing depth are <strong>independent computational axes</strong> (r = 0.14 across 4096 entries at ζ₁₂). Mean absolute writhe grows linearly with depth (0.80 → 3.19 over depths 0–8), confirming that deeper braid words tend to accumulate more writhe — but the low correlation means a deep entry can have low writhe (crossings cancel) or high writhe (crossings accumulate). Chirality structure is not determined by length.</p>
<p>Writhe alone, used as a standalone feature, can compute XOR6: 32 winners found in a brute-force writhe-sum test. But writhe alone cannot reach XOR8 — full power requires writhe interacting with the quaternion lattice. XOR12 winners use both positive and negative writhe entries (chirality variation), with mixed-writhe fractions declining as capacity rises (41% at XOR6, 12% at XOR12).</p>
<p>The <strong>resource decomposition</strong> now reads:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Lattice structure</strong> — base capacity (XOR6 achievable from the lattice alone) 2. <strong>Depth</strong> — +2 XOR levels per closure round (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">Demo 82</a>: linear depth law) 3. <strong>Writhe/framing</strong> — +2 XOR levels additional (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>)</p>
<p>Three independent axes, each additive, each worth exactly the same increment. The phrase "what TQFT calls an anomaly" is exactly the component that DKC computes with. Kirby (1978) established that framing determines 3-manifold topology; Witten (1989) designated δ=0 as TQFT's maximally degenerate point where framing is first discarded; Rasmussen (2004) confirmed that categorified knot theory (Khovanov homology) does <em>not</em> normalize away writhe — the categorified version preserves precisely what the Jones polynomial discards, and what DKC uses for computation.</p>
<h3>Null States and the Logarithmic Structure (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>)</h3>
<p>The ζ₈ catalog contains 24 entries. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a> revealed that <strong>9 of them (37.5%) are bracket-null</strong>: their quaternion real part Re(q) = 0, causing the Kauffman bracket trace to vanish. These are not degenerate entries — they are unit quaternions with full directional information, but they are invisible to the scalar bracket invariant. The question was whether they contribute to computation or are dead weight.</p>
<p>The answer is decisive: <strong>bracket-null entries are indispensable</strong>.</p>
<p>The null census shows a monotone depth gradient: 0% of depth-0 entries are null, 20% of depth-1, 75% of depth-2, 100% of depth-3. The deepest stratum of the ζ₈ catalog is entirely composed of bracket-null entries. The |Re(q)| spectrum is discrete — exactly 4 values {0, 0.5, 0.707, 1.0} — with a hard gap of 0.5 between null and nearest non-null. Nullity is a binary property, not a continuum.</p>
<p>The geometric picture is clean. The 13 S² directions across the 24-entry catalog partition into three types: <ul> <li><strong>6 null-only directions</strong>: cube-edge midpoints (components ±1/√2), covered only by null entries</li> <li><strong>4 non-null-only directions</strong>: tetrahedral axes (components ±1/√3)</li> <li><strong>3 shared directions</strong>: coordinate axes</li> </ul>
<p>Null entries are maximally directionally efficient: each one points to a unique region of S² (1.00 direction per entry). Non-null entries share directions (0.47 per entry). Removing the 9 null entries removes 6 exclusive directions.</p>
<p><strong>The crux experiment</strong>: splitting the catalog by null status and testing XOR capacity reveals the full picture. The non-null subset (15 entries, 7 directions) retains max_xor=8 but drops from 32 to 4 XOR8 winners — an 87.5% reduction. The null-only subset (9 entries, 9 directions) reaches <strong>zero</strong> XOR capacity at all k_sec values tested, including k=1. Random 15-entry subsets achieve mean max_xor = 7.8; the non-null-only subset at max_xor=6 falls below the random baseline. Removing the specific null entries is strictly worse than removing random entries of equal count.</p>
<p>The k_sec sweep resolves the mechanism. The null-only subset is flat at zero winners across all k_sec (k=1,2,4,6,8) — confirming that all bracket-null entries share the same S¹ coordinate (half-angle = 90°, a single point on S¹) and contribute nothing to S¹ angular discrimination. Their computational contribution is purely S² directional. Conversely, the non-null subset can reach XOR8, but requires k_sec = 16–20 to do so — three times the angular resolution that the full catalog needs (k=6). Null entries are <strong>efficiency amplifiers</strong>: they expand directional vocabulary, reducing the angular resolution cost of XOR discrimination.</p>
<p>The winner anatomy confirms the level-dependence. At XOR6, winners actively avoid null entries (mean null count 0.344 per winner, ratio 0.31 relative to the random expectation of 9/24 ≈ 0.375). At XOR8, winners approach the random expectation (ratio 0.79). Null entries are not needed for the lower level; they become essential for the higher one.</p>
<p>The cross-root comparison establishes a systematic pattern: as the group order grows (ζ₄ → ζ₈ → ζ₁₂), the null fraction decreases sharply (75% → 37.5% → 3%). In the infinite-group limit, the null fraction approaches zero. The ζ₈ regime — the computationally sweet spot established in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">Demo 69</a> — is precisely the regime where nulls represent a significant structural fraction. The ζ₄ case (semisimple, δ=2) has 75% null entries but <strong>zero XOR capacity</strong>. Non-semisimplicity IS the computational resource.</p>
<p><strong>The LCFT interpretation</strong>: In logarithmic conformal field theory, null states |N⟩ satisfy ⟨N|N⟩ = 0 but |N⟩ ≠ 0. They are paired with logarithmic partners |L⟩ via a Jordan-cell action of the Virasoro zero-mode L₀ (non-diagonalizable: L₀|L⟩ = h|L⟩ + |N⟩). The two-point function of |N⟩ vanishes, but the mixed function ⟨N|L⟩ is nonzero — the computational content lives in the Jordan-cell coupling. In the DKC context: bracket-null entries (Re(q) = 0, trace = 0) are the algebraic analog of LCFT null states. The 6 null-only directions (cube-edge midpoints) are entries with no non-null partner in the same direction — no logarithmic partner in the catalog. Removing them does not merely reduce capacity; it collapses it, consistent with the LCFT prediction that removing a null state removes its logarithmic partner's anchor.</p>
<p>The 3 shared directions (coordinate axes, appearing in both null and non-null entries) are candidate Jordan-cell pairs: a null entry on axis X and a non-null entry on axis X may form a literal Jordan-cell pair in some braid group algebra representation. The k_sec=1 synergy result — full catalog achieves 36 XOR6 winners at k_sec=1, non-null achieves 0, null-only achieves 0 — is the precise DKC manifestation of the LCFT relation ⟨T|t⟩ = b: the null state and its partner together produce output that neither generates alone.</p>
<p>The decomposition arc thus adds a fourth component to the resource picture: <strong>non-semisimplicity</strong>, which provides both the null-entry directional infrastructure and the Jordan-block memory mechanism that enables depth scaling. Semisimple algebras (ζ₄) are Markov-like — memoryless — and cannot build deep catalogs or achieve XOR capacity. Non-semisimple algebras carry a radical, and it is the radical that does the computational work.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>15. The Indecomposability Arc: Computing b from First Principles</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a> established the LCFT interpretation of bracket-null entries as analogs of logarithmic conformal field theory null states, and ended with a specific prediction: the indecomposability parameter b — the Jordan-cell coupling constant that controls how null and logarithmic partner states interact — should be computable from the TL diagram algebra itself. The literature reported b = -5/8 (Pearce-Rasmussen) and b = -2 (Gainutdinov-Read-Saleur), and the disagreement had never been cleanly resolved. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">Demos 85</a> and 86 attacked this problem head-on.</p>
<h3>b = -5/8 at TL_4 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">Demo 85</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">Demo 85</a> computed b exactly from first principles using a method not previously attempted: leading-coefficient extraction from the delta-parameterized Markov trace on the full regular representation of TL_4. The approach: construct the bilinear form G_delta[i][j] = delta^{L(i,j)} where L counts total loops (composition loops plus closure loops), then extract the leading coefficient as delta approaches zero.</p>
<p>The result at TL_4 (dimension 14): b_delta = -5/2 on the regular representation. Normalizing by the 0-TL sector dimension — the 4 basis diagrams with zero through-lines — gives b_PR = -5/2 / 4 = -5/8, exact to 12 decimal places. The literature "controversy" between b = -2 (GRS) and b = -5/8 (PR) dissolves: they are the same structure under different normalization conventions. The GRS quantum-group approach normalizes differently from the Pearce-Rasmussen finite-lattice approach; the factor of 4 = dim(V_0)^2 = C_2 accounts for the entire discrepancy.</p>
<p>The extraction method depends on a <strong>valuation condition</strong>: the minimum delta-power p_tt in the ⟨t|G|t⟩ form must equal exactly twice the minimum power p_Tt in the ⟨T|G|t⟩ form. At TL_4: p_tt = 2, p_Tt = 1, so 2 = 2 x 1 — satisfied. At TL_6: p_tt = 4, p_Tt = 3, so 4 ≠ 6 — the condition fails, and b diverges as delta^{-2}. The 25-fold multiplicity at TL_6 (dim(V_0)^2 = 25) does not rescue the divergence the way the 4-fold multiplicity does at TL_4. The cross-copy interference grows faster than the multiplicity can absorb.</p>
<p>A key falsification along the way: Gemini 3 Pro had claimed that b is extracted from Jordan-cell coupling in standard modules. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">Demo 85</a> proved this wrong by direct computation — the Hamiltonian on the standard module W_{n,0} is fully diagonalizable at every size tested (n = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12). The minimal polynomial is square-free; there are no Jordan blocks. The non-semisimple structure needed for b lives exclusively in projective covers (P_{0,0}) and the full regular representation. Standard modules are too simple.</p>
<p>The fixed-point trace form — the natural first attempt — turned out to be degenerate at delta=0: almost all TL products create loops that die, leaving a form with 3-dimensional gauge freedom at TL_4 where M (the quadratic coefficient matrix) = 0. Both b = -2 and b = -5/8 are reachable points on this flat affine manifold. The delta-parameterized form breaks the degeneracy.</p>
<h3>The Negative Result: P_{0,0} Diverges (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">Demo 86</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">Demo 85</a> succeeded on the full regular representation at TL_4 but diverged at TL_6. The natural next attempt: bypass the regular representation entirely and compute b directly on a single projective cover P_{0,0}. If the valuation condition fails because of cross-copy interference on the regular representation, perhaps it holds on a single copy.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">Demo 86</a> tested this exhaustively. The delta-parameterized Gram matrix approach <strong>universally diverges</strong> on a single P_{0,0} — at every eigenvalue, every lattice size (TL_4, TL_6), and for both loop and trace forms. The valuation condition p_tt = 2*p_Tt never holds on a single copy. This is a novel negative finding; nobody in the literature had tried this specific approach.</p>
<p>The multiplicity from the regular representation is structurally essential to the b computation, not just a removable scale factor. At TL_4, the regular representation contains dim(V_0)^2 = 4 copies of P_{0,0}, and those 4 copies collectively provide the extra delta-power needed for the valuation condition to hold. A single copy cannot substitute.</p>
<p>An additional discovery: TL_8's P_{0,0} is completely semisimple at lambda=0 — no Jordan blocks at all. The non-semisimple structure that enables b computation does not persist at this lattice size on a single projective cover. The projective cover dimensions follow a Catalan pattern: dim(P_{0,0}) = C_{n/2+1} (TL_4 → 5 = C_3, TL_6 → 14 = C_4, TL_8 → 42 = C_5).</p>
<p>The indecomposability arc thus delivers a clean positive result (b = -5/8 confirmed at TL_4, resolving the normalization controversy) paired with a clean negative result (the method does not extend to larger lattices via either the regular representation or direct P_{0,0} computation). The actual Pearce-Rasmussen method for larger lattices likely uses transfer-matrix finite-size scaling, not the diagram-algebraic approach tested here.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>16. The Regime Transition: Null Indispensability Has Boundaries</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>'s null indispensability theorem was established at ζ₈ — a finite group with 24 elements. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">Demos 87</a> and 88 asked: does this generalize?</p>
<h3>Null Dispensability at Infinite Groups (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">Demo 87</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">Demo 87</a> replicated the null analysis at ζ₁₂, where the group is infinite (4096 entries at 8 closure rounds). The null fraction drops from 37.5% (ζ₈) to 3.0% (ζ₁₂), continuing the dilution pattern (ζ₄: 75%, ζ₈: 37.5%, ζ₁₂: 3.0%). The 121 null entries occupy 67 exclusive S² directions — directions that no non-null entry reaches.</p>
<p>The capacity test is unambiguous: removing all 121 bracket-null entries preserves full XOR capacity. XOR6, XOR8, XOR10, and XOR12 all retain their maximum winner counts (32 each). Null entries are <strong>directionally indispensable</strong> (they own 67 exclusive axes) but <strong>computationally dispensable</strong> (their removal changes nothing about what functions can be computed). This is the opposite of ζ₈, where removing nulls destroyed XOR8 capacity.</p>
<p>The <strong>Regime Transition Theorem</strong> crystallizes: there is a qualitative boundary between finite groups (ζ₈: nulls critical, sparse direction set, 6/13 exclusive directions in a 13-direction space) and infinite groups (ζ₁₂: nulls redundant, dense direction set, 67/2043 exclusive directions in a 2043-direction space). The controlling variable is direction density — when the non-null direction count (1976 at ζ₁₂) is large enough, losing 67 null-only directions cannot constrain the combinatorial search for XOR solutions. Directional indispensability (owning exclusive territory) is necessary but not sufficient for computational indispensability.</p>
<h3>The Two-Role Architecture and Anti-Correlation Mechanism (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">Demo 88</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">Demo 72</a> had established the Anti-Correlation Theorem: the 13 algebraic eigenvector directions are simultaneously the worst possible spherical t-design (t=0, failing at l=1) and the best for DKC computation (36 XOR6 solutions vs 4 for geometrically optimized directions). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">Demo 88</a> asked the mechanistic question: <em>which</em> directions carry the computational load, and <em>which</em> carry the anti-correlation?</p>
<p>The 13 ζ₈ directions form a cuboctahedron on S², decomposing into three orbits under octahedral symmetry: 3 coordinate axes (shared null/non-null), 4 body diagonals (non-null-only, mutual angle 70.5°), and 6 edge midpoints (null-only, mutual angle 60°/90°). Selective perturbation reveals the architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perturbing <strong>null-only</strong> (edge midpoint) directions by 10° causes -2.4% XOR loss — actually a <em>gain</em>. These directions are flexible scaffolding.</li>
<li>Perturbing <strong>non-null-only</strong> (body diagonal) directions by 10° causes 8.0% XOR loss. These are the rigid computational anchors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial prediction — that null directions would be more sensitive because they carry the radical's computational content — was <strong>inverted</strong>. The 4 body-diagonal non-null directions are the fragile, load-bearing anchors of the computation. The 6 null edge-midpoint directions are redundant scaffolding that provides S² coverage but can be moved without computational cost.</p>
<p>This inversion enables a practical optimization: constraining non-null directions to within 2° of their algebraic positions while letting null directions move freely captures 92% of the unconstrained spherical design improvement (48% vs 52% residual reduction) while cutting computational loss by more than half (2.8% vs 6.4%). The null directions carry nearly all the geometric improvement capacity; the non-null directions carry nearly all the computational necessity.</p>
<p>The <strong>k-ladder resilience theorem</strong> resolves the apparent contradiction with <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">Demo 72</a>. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">Demo 72</a> used Voronoi-only activation and saw 89% destruction under design-improving optimization. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">Demo 88</a> uses the Sec×Vor k-ladder activation (K_LADDER = {1,6,8,10,12,16,20,24}) and sees only 6.4% loss under the same gradient — a 14× improvement in robustness. The mechanism: Voronoi-only gives each weight triple one chance at a specific angular resolution (knife-edge sensitivity), while the k-ladder gives each triple eight chances at different resolutions (small direction shifts absorbed by switching k_sec). The same activation function introduced for capacity (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">Demo 77</a>) also provides computational robustness — a dual benefit.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>17. The Depth Law Mechanism: Three-Demo Arc</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">Demo 82</a> established the linear depth law — max_xor ≈ depth + 6 — and showed that algebraic coherence beats vocabulary: 564 deep entries outperform 564 strided entries with maximal vocabulary by 2 XOR levels. But <em>why</em> deep entries compose better was left as an open question. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_89.html">Demos 89</a>, 90, and 91 constitute a three-demo arc that answers it.</p>
<h3>Killing Five Hypotheses (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_89.html">Demo 89</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_89.html">Demo 89</a> systematically tested eight mechanistic hypotheses across eleven computational phases. Five were definitively eliminated:</p>
<p><strong>Pairwise coherence</strong>: Mean pairwise |qdot| (quaternion alignment) is flat at ~0.42 across all depth shells, identical to the random baseline. Intra-depth coherence (0.4214) is actually <em>less</em> than inter-depth coherence (0.4254) — depth shells are more internally orthogonal than across shells. The opposite of what a coherence-based mechanism would predict.</p>
<p><strong>Direction coverage</strong>: All 13 ζ₈ directions are covered by depth 2. The +6 intercept in the depth law relates to XOR6 base capacity, not direction coverage timing.</p>
<p><strong>Cayley density</strong>: Same-depth entries have <em>zero</em> mutual Cayley edges (mathematically necessary from BFS construction). The deep-564 subset has 0 internal Cayley edges; strided-564 has 58. Yet deep beats strided. Graph density and computational capacity are anti-correlated.</p>
<p><strong>Sector saturation</strong>: Pairwise sum sectors saturate early and do not grow with depth. Voronoi coverage is always 100%. Sectors are not the bottleneck.</p>
<p><strong>Angle coherence (for deep entries)</strong>: Deep shells (d &gt;= 3) have random-like angle variance. Only shallow shells (d=0, d=1) show angle coherence. The mechanism is not about deep entries having similar angles.</p>
<p>Two findings survived: cell diversity grows exponentially with depth (log₂(distinct_cells) ≈ 1.17d + 2, tracking max_xor quantitatively), and paired extension is real but a minority pathway at ζ₁₂ (6-20% of winners vs 100% at ζ₈). The dominant pathway (80-94%) at ζ₁₂ uses all-distinct-direction tuples. Shadow pairing dominates when direction vocabulary is small; direction diversity dominates when it is large.</p>
<h3>The Mechanism: Axis Cancellation and Spectral Inversion (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">Demo 90</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">Demo 90</a> found the answer in two complementary discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>Axis cancellation</strong>: XOR winners preferentially contain anti-aligned quaternion pairs. Mean minimum axis dot product for XOR8 winners = -0.75 vs -0.65 for random non-winners. Two quaternions with nearly opposite rotation axes partially cancel when summed, yielding a quaternion with a small rotation angle (30-66°) — exactly what sector activation needs for fine-grained parity discrimination. This is the geometric content of "algebraic coherence."</p>
<p><strong>Cross-depth algebraic constraint</strong>: BFS-derived entries at depth d have constrained pairwise sums with generators. Generator-times-deep (d=7-8) produces only 73 distinct sum angles from 50,000 pairs. Compare: shallow-times-shallow = 15 distinct, deep-times-deep = 1,313 distinct. The BFS ancestry creates algebraic relationships that restrict the sum-angle vocabulary between related entries. This is the concrete mechanism behind "algebraic coherence" — deep entries share algebraic structure (common intermediate factors from their generator-multiplication history) that constrains how they combine.</p>
<p>The clinching evidence is <strong>spectral inversion</strong>: spherical harmonic decomposition of the S² point cloud (rotation axis positions on the sphere) shows that bandwidth <em>decreases</em> as depth increases. BW_90% drops from l=4 (depth 0) to l=2 (cumulative all depths). BW_99% drops from l=11 to l=6. The point cloud converges to uniform — individual entry positions become <em>less</em> informative with depth, yet computation improves linearly. This rules out all positional/bandwidth-based explanations. The computation is <strong>relational, not positional</strong>: what matters is how entries combine (axis cancellation, cross-depth constraints), not where they individually sit on S².</p>
<h3>The Wall Is Parity, Not Activation (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">Demo 91</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">Demo 91</a> closed the arc by testing the final hypothesis: could the linear depth law be an artifact of the activation function's limited resolution? If finer angular resolution shifted the depth gap between XOR levels, the bottleneck would be activation geometry.</p>
<p>The answer: <strong>no</strong>. max_xor = 8 at <em>all</em> k_sec values from 2 to 48, with 275 entries at ζ₁₂. Even 4 total activation cells (k=2 sectors, 2 directions) can compute XOR8. The depth gap — the increment required to go from XOR6 to XOR8 — is invariant across all tested activation resolutions (k_sec = 2 to 48, direction counts 2 to 114). Finer resolution reveals more <em>solutions</em> to the same parity constraint (XOR8 winners grow 13× from k=2 to k=48) but does not enable higher parity. The activation is a counting mechanism, not an existence mechanism.</p>
<p>The three-demo arc converges on the <strong>balanced exponentials</strong> explanation: BFS closure rounds add vocabulary at rate ~2× per round, while parity demand grows at 4× per weight level (2^{2N} masks). The ratio yields ~2 depth rounds per additional weight, producing the observed slope of approximately 1 in max_xor ≈ depth + 6. This was confirmed from both the supply side (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">Demo 90</a>: vocabulary growth rate) and the demand side (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">Demo 91</a>: activation invariance). The depth law is a property of the parity constraint meeting exponential BFS growth, and the mechanism by which deep entries exploit this is relational — axis cancellation creating favorable sum-angle structure through algebraically constrained combinations.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>18. The Parity-Lock Theorem: What the Encoding Computes</h2>
<p>The depth law explains <em>how</em> computation scales. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">Demo 92</a> asked a different question: <em>what</em> does the ±q paired input encoding compute? Under this encoding, each input bit pair (x_{2i}, x_{2i+1}) maps to +q_i, -q_i, or 0 depending on whether the bits agree or disagree. The depth law max_xor ≈ depth + 6 had been measured exclusively for parity (XOR). Is it a general scaling law, or is parity the <em>only</em> function this encoding can compute?</p>
<p>The answer is the latter. The <strong>Parity-Lock Theorem</strong> (P04, formally proven in <code>proofs/parity-lock-theorem.md</code>) establishes that the ±q encoding is structurally locked to parity functions.</p>
<p>The mechanism is the <strong>(0,0) ≡ (1,1) collision</strong>: for each weight q_i, both input pair (0,0) and input pair (1,1) produce the same contribution to the quaternion sum (both map to the zero vector, since 0·q + 0·(-q) = 0 and 1·q + 1·(-q) = 0). This means masks 0...0 and 1...1 always produce identical sums. Any Boolean function f where f(0...0) ≠ f(1...1) is therefore impossible under <em>any</em> activation — the activation cannot distinguish two inputs that produce the same quaternion sum. AND, OR, MAJ, and threshold functions all require f(0...0) ≠ f(1...1), so all have exactly zero winners at every depth tested (0-8) for both 6-input and 8-input arities.</p>
<p>XOR survives because XOR(0...0) = XOR(1...1) = 0 for even-length inputs — the collision is harmless. More precisely, the encoding creates 3^k equivalence classes (k weights, each with three effective states {-q, 0, +q}), and XOR/XNOR are the only standard Boolean functions constant on all classes.</p>
<p>Computational verification confirms the theorem at every level: 83.7% of random 3-weight triples are XOR6-separable; AND, OR, and MAJ separability is 0.0%. Among 2,016 mask pairs at 6 inputs, all 76 quaternion-sum collisions are same-parity (zero cross-parity collisions). A sign-flip symmetry (combined_cell(S) = combined_cell(-S)) further collapses the 3^k classes to at most (3^k+1)/2 distinguishable groups.</p>
<p>The theorem reframes the depth law: max_xor ≈ depth + 6 is not a general Boolean function scaling law. It is the scaling law for parity — the <em>only</em> achievable function family under the ±q encoding. The encoding naturally concentrates all computational power on the single Boolean function outside AC⁰ (constant-depth polynomial-size circuits). This connects DKC to circuit complexity in a precise way: the ±q encoding channels everything into the computationally hardest function, and the depth law describes the cost of computing it.</p>
<p>The Parity-Lock Theorem is the fourth formally proven result in the DKC program (P04), joining the radical dimension formula, the next-level radical formula, and the Markov RT truncation theorem.</p>

564 strided entries (512 dirs, 43 angles, matching the full 4096-entry vocabulary) reach only XOR10; more vocabulary loses to less vocabulary with more depth (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">Demo 82</a>).</li> <li><strong>Shallow core + deep extensions architecture</strong>: every XOR winner contains depth-0 generators plus progressively deeper elements; mean winner depth rises monotonically 0.52 → 0.63 → 1.00 → 1.98 across XOR6 → XOR8 → XOR10 → XOR12 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">Demo 82</a>).</li> <li><strong>Framing = +2 XOR levels</strong>: Jones normalization (writhe phase removal) costs exactly 2 XOR levels at both ζ₈ and ζ₁₂; bracket XOR8 → Jones XOR6, bracket XOR12 → Jones XOR10; the loss is constant and root-independent (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>).</li> <li><strong>N-2 pattern resolved</strong>: the "N-2" capacity observation from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">Demo 79</a> was Jones capacity, not a bracket truncation artifact; the bracket genuinely reaches XOR12 at ζ₁₂ (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>).</li> <li><strong>Framing lives in angles, not directions</strong>: Jones normalization reduces angle count by 28% (43 → 31) but leaves direction count unchanged (512 → 512) at ζ₁₂; angular vocabulary is the mechanism of capacity loss (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>).</li> <li><strong>Writhe and depth are independent axes</strong>: depth-writhe correlation r = 0.14 across 4096 ζ₁₂ entries; mean |writhe| grows linearly with depth (0.80 → 3.19 over depths 0–8) but the low correlation confirms these are genuinely separate resources (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>).</li> <li><strong>Resource decomposition</strong>: DKC computational power decomposes additively as lattice base (XOR6) + depth contribution (+2 per closure round) + writhe/framing contribution (+2); three independent axes, each worth the same increment (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>).</li> <li><strong>TQFT anomaly is computational content</strong>: the writhe phase factor that TQFT treats as a framing anomaly and normalizes away contributes exactly 2 XOR levels; what TQFT discards, DKC computes with (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>).</li> <li><strong>Bracket-null census</strong>: 9 of 24 ζ₈ catalog entries are bracket-null (Re(q) = 0, 37.5%); null fraction increases monotonically with depth: 0% at d=0, 20% at d=1, 75% at d=2, 100% at d=3; every maximally-deep entry is bracket-null (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>).</li> <li><strong>Gap theorem</strong>: the |Re(q)| spectrum of the ζ₈ catalog is discrete with exactly 4 values {0, 0.5, 0.707, 1.0} and a hard gap of 0.5; nullity is binary, not a continuum (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>).</li> <li><strong>Null indispensability</strong>: removing the 9 bracket-null entries from the ζ₈ catalog drops XOR8 winners from 32 to 4 (87.5% reduction); the non-null-only subset performs below random 15-entry controls (mean 7.8 vs 6.0); nulls are disproportionately important (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>).</li> <li><strong>Null directional efficiency</strong>: each bracket-null entry covers exactly 1.00 unique S² direction (cube-edge midpoints, 6 null-only directions); non-null entries cover only 0.47 directions per entry and share axes; nulls are maximally efficient as directional vocabulary (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>).</li> <li><strong>S¹ flatness of null-only</strong>: all bracket-null entries share half-angle = 90°, placing them at a single point on S¹; their entire computational contribution is from S² directional diversity; confirmed by flat k_sec sweep at zero winners across k=1,2,4,6,8 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>).</li> <li><strong>Null efficiency amplification</strong>: the non-null-only subset can reach XOR8, but requires k_sec = 16–20 (vs k=6 for the full catalog); null entries reduce the angular resolution cost of XOR discrimination by a factor of ~3 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>).</li> <li><strong>Level-dependent null usage</strong>: XOR6 winners avoid null entries (ratio 0.31 vs random expectation); XOR8 winners approach the random rate (ratio 0.79); null entries are not needed at low capacity but become essential at high capacity (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>).</li> <li><strong>Non-semisimplicity IS the computational resource</strong>: ζ₄ (semisimple, δ=2) has 75% null entries but zero XOR capacity; ζ₈ (non-semisimple, δ=0) achieves full capacity; non-semisimplicity provides both the null-entry directional infrastructure and the Jordan-block memory mechanism (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>).</li> <li><strong>Null fraction dilution</strong>: null fraction decreases as group order grows — ζ₄: 75%, ζ₈: 37.5%, ζ₁₂: 3.0%; in the infinite-group limit the null fraction approaches zero (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>).</li> <li><strong>Barrington-Radical Principle</strong>: the radical of W_{6,4} carries an abelian writhe character (M<em>r = A^{writhe}</em>r for all 32,768 entries);

<h2>20. Complement-Blindness and the Circuit Complexity Hierarchy</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">Demo 93</a> began from a simple question: what can the 1-weight-per-input encoding compute under the combined_cell activation that the depth law arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">Demos 82</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">91</a>) had been using? The answer was unexpected and clean: <strong>nothing useful</strong>.</p>
<h3>Complement-Blindness (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">Demo 93</a>, Phases 1-4)</h3>
<p>Under combined_cell, the <code>if (qa &lt; 0)</code> normalization maps both a mask m and its bitwise complement ~m to the same cell: mask m produces sum S, complement ~m produces -S, and the absolute-value normalization maps both to the same half-plane. Any function where f(m) != f(~m) is therefore impossible. For odd N (3, 5, 7), complement-invariance kills every standard Boolean function — the complement of any odd-length mask has different popcount parity, so even XOR fails. At even N (4, 6, 8), XOR survives (it is complement-invariant) but AND, OR, and MAJ are all dead. 100% complement-pair cell sharing was verified exhaustively at N=3-6 (400-3200 pairs each).</p>
<p>This is a parallel to <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>'s Parity-Lock Theorem but operating on a different axis: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a> showed that the ±q <em>encoding</em> locks computation to parity functions; <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a> shows that the combined_cell <em>activation</em> locks 1wpi computation to complement-invariant functions. Encoding provides the algebra; activation selects what is extractable.</p>
<h3>Phase-Cell Recovery (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">Demo 93</a>, Phase 5)</h3>
<p>Removing the <code>if (qa &lt; 0)</code> sign flip creates phase_cell, where the sector spans [0,360) instead of [0,180). Complement-pair sharing drops from 100% to 1.1%. All 13 NPN classes are recovered at N=3 (12/13 at depth 0, the last at depth 1). The activation — not the encoding or the lattice — was once again the wall.</p>
<h3>The Circuit Complexity Hierarchy Emerges (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">Demo 93</a>, Phases 6-8)</h3>
<p>Under phase_cell, all functions become achievable, but a hierarchy manifests in <em>hit rates</em>. AND is easy (it is in AC⁰ — constant-depth polynomial-size circuits). MAJ is intermediate (it is TC⁰-complete). XOR is hard (it is the canonical function outside AC⁰, requiring exponential depth in bounded-width circuits). The AND/XOR hit-rate ratio at depth 1 explodes super-exponentially with arity: 1.01 (N=3), 1.08 (N=4), 1.44 (N=5), 7.27 (N=6), 2762 (N=7), infinity (N=8). The hierarchy is Hastad's theorem made visible in a topological computation model.</p>
<p>The mechanism is pigeonhole. At depth 1 with 17 entries and k_sec=12, there are 84 cells. XOR requires a balanced bisection of 2^N masks into cells — when 2^N exceeds the cell count (N=7: 128 &gt; 84; N=8: 256 &gt; 84), balanced bisection becomes impossible. AND survives because it only needs one unique cell for the all-1s mask. MAJ shows a cliff at N=8 (2.4%, down from 68.7% at N=7) — a threshold phenomenon related to TC⁰-completeness meeting the pigeonhole boundary.</p>
<p>Depth disproportionately helps parity. At N=6, MAJ is easier than XOR at low depth (49.6% vs 9.9% at d=1) but XOR overtakes at d~4 (76.9% vs 73.6%). The AND/XOR ratio converges from 7.27 (d=1) to 1.08 (d=6). XOR's growth curve is logarithmic approach to saturation. This is the first measurement of how the Hastad/Furst-Saxe-Sipser circuit complexity hierarchy manifests in a physical computational model.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>21. The Solvability Bottleneck: Binary Icosahedral Group</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">Demo 94</a> asked: if the finite/infinite group boundary (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a>) governs capacity ceilings, where does <em>solvability</em> — the group-theoretic property that Barrington's theorem (1989) identifies as the computational power boundary — fit into the DKC picture?</p>
<h3>The Unique Non-Solvable Finite SU(2) Subgroup</h3>
<p>The ADE classification of finite SU(2) subgroups has exactly one non-solvable case: the binary icosahedral group 2I (E₈, order 120). All other finite SU(2) subgroups — binary dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral — are solvable. The z8 group (binary octahedral, E₇, order 48) that the entire DKC program has been built on is solvable. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a> implements 2I using exact Z[sqrt(5)] arithmetic (quaternion components stored as (a + b*sqrt(5))/4, zero floating point in group operations), builds the 120-element closure via BFS in 7 rounds, and extracts 60 bracket values (mod ± identification), with 31 distinct S² directions and 9 conjugacy classes.</p>
<h3>Solvability Confirmed as the Bottleneck</h3>
<p>At matched catalog size (24 entries each), random 2I subsets consistently outperform z8 for XOR, with the advantage <em>accelerating</em> with computational difficulty: 1.07x at N=3, 1.14x at N=4, 1.21x at N=5, 1.67x at N=6. The advantage is not merely from more elements — it is specifically from the algebraic structure. At the full 60-entry 2I catalog (31 directions, 384 cells), N=6 XOR hit rate is 37.12% versus <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s 9.85% at z8 (17 entries, depth 1) — a 3.8x advantage. At N=7: 2.38% vs 0.02% (119x).</p>
<h3>Circuit Complexity Hierarchy Is Universal</h3>
<p>The AND/XOR ratio explosion seen in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a> under z8 reappears identically under 2I: AND/XOR grows from 1.25 (N=3) to 68,827 (N=8). XOR dies at N=8 (0.001%). The hierarchy is a property of the readout mechanism (1wpi + phase_cell), not the group. This confirms that the Hastad depth hierarchy in DKC is structural — it does not depend on solvability or group size.</p>
<h3>The Crossover: Non-Solvability at the Computational Boundary</h3>
<p>Phase 4's three-way comparison (z8, 2I, truncated z12) reveals a crossover. At small N, the truncated-infinite z12 catalog (51 entries) outperforms both finite groups due to angular variety from its dense SU(2) coverage. But at N=6-7 — the computational boundary where parity becomes genuinely hard — 2I overtakes z12 despite having more entries (60 vs 51). Non-solvability provides specifically the algebraic structure that parity needs at the boundary.</p>
<h3>Five-Pillar Synthesis Complete</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a> completes the five-pillar synthesis of DKC as a <strong>discrete algebraic reservoir computer</strong>:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Abramsky</strong> (TL algebra as computation) — the topological backbone 2. <strong>Habiro</strong> (cyclotomic integrality) — the algebraic substrate, now extended from Z[zeta_8] to Z[sqrt(5)] 3. <strong>Aizenberg</strong> (MVN activation) — the readout mechanism, generalized to phase_cell 4. <strong>Nazer-Gastpar</strong> (compute-and-forward) — the additive readout structure 5. <strong>Reservoir Computing</strong> (Maass/Jaeger) — the architectural frame: fixed catalog = reservoir, Cayley graph = connectivity, signed sum = linear readout, activation = nonlinear output, BFS depth = memory depth</p>
<p>The mapping to reservoir computing is now precise, not metaphorical. The testable prediction: rank(K_2I)/rank(K_z8) should exceed 120/24 if non-solvability contributes above raw catalog size — a single kernel-rank computation that would confirm or refute the algebraic reservoir interpretation. This is seeded as <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">D95</a>.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>15. The Commutator/Synergy Arc: Why Cross-Layer Interaction Is the Computation</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a> identified solvability as the capacity bottleneck. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">D95</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_97.html">D97</a> dissected the internal structure of the solvable z8 group to reveal <em>how</em> solvability constrains computation and <em>where</em> the computational power actually resides.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">Demo 95</a> computed the derived series of z8 for the first time in the DKC context: 24 &gt; 12 &gt; 4 &gt; 1, corresponding to 2O &gt; 2T &gt; Q8 &gt; {+-1}. The commutator subgroup (12 entries) and non-commutator coset (12 entries) have nearly equal XOR capacity in isolation (within 1.14x). Yet the full 24-entry group dramatically outperforms both: 2.7x the hit rate at N=5. The computational power is not <em>in</em> any layer but <em>between</em> layers. This is the same 0+0&gt;0 synergy as <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>'s null/non-null discovery, now traced to its algebraic origin. A matched comparison at 90-degree entries (where geometry is identical) showed Q8-null and outermost-null entries each producing zero XOR alone, but their mixture achieving 26% at N=4 -- algebra over geometry, pure synergy.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_96.html">Demo 96</a> asked whether <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>'s null/non-null partition and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">D95</a>'s derived series partition are the same split. They are not -- they are <em>independent</em>. Their 2D cross-product creates a 5-cell landscape (A through E) that fully explains the DKC capacity structure. The critical finding: the optimal z8 catalog is A+B+C (21 entries), not ALL (24). The 3 Q8-null entries (Cell D) are pure noise -- removing them <em>improves</em> capacity at every N. Cell B (6 entries, D0-nonnull, 45-degree half-angle, 3 orthogonal directions) achieves 100% XOR at every N tested. The cross-derived synergy principle: non-null entries from <em>different</em> derived levels produce maximum synergy. B+C dominates all pairwise combinations. The null/non-null boundary matters more than the derived level boundary at every arity.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_97.html">Demo 97</a> explained <em>why</em> Cell B is perfect: geometric inevitability from 3 mutually orthogonal directions forming a regular octahedron on S^2. The half-angle is not critical -- any angle in the 25-75 degree plateau produces identical 100% results. The mechanism is the lever arm: nonzero real component of the quaternion provides the lever for phase_cell to distinguish XOR=0 from XOR=1 sums. At 90 degrees (null), the real component vanishes, the lever arm collapses, and total separation failure occurs. This geometrically explains why null entries are dead (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>/<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_96.html">D96</a>) and why non-null entries at any non-extreme angle are load-bearing. Perfection is the octahedron, not a magic number.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>16. The Multi-Strand Arc: From Trace Bottleneck to the Ext^1 Thesis</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">D98</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a> opened an entirely new direction: extending DKC from 2-strand (quaternionic) to higher-strand (matrix-valued) computation. The arc revealed that multi-strand algebras contain far richer structure than 2-strand, but accessing it requires solving a readout problem that the trace readout catastrophically fails at.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">Demo 98</a> built the 3-strand BFS catalog via the 5x5 TL_3 representation. The group is infinite (unlike 2-strand's finite 24-element binary octahedral), reaching 2048 entries at cap with 98.5% interleaving. Entanglement vanishing confirmed at scale: all 31 non-interleaving entries have zero bracket. But the trace readout produces only 105 distinct values from 2048 matrices -- 5.1% retention, 96% information loss. The result: zero XOR6 at every k_sec tested. Column 4, by contrast, preserves 100% of algebraic diversity (2048 distinct 20-integer vectors). The readout, not the algebra, is the bottleneck.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">Demo 99</a> broke through the readout barrier by working on the irreducible 2x2 standard module Delta_1 directly over Z[zeta_8], combined with a 16-component sign-pattern activation. This produced the first-ever 3-strand XOR computation: XOR6=500,261, XOR8=48,143, XOR10=485, XOR12=16, XOR14=60. The braid group image is infinite (Jordan block structure proves sigma_1 has infinite order), with entry magnitudes growing by exact Fibonacci ratios. The extension class Ext^1(L(0), L(1)) is the computational resource -- the non-split extension provides the catalytic preparation for eigenvalue discrimination. A two-regime discovery emerged: combinatorial (XOR6-8, shallow, diversity-driven) and algebraic (XOR10-14, deep, Ext^1-catalytic), with a phase transition at the XOR8-XOR10 boundary. Super-hubs form a star graph topology (2 irreplaceable hubs + rotating satellites), structurally different from 2-strand Cell B's mutual orthogonality.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">Demo 100</a> extended to 4-strand, acting on the 3-dimensional non-semisimple W_{4,2} module. BFS growth stabilized near 3.1x per round, consistent with the sl_3 prediction. Six super-hubs emerged, paired by cyclotomic trace component. All hub commutators are traceless with zero radical content -- they annihilate the radical direction and live entirely in the semisimple quotient. The radical content stays constant across all BFS depths (mean=2), meaning every entry carries the non-semisimple extension structure equally. Casimir grows exponentially with depth (~2x per round) and correlates positively with XOR capacity (1.36x-1.86x winner/control ratio). XOR14=70 at deep entries.</p>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">Demo 101</a> tested the sl_d functor thesis at 5-strand on W_{5,3} -- crucially, a <em>simple</em> module (no radical, n=5 odd). Growth rate confirmed at ~4x per round, the third data point confirming that BFS growth tracks n-1 (2, 3.1, 4 for strands 3, 4, 5). But the hub count prediction was falsified: only 3 hubs appeared, not the predicted 12. And XOR14 vanished entirely (vs 70 in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a>). Most strikingly, the Casimir-XOR correlation inverted at higher XOR levels: winners at XOR6-8 have higher Casimir (matching <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a>), but XOR10-12 winners have <em>lower</em> Casimir (0.54x-0.89x ratio). All three hub commutators are the zero matrix -- the hubs mutually commute, living in a commutative subalgebra. The simple module has broader shallow capacity (more XOR6-8 solutions than <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a>) but strictly less deep capacity (XOR14=0). The conclusion: non-semisimple extension is computationally load-bearing at the XOR14 boundary, not algebraic decoration. The radical provides the degrees of freedom that enable the hardest computations.</p>

<h2>17. The Multi-Strand Scaling Arc: Radical Refutation and Activation Diagnostics</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">Demos 98</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">101</a> established that multi-strand DKC works — that matrix-valued braid representations compute XOR via sign-hash activation, with BFS growth tracking n-1 and non-semisimple modules outperforming simple ones at the hardest XOR levels. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">Demos 102</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">105</a> constituted a systematic four-demo arc that pressure-tested every moving part of the multi-strand framework at n=6 and n=8, yielding a definitive refutation of the radical-as-resource hypothesis, settling the growth-law question, diagnosing the activation bottleneck, and discovering a regime transition in branching interaction structure.</p>
<h3>The Barrington-Radical Principle (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">Demo 102</a>)</h3>
<p>The multi-strand arc's central question had been sharpening since <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">Demo 100</a>: does the radical of a non-semisimple TL module provide computational advantage for parity? <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">Demo 101</a> showed that the simple W_{5,3} achieved XOR14=0 while the non-semisimple W_{4,2} achieved XOR14=70. But strand count, module dimension, and radical structure were all confounded. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">Demo 102</a> isolated the radical as the sole variable: W_{6,0} (dim=5, simple, radical dim=0) versus W_{6,4} (dim=5, non-simple, radical dim=1), both on the same 6-strand braid group with identical dimensionality.</p>
<p>The result was a landmark refutation. The simple module W_{6,0} won at <em>every</em> XOR level: XOR6 (2449 vs 2370), XOR8 (850 vs 793), XOR10 (1 vs 0). The radical carries an abelian writhe character — M<em>r = A^{writhe(M)}</em>r for all 32,768 catalog entries — which by Barrington's theorem (1989) is provably useless for parity computation. Abelian groups cannot compute parity. The radical is "frozen": it remembers only the total writhe of the braid word, acting as a 1-dimensional representation through the Z/8Z group of A-powers.</p>
<p>This named result — the <strong>Barrington-Radical Principle</strong> — connects TL representation theory directly to computational complexity theory. The radical content (L1 norm of M*r) is constant at 3 across all 32,768 entries. The radical direction has constant magnitude regardless of braid word length. The max coefficient magnitude follows strict Fibonacci (1,1,2,3,5,8,13) through depth 6 in the non-simple module but breaks to 16 in the simple module — the radical constrains coefficient growth, another manifestation of its abelian character.</p>
<p>The nuance: B_full (2370) exceeded B_quotient-only (2195) at XOR6, an 8% boost from the mixing row. The mixing row encodes how the quotient block leaks into the radical direction. So the radical is not entirely inert — it provides a small boost relative to the bare quotient — but the 5-dimensional simple module beats the 4+1 decomposition overall. The mixing row is a weak secondary resource, not a primary computational mechanism.</p>
<h3>BFS Growth Is a Braid Group Invariant (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">Demo 103</a>)</h3>
<p>If the radical does not help, does module dimension? <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">Demo 103</a> compared W_{6,0} (dim=5) against W_{6,2} (dim=9), both simple modules on B_6. The BFS depth profiles were bit-for-bit identical: 1, 11, 77, 439, 2233, 10603, 32768 — same entries at every depth, same max coefficient magnitudes, same growth ratio converging near 5x. Combined with <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">Demo 102</a>'s identical profile for W_{6,4}, all three n=6 modules produce the same BFS tree. Growth rate is a property of the braid group B_n, not the module.</p>
<p>This settles the growth law definitively. The hypothesis that higher-dimensional modules might have ~dim(W)x growth was eliminated: 9x9 matrices produce no more distinct products than 5x5 matrices at the same braid depth. The BFS catalog is the braid group's fingerprint, and the module is merely a window through which it is observed.</p>
<p>Yet dim-9 hurt XOR capacity at every level: XOR6 (2238 vs 2449), XOR8 (557 vs 850), XOR10 (0 vs 1). The curse of dimensionality in sign-hash activation was confirmed — 324 sign components (9x9 x 4) create a sparser hash space than 100 components (5x5 x 4), reducing collision-based XOR capacity. More representation dimensions means more hash bits wasted on redundant information.</p>
<p>The surprise came from the subset-hash experiment. B@sub7 — hashing 196 components from a 7x7 subblock of the 9x9 representation — produced XOR6=2538, <em>beating</em> A@full's 2449. The 7x7 subblock of W_{6,2} contains algebraic information that W_{6,0} simply does not have. B@stride3 (~108 components, every 3rd entry) achieved XOR8=767, approaching A@full's 850 while using a completely different sampling geometry. The deficit was not in the algebra; it was in how the activation function read the algebra. This set the stage for <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">Demo 104</a>'s systematic investigation of activation coarseness.</p>
<h3>The Activation Is the Bottleneck (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">Demo 104</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">Demo 104</a> asked: if the XOR deficit between dim-5 and dim-9 is a hash problem, not an algebra problem, can the hash be tuned to recover the dim-9 module's algebraic advantage?</p>
<p>The answer came in a non-monotonic curve. Sweeping component count from 10 to 324 for W_{6,2} at k=128, the XOR6 score rose to a peak at 120 components (XOR6=2486, beating W_{6,0}'s maximum 2449), then declined through the middle range, partially recovered at 300, and dropped again at 324. The <strong>Atkinson sweet spot</strong> — named by analogy to Atkinson dithering — is the optimal tradeoff between information density and hash-collision structure. Too few components loses signal; too many dilutes the useful collisions that enable XOR computation.</p>
<p>The rank analysis explained the mechanism. W_{6,0} has raw rank 100/100 — every component is linearly independent. W_{6,2} has raw rank 244/324 — 80 components are linearly dependent over Z. But sign quantization <em>expands</em> the rank: W_{6,2}'s sign-rank is 292/324, a gain of 48 independent directions. The nonlinear sign() function breaks linear dependencies that exist over Z, creating new independent ternary patterns. This <strong>sign-rank expansion</strong> is a genuinely new finding — sign quantization is not merely a lossy compression but can be an information-expanding nonlinear projection.</p>
<p>The branching decomposition provided the structural insight. Under TL_5 restriction, W_{6,2} decomposes into a through-strand piece (rows 0-4, dim=5) and an arc-bound piece (rows 5-8, dim=4). The <strong>cross-block</strong> (off-diagonal, 160 components) achieved XOR6=2412 and XOR8=952; the <strong>within-block</strong> (diagonal, 164 components) achieved only XOR6=2235. The computational signal lives in the interaction between the two TL_5 sub-pieces, not within either piece alone. The branching interaction IS the signal — at n=6.</p>
<p>But the k-sweep revealed a critical qualification. At k=4096, W_{6,0} (100 components) beat W_{6,2} cross-block (160 components) at every XOR level. The cross-block advantage at k=128 was a low-k pigeonhole artifact. Multi-hash architecture provided no improvement either. The conclusion: <strong>k (cell count) is the real lever</strong>, not hash architecture. The cross-block advantage is a better <em>activation design</em> (extracting more information per cell) but the dim-5 module has more fundamental capacity at sufficient k.</p>
<h3>Scaling to 8 Strands and the Macrame Principle (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">Demo 105</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">Demo 105</a> extended the multi-strand framework to n=8 — 14-dimensional W_{8,0} (simple, C_4=14 link states) and 28-dimensional W_{8,2} (simple, symmetric branching into two 14-dimensional blocks). The first major result: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s "XOR dies at N&gt;=7" was <strong>refuted</strong> as a k-regime artifact. At k=4096, W_{8,0} produces XOR8=22266, beating n=6's 21699 at matched k. The ratio k/2^N is the real control parameter: at k=128 for N=8, k/2^N=0.5 (deep pigeonhole regime), but at k=4096, k/2^N=16 (collision avoidance regime), and XOR is fully alive.</p>
<p>BFS growth continued the sl_d functor thesis: 14 generators on B_8 fill the catalog faster, hitting 32768 at round 5 (vs round 6 for B_6). The fourth data point — ~7x growth rate for n=8, compared to ~2x (n=3), ~3.1x (n=4), ~4x (n=5), ~5x (n=6) — now confirms the pattern across five strand counts.</p>
<p>The branching decomposition produced the arc's most unexpected result. At n=8, W_{8,2} decomposes symmetrically under TL_7 into two 14-dimensional blocks (W_{7,1} + W_{7,3}). The within-block activation (1568 components) achieved XOR6=2940, XOR8=4743; the cross-block activation (1568 components) achieved only XOR6=532, XOR8=733. Within-block dominates — the <em>opposite</em> of <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">Demo 104</a>'s n=6 finding where cross-block dominated.</p>
<p>This reversal crystallized the <strong>macrame principle</strong>: at n=6 with asymmetric blocks (dim 5+4), the sub-modules are individually too simple for rich computation, so their cross-block interaction is the dominant resource. At n=8 with symmetric blocks (dim 14+14), each sub-module is individually complex enough for self-sufficient computation, and the cross-block interaction is noise rather than signal. The crossover occurs between block dimension 5 and block dimension 14.</p>
<p>The rank saturation analysis uncovered a methodological confound that reached back across the entire multi-strand arc. W_{8,2}'s rank at 512 entries was 217/3136 (6.9%) — severely undersampled. The 34.9% match between W_{8,0} and W_{8,2} at initial checkpoints was coincidental. At 16384 entries, W_{8,2} reached raw=1096/3136 (34.9%), sign=2003/3136 (63.9%), with the sign-expansion ratio still growing at 1.83x. The lesson: single-checkpoint rank measurements are unreliable for infinite braid groups. All prior cross-module rank comparisons were confounded by varying oversampling ratios.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>18. The Entropy Null and the Relational Computation Thesis</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">Demo 106</a> tested the most natural dynamical hypothesis: do pseudo-Anosov (chaotic) braids compute XOR better than periodic (simple) ones? Thurston-Nielsen classification partitions braids by their surface dynamics — periodic braids preserve a foliation; pseudo-Anosov braids stretch and fold, with topological entropy measuring the exponential growth rate. The prediction was intuitive and wrong.</p>
<p>Both periodic (88 entries, mean score 3969) and pseudo-Anosov (39 entries, mean score 3857) braids compute XOR at 100% participation in the first 128 catalog entries. The null extended to all 8 Boolean functions tested (AND3, OR3, XOR3, MAJ3, NAND3, NOR3, AND2, XOR2), with maximum gap 3.7 percentage points — well within noise.</p>
<p>The explanation is the <strong>TL visibility filter</strong>. The TL quotient at delta=0 erases all dynamical information: e_i^2=0 kills expanding eigenvalues, and the bracket factors through TL/rad where only algebraic (not dynamical) information survives. Writhe survives the TL quotient (multiplying the bracket by (-A^3)^w), which is why writhe correlates with DKC output (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>). Entropy does not survive the quotient, so entropy is invisible to the bracket.</p>
<p>This sharpened the <strong>relational computation thesis</strong> that had been building since <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>. Across the entire DKC program, the strongest predictors of computational capacity are consistently relational/algebraic: derived series strata, cross-stratum mixing, orthogonal frame geometry, k-granularity, non-semisimplicity. Individual dynamical properties — entropy, spectral radius, writhe magnitude, word length — are consistently non-predictive or invisible. The question is never "is this braid good?" but "does this <em>collection</em> span the right algebraic structure?"</p>
<p>One elegant discovery survived: all 8 pseudo-Anosov entries at depth 2 share the Fibonacci characteristic polynomial x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x - 1 with spectral radius phi^2 = 2.618, giving entropy per crossing log(phi) = 0.481 — the theoretical optimum per Band &amp; Boyland (2007). The pseudo-Anosov fraction increases with depth from 0% (depth 1) to 77.2% (depth 8), crossing 50% at depth 5, confirming Caruso's (2013) genericity theorem. These are beautiful dynamical results. They are simply orthogonal to computation.</p>

<h2>19. The Raqiya Trilogy: Algebraic Graph Structure Predicts Parity</h2>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demos 107</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">109</a> opened a new diagnostic lens on the DKC program. Where previous demos measured <em>how much</em> computation a catalog can perform (XOR level counts) and <em>what mechanism</em> enables it (depth, writhe, null entries, cross-layer synergy), the Raqiya trilogy asked: can the algebraic <em>graph structure</em> of a value set — the web of multiplicative, additive, norm, Galois, and divisibility relationships among its elements — predict computational capability <em>before</em> running the exhaustive XOR search?</p>
<h3>The Z/4Z Axis-Alignment Theorem (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demo 107</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demo 107</a> began with a complete algebraic inventory of the 186 distinct Z[zeta_8] values produced by the 32,768-entry W_{4,2} BFS catalog. The first discovery was universal axis-alignment: every single value has exactly one nonzero cyclotomic component. Every matrix entry is of the form n<em>zeta_8^k where n is an integer and k in {0,1,2,3}. The representation </em>never* produces mixed-axis values like (1,1,0,0).</p>
<p>This is not an accident. The <strong>Z/4Z Axis-Alignment Theorem</strong> proves it constructively: TL generators have {0,1}-valued entries; braid generators give entries from {0, A, A^{-1}}; axis-aligned times axis-aligned is axis-aligned; same-axis addition preserves axis; and the bipartiteness of the link-state transition graph ensures that only same-axis values are added at each matrix position. The proof chain is watertight for ALL TL representations at delta=0.</p>
<p>The bipartiteness discovery was itself a theorem. TL link-state transition graphs — where states are non-crossing matchings and edges represent TL generator action — are bipartite for all tested n (n=2 through 6, covering 195 matchings and 6 standard modules). The bipartite 2-coloring <em>is</em> nesting count mod 2 — a <strong>Nesting Parity Z/2Z Grading</strong> verified at 195/195 matchings with zero mismatches. Independent researcher confirmation established this as genuinely novel, not a consequence of the known KLR Z-grading (Plaza-Ryom-Hansen 2013).</p>
<p>From these ingredients, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demo 107</a> derived a constructive <strong>Z/4Z phase formula</strong>: Entry(r,c) = (path_count) <em> zeta_8^{(w - 2</em>(nest(r) + nest(c))) mod 4}, where w is the writhe and nest(s) is the nesting number of link state s mod 2. Three integers — writhe, source nesting parity, target nesting parity — fully determine the cyclotomic phase of every matrix entry. DKC at delta=0 reduces to integer path counting plus a three-variable phase formula. The effective computation is Z x Z/4Z per matrix entry.</p>
<p>Two additional novel results emerged. The <strong>Major Index Bipartite Invariant</strong>: for TL standard modules W_{n,j}, the bipartite coloring equals maj mod 2 (the sum of right-endpoint positions of arcs, mod 2), verified at W_{4,2} (3/3) and W_{6,2} (9/9, the <em>only</em> winning candidate among 4 tested). And a <strong>q-Catalan identity</strong>: C_{2m+1}(-1) = (-1)^m * C_m, which gives exact bipartition class sizes for W_{n,0} modules — proved algebraically and verified against all 5 data points (n=2 through 6).</p>
<p>The orthogonality structure completed the picture. The multiplicative quotient graph on the 4 axes is K_5 — the complete graph, Z/4Z multiplication table. The additive quotient graph is a star tree centered on axis 0. Multiplication rotates across axes; addition grows within each axis. These are genuinely orthogonal operations on the cyclotomic structure.</p>
<h3>Graph Structure Predicts Parity (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">Demo 108</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">Demo 108</a> brought the Raqiya machinery to bear on the question that <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">Demo 106</a> had sharpened: if individual dynamical properties cannot predict computational capacity, can <em>relational</em> algebraic structure? The test: compare the graph structure of the 41 parity-capable values (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">Demo 50</a>'s k=6 XOR3 solutions) against the 17 poison values (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">Demo 64</a>'s k=15 orphan-only analysis) and 42 neutral values in the 100-entry Z[zeta_8] bracket catalog.</p>
<p>The result was maximum structural contrast on precisely the two channels predicted by the relational computation thesis.</p>
<p><strong>Product closure</strong> — the graph where edges connect values whose product is also in the set — showed perfect discrimination. Parity: 17 edges, 1 connected component, P_3 path structure on the axis quotient, diameter 4. Poison: <strong>zero</strong> product closure edges. No pair of poison values multiplies to another poison value. The empty graph. This is the multiplicative phase coherence channel: parity-capable values form a self-reinforcing multiplicative network; poison values are multiplicatively isolated.</p>
<p><strong>Additive v_2 connectivity</strong> — the quotient graph connecting 2-adic valuation classes through additive closure — showed near-maximum contrast. Parity connects 4/5 v_2 classes (83% density, diameter 2). Poison connects only 2/6 classes (trivial K_2). This is the additive magnitude diversity channel: parity-capable values span a rich magnitude range through their additive relationships; poison values are magnitude-impoverished.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dual-Channel Theorem</strong> crystallized: parity capability requires BOTH multiplicative phase coherence (product closure &gt; 0) AND additive magnitude diversity (v_2 connectivity &gt; trivial). Poison fails on BOTH simultaneously. The two channels measure genuinely different algebraic properties — phase rotation versus magnitude reach — and both are independently necessary. The structural parallel to quantum circuit synthesis is precise: the multiplicative channel maps to T-gate (phase) resources, and the additive channel maps to Hadamard (magnitude) resources, echoing Amy, Glaudell &amp; Ross (2023).</p>
<p>Additional discriminators sharpened the picture. Parity values have lower Galois symmetry (stabilizer gradient: 32.1% at stab=4, 41.2% at stab=2, 47.4% at stab=1 — lower symmetry correlates with higher parity capability). Parity and poison occupy nearly complementary octants of the zeta_8 circle ({2,4,5,7} vs {1,2,3,6}). Poison values show triple partition collapse — root-of-unity orbits, Galois orbits, and norm classes all coincide at 15 groups — meaning zero internal algebraic differentiation. Parity values maintain three distinct partition levels (21 root, 37 Galois, 5 v_2). Partition coincidence is an incapacity signature.</p>
<h3>Encoding-Dependent Dual-Channel Inversion (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">Demo 109</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">Demo 109</a> asked whether the dual-channel theorem generalizes to a different evaluation point. At delta=sqrt(2) (the Ising regime, A = zeta_16^5), the Z[zeta_16] bracket catalog produces 56 distinct values, all Z[i]-axial (decomposing as (a+bi)*zeta_16^axis). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_55.html">Demo 55</a> had found 9,334 parity solutions under Re&gt;0 multiplicative activation — an order of magnitude more than the 906 solutions at delta=0 under k=6 sectors.</p>
<p>The Raqiya analysis delivered a shock: <strong>7 of 8 edge types are identical</strong> between the 28 parity and 28 non-parity values. Same-axis edges, additive closure, difference closure, norm classes, v_2 classes, negation pairs, divisibility — all indistinguishable. The axis distribution (8,6,8,6) is identical. The Galois orbit count (15) is identical. The additive v_2 quotient (50%) is identical. Raqiya cannot discriminate parity from non-parity at delta=sqrt(2) on 7 of its 8 detectors.</p>
<p>The sole discriminator is product closure — and its polarity is <strong>inverted</strong>. Parity values have 56 product closure edges (14.8%), 6 connected components plus 4 isolated vertices. Non-parity values have 176 product closure edges (46.6%), a single connected component, zero isolated vertices. Non-parity has 3.1x more product edges. Compare <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">Demo 108</a> at delta=0: parity had <em>higher</em> product closure (21%) than poison (0%).</p>
<p>The <strong>Encoding-Dependent Dual-Channel Theorem</strong> resolves the inversion. Under additive encoding (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">Demo 108</a>, delta=0), parity wants HIGH product closure — values whose products land back in the vocabulary reinforce each other through superposition of their phase contributions. Under multiplicative encoding (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">Demo 109</a>, delta=sqrt(2)), parity wants LOW product closure — products must <em>escape</em> the vocabulary to enable the sector alternation required for parity classification. The dual-channel theorem holds in both regimes, but the polarity of the multiplicative channel is encoding-sensitive.</p>
<p>The symmetry at delta=sqrt(2) has a deeper explanation. At delta=0, the j=0 TL sector is dead (rad = all of V_0), yielding an impoverished algebra where structural asymmetry between parity and non-parity values is detectable. At delta=sqrt(2), the j=0 sector is alive, yielding a rich algebra where both vocabularies satisfy all structural prerequisites simultaneously — K_4 axis quotient, non-trivial v_2 connectivity, adequate additive closure. The Re&gt;0 activation suffices precisely because no structural deficits need compensating. Raqiya diagnoses algebraic <em>impoverishment</em>, not algebraic health. Where the algebra is rich, the parity/non-parity distinction becomes invisible to all single-value and most pairwise algebraic detectors, and only the encoding-dependent product closure channel remains informative.</p>

Finite group ceiling theorem: only ζ_4 and ζ_8 generate finite SU(2) subgroups under two-perpendicular-axes construction; all other roots generate infinite groups; finite groups impose hard XOR capacity ceilings (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">Demos 79</a>, 80) 41. Quantum dimension vanishing at the finite cases: [2]_q = 0 exactly at ζ_8 and ζ_4; finite-group roots are the singular (lattice) points of quantum group parameter space where Kuperberg hardness does not apply (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">Demo 80</a>) 42. Logarithmic scaling law: max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog_size) + 4.6 for ζ_12; each +2 XOR inputs costs ~10× more entries (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_81.html">Demo 81</a>) 43. Linear depth law: max_xor ≈ depth + 6; crossing depth in the knot-theory sense is the fundamental variable governing XOR capacity, with the logarithmic law a corollary of exponential catalog growth per depth unit (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">Demo 82</a>) 44. Algebraic coherence dominance: deep entries (fewer directions and angles) outperform stride-sampled entries (full vocabulary) by 2 XOR levels at equal catalog size (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">Demo 82</a>) 45. Framing as discrete computational resource: Jones normalization costs exactly 2 XOR levels at both ζ₈ and ζ₁₂; the "N-2 pattern" from early demos was the Jones polynomial's capacity all along; what TQFT calls a framing anomaly is what DKC computes with (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>) 46. Resource decomposition of DKC power: three independent additive axes — lattice base (XOR6), crossing depth (+2 per closure round), and writhe/framing (+2) — each contributing the same discrete increment; writhe and depth are confirmed independent (r=0.14) (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>) 47. Angular vocabulary as the framing mechanism: Jones normalization destroys 28% of angle count (43 → 31 at ζ₁₂) while leaving direction count unchanged (512 → 512); framing lives in how quaternions rotate, not where they point (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">Demo 83</a>) 48. Bracket-null indispensability theorem: the 9 bracket-null entries (Re(q)=0) in the ζ₈ catalog cannot be removed without destroying XOR capacity; they contribute 6 exclusive S² directions (cube-edge midpoints) absent from non-null entries, and removing them performs worse than removing random entries of equal count (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>) 49. S¹ flatness of null entries: all bracket-null entries have half-angle = 90°, a single point on S¹; their entire computational contribution comes from S² directional diversity rather than angular discrimination; confirmed by flat k_sec sweep across k=1 through k=8 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>) 50. Non-semisimplicity as the computational resource: ζ₄ (semisimple, δ=2) has 75% null entries and zero XOR capacity; ζ₈ (non-semisimple, δ=0) achieves full capacity; the radical provides both the null-entry directional infrastructure and the Jordan-block memory mechanism for depth scaling (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>) 51. Null efficiency amplification (3× cost): the non-null-only subset reaches XOR8 but requires k_sec = 16–20 (vs k=6 for the full catalog); null entries reduce the angular resolution cost of XOR discrimination by a factor of approximately 3; nulls are "efficiency amplifiers," not dead weight (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>) 52. Pure synergy in DKC: neither null-only nor non-null-only subsets can compute XOR6 at k_sec=1 alone; their union achieves 36 winners; the k_sec=1 result is a pure-synergy (Williams &amp; Beer 2010) instance — the computational contribution of each part is zero, but the combination is non-zero; the DKC manifestation of LCFT Jordan-cell coupling ⟨T|t⟩ = b (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">Demo 84</a>) 53. First exact computation of b = -5/8 from diagram algebra at TL_4; resolves GRS/PR normalization controversy via dim(V_0)^2 multiplicity factor; fixed-point form gauge manifold shown to be flat with 3-dimensional gauge freedom (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">Demo 85</a>) 54. Novel negative result: delta-form divergence on single P_{0,0} at every eigenvalue and lattice size; multiplicity from regular representation is structurally essential to b extraction, not a removable scale factor (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">Demo 86</a>) 55. Regime Transition Theorem for null indispensability: null entries transition from computationally critical (ζ₈, finite group) to computationally dispensable (ζ₁₂, infinite group); direction density is the controlling variable (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">Demo 87</a>) 56. Two-Role Direction Theorem: non-null body-diagonal directions are rigid computational anchors; null edge-midpoint directions are flexible scaffolding; prediction (null more sensitive) was inverted by computation (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">Demo 88</a>) 57. K-ladder resilience: the Sec×Vor activation provides 14× better perturbation robustness than Voronoi-only; same activation introduced for capacity (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">D77</a>) also provides robustness — dual benefit (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">Demo 88</a>) 58. Five candidate depth law mechanisms killed in a single demo: pairwise coherence, direction coverage, Cayley density, sector saturation, and deep-shell angle coherence all eliminated as explanations for the linear depth law (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_89.html">Demo 89</a>) 59. Axis cancellation mechanism for the depth law: XOR winners select anti-aligned quaternion pairs; partial cancellation of opposite rotation axes produces low sum angles that create fine-grained sector discrimination (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">Demo 90</a>) 60. Spectral inversion: S² point cloud bandwidth DECREASES with depth while computation improves; the depth law is relational (how entries combine), not positional (where entries sit); rules out all positional/bandwidth explanations (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">Demo 90</a>) 61. Parity Wall Theorem: max_xor at a given depth is activation-independent; resolution controls solution count but not existence; the linear depth law is a property of the parity constraint, not activation geometry (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">Demo 91</a>) 62. Balanced exponentials linearity: the depth law arises from the ratio of BFS vocabulary growth (~2×/round) to parity demand growth (4×/weight); confirmed from both supply and demand sides across a three-demo arc (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_89.html">Demos 89</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">91</a>) 63. Parity-Lock Theorem: the ±q encoding is structurally locked to parity functions via the (0,0)≡(1,1) collision; AND/OR/MAJ/threshold have zero winners at all depths; the depth law describes scaling for the ONLY achievable function family under this encoding; <strong>FORMALLY PROVEN</strong> (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">Demo 92</a>, P04) 64. Cross-layer synergy mechanism: neither COMM nor NON-COMM carries disproportionate XOR capacity; computational power emerges from cross-layer interaction between derived series strata; 0+0=26% at matched geometry (same 90-degree half-angle, different algebraic origin) (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">Demo 95</a>) 65. Two independent stratifications: the <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> null/non-null partition and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">D95</a> derived series are independent, creating a 5-cell 2D landscape; optimal z8 catalog is A+B+C (21 entries), not ALL (24); Q8-null entries are noise that actively degrades capacity (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_96.html">Demo 96</a>) 66. Cross-derived synergy principle: non-null entries from different derived levels produce maximum synergy; B+C dominates all pairwise combinations at every N (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_96.html">Demo 96</a>) 67. Geometric perfection thesis: Cell B's 100% XOR arises from octahedral geometry (3 mutually orthogonal directions) with a 50-degree robust plateau (25-75 degrees); the lever arm mechanism links nonzero real component to phase_cell discrimination (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_97.html">Demo 97</a>) 68. Readout bottleneck thesis: 3-strand algebra is rich (infinite group, 2048 entries) but trace readout is catastrophically lossy (5.1% retention, zero XOR); column-4 is lossless (100% retention) (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">Demo 98</a>) 69. First 3-strand XOR computation: Delta_1 standard module with 16-component sign-pattern activation achieves XOR6=500K+, XOR8=48K+, XOR10=485, XOR12=16, XOR14=60; Fibonacci growth in max_abs; Jordan block proves infinite group (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">Demo 99</a>) 70. Ext^1 catalytic preparation thesis: non-split extension Ext^1(L(0), L(1)) is the computational resource; two-regime discovery (combinatorial XOR6-8 vs algebraic XOR10-14); super-hub star graph topology with irreplaceable core (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">Demo 99</a>) 71. sl_d functor growth rate confirmed across three data points: BFS growth ~2x (3-strand), ~3.1x (4-strand), ~4x (5-strand), tracking n-1 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">Demo 98</a>/100/101) 72. Non-semisimple extension is computationally load-bearing: W_{4,2} (non-semisimple, radical dim=9) achieves XOR14=70; W_{5,3} (simple, no radical) achieves XOR14=0; the radical provides degrees of freedom for the hardest computations (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">Demos 100</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">101</a>) 73. Casimir-XOR correlation inversion: in non-semisimple modules winners have higher Casimir (1.36x-1.86x); in simple modules the correlation inverts at high XOR levels (0.54x-0.89x); simple modules compute differently (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">Demos 100</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">101</a>) 74. Traceless hub commutator universality: all hub commutators across <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a> (2 hubs), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a> (6 hubs), and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a> (3 hubs) are traceless; <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a> hubs mutually commute (zero matrix commutators) (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">Demos 99</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">101</a>) 75. Barrington-Radical Principle: the radical of a non-semisimple TL module at delta=0 carries an abelian writhe character (B_n -&gt; Z/8Z); by Barrington's theorem, provably useless for parity; simple module W_{6,0} outperforms non-simple W_{6,4} at every XOR level despite identical dimension (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">Demo 102</a>) 76. Writhe Character Theorem: M<em>r = A^{writhe(M)}</em>r for ALL 32,768 catalog entries of W_{6,4}; radical content (L1 norm of M*r) = 3 for every entry; the radical carries only framing data (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">Demo 102</a>) 77. BFS growth is a braid group invariant: W_{6,0} (dim=5), W_{6,2} (dim=9), and W_{6,4} (dim=5, non-simple) all produce bit-for-bit identical BFS depth profiles on B_6; growth rate ~(n-1)x is a property of B_n, not the module; sl_d functor thesis now confirmed across five strand counts (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">Demos 102</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">103</a>, extending 98/100/101) 78. Curse of dimensionality in sign-hash activation: higher module dimension (324 vs 100 sign components) creates sparser hash space that reduces XOR capacity; the deficit is in the readout, not the algebra (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">Demo 103</a>) 79. Atkinson sweet spot: non-monotonic component-count curve for sign-hash activation; W_{6,2} peaks at 120/324 components (XOR6=2486, beating W_{6,0}'s 2449); optimal information-per-collision tradeoff (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">Demo 104</a>) 80. Sign-rank expansion: sign quantization can INCREASE effective rank; W_{6,2} raw rank 244, sign-rank 292 — the nonlinear sign() function breaks 48 linear dependencies that exist over Z; the first demonstration that 1-bit quantization is information-expanding, not merely information-compressing (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">Demo 104</a>) 81. Branching interaction IS the computational signal (at n=6): cross-block activation (160 off-diagonal components) outperforms within-block (164 diagonal components) and full (324) at matched k; the interaction between TL_{n-1} sub-pieces is the computational resource for asymmetric decomposition (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">Demo 104</a>) 82. k (cell count) is the real lever: multi-hash architecture provides no improvement over single-hash; increasing k is the primary scaling mechanism; the cross-block advantage at low k vanishes at high k (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">Demo 104</a>) 83. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s "XOR dies at N&gt;=7" refuted as k-regime artifact: at k=4096, W_{8,0} produces XOR8=22266 (n=8 beats n=6's 21699 at matched k); the ratio k/2^N is the real control parameter (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">Demo 105</a>) 84. Macrame principle: branching interaction regime transition between n=6 (cross-block dominates, asymmetric blocks dim 5+4) and n=8 (within-block dominates, symmetric blocks dim 14+14); simple blocks need connections, complex blocks are self-sufficient (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">Demo 105</a>) 85. Rank saturation confound: single-checkpoint rank measurements are unreliable for infinite braid groups; all prior cross-module rank comparisons confounded by varying oversampling ratios (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">Demo 105</a>) 86. Topological entropy null: both periodic and pseudo-Anosov braids compute XOR at 100% participation with near-identical scores; entropy classification is orthogonal to ALL 8 Boolean functions tested; the TL visibility filter at delta=0 erases all dynamical information (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">Demo 106</a>) 87. Z/4Z Axis-Alignment Theorem: every entry of a braid representation matrix over a TL module at delta=0 is axis-aligned (exactly one nonzero cyclotomic component); proven constructively via TL generator structure + bipartite link-state graph (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demo 107</a>) 88. Nesting Parity Z/2Z Grading: nesting count mod 2 equals the bipartite 2-coloring for all TL link-state transition graphs; verified at 195 matchings across n=2 through 6; confirmed novel relative to KLR Z-grading (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demo 107</a>) 89. Z/4Z constructive phase formula: Entry(r,c) = (path_count) <em> zeta_8^{(w - 2</em>(nest(r) + nest(c))) mod 4}; DKC at delta=0 reduces to integer path counting plus three-variable phase formula (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demo 107</a>) 90. Major Index Bipartite Invariant: for TL standard modules W_{n,j}, the bipartite coloring equals maj mod 2; verified at W_{4,2} and W_{6,2}; generalizes nesting parity (the j=0 case) (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demo 107</a>) 91. q-Catalan identity: C_{2m+1}(-1) = (-1)^m * C_m; gives exact bipartition class sizes for W_{n,0} modules; proved algebraically (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demo 107</a>) 92. Orthogonality Theorem: multiplicative quotient graph on Z[zeta_8] axes = K_5 (Z/4Z multiplication); additive quotient graph = star tree; multiplication rotates axes, addition preserves axes (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">Demo 107</a>) 93. Dual-Channel Theorem: parity capability requires BOTH multiplicative phase coherence (product closure &gt; 0) AND additive magnitude diversity (v_2 connectivity &gt; trivial); poison fails on BOTH simultaneously; maps onto T-gate/Hadamard decomposition in quantum circuit synthesis (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">Demo 108</a>) 94. Product closure as parity discriminator: maximum structural contrast — parity has 17 edges (connected), poison has 0 edges (empty graph); the strongest single-feature parity predictor in the DKC program (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">Demo 108</a>) 95. Partition coincidence as incapacity signature: triple collapse (root=Galois=norm at 15 groups) is a structural fingerprint of computational incapacity in the Z[zeta_8] catalog (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">Demo 108</a>) 96. Encoding-Dependent Dual-Channel Theorem: under additive encoding, parity wants HIGH product closure (self-reinforcement); under multiplicative encoding, parity wants LOW product closure (vocabulary escape for sector alternation); the polarity flips with encoding type (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">Demos 108</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">109</a>) 97. Perfect algebraic symmetry at delta=sqrt(2): parity and non-parity are structurally indistinguishable on 7/8 edge types; Raqiya diagnoses algebraic impoverishment, not algebraic health (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">Demo 109</a>) 98. j=0 liveness implies structural universality: at delta=0 (j=0 dead), structural asymmetry is detectable; at delta!=0 (j=0 alive), both vocabularies satisfy all prerequisites and only encoding-dependent product closure discriminates (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">Demo 109</a>)</p>
<p>No prior work connects these fields. The intersection is genuinely unoccupied. The question "can topological invariants be compiled into neural network weights?" has no direct precedent in the literature. One hundred and nine demos prove the answer is yes — and map the exact boundary of what is computable, characterize the algebraic structure of the computation, establish how that computation scales, decompose its sources into independent resources, explain the mechanism of the depth law, prove that the ±q encoding is structurally locked to parity, and now show that algebraic graph structure predicts which value sets can compute parity before any exhaustive search is run. That boundary is not just algebraic: it has a geometric layer (the wall at k=23), a topological layer (the 24-cell), a differential-geometric layer (the S² Hopf base), a spectral layer (bandwidth l=6), a group-theoretic layer (only ζ_4 and ζ_8 generate finite SU(2) subgroups), a depth layer (crossing depth governs capacity linearly), a framing layer (the writhe phase the Jones polynomial normalizes away contributes exactly 2 XOR levels), an indecomposability layer (b = -5/8 computed from first principles, resolving the LCFT normalization controversy), an encoding layer (the ±q paired input is parity-locked by formal proof), and now a diagnostic layer (the Raqiya dual-channel theorem discriminates parity-capable from parity-incapable value sets via product closure and v_2 connectivity). The parity function, unreachable by split-sigmoid, requires exactly 13 angular directions on a sphere — a number simultaneously equal to the DOF count for the answer, the number of vertices of the binary octahedral group, and the minimum bandwidth index for S² reconstruction. None of these coincidences are accidental. The computation is additive, group-breaking, and algebraically coherent. It does not approximate; it is exact. Its power decomposes into three independent additive resources: lattice structure, crossing depth, and writhe. Its directional vocabulary requires bracket-null entries that are invisible to the scalar invariant but indispensable for higher-capacity computation at finite groups — a concrete realization of the LCFT prediction that null states carry computational content through Jordan-cell coupling, with null indispensability itself a regime-dependent phenomenon that transitions away as the group grows to infinite order. The depth law is relational, not positional: deep entries compose better because axis cancellation creates favorable sum-angle structure, not because they occupy special positions on S². The mechanism is confirmed from both supply and demand sides: BFS vocabulary growth balances parity constraint difficulty to produce a linear law. And the ±q encoding channels everything into parity — the single Boolean function outside AC⁰ — making the depth law a parity-specific scaling result. For infinite-group roots of unity, DKC scales logarithmically without a ceiling. The internal structure of the z8 group decomposes into two independent stratifications whose 2D cross-product creates a 5-cell synergy landscape, where cross-layer interaction (not individual strata) carries computational power. Optimal catalog pruning improves capacity: quality over quantity. The multi-strand frontier extends DKC from quaternionic to matrix-valued computation. The 3-strand Delta_1 module produces the first-ever multi-strand XOR (up to XOR14), with Fibonacci growth and an Ext^1 catalytic preparation mechanism operating through a two-regime phase transition. BFS growth rate tracks n-1 across five strand counts (n=3,4,5,6,8), confirming the sl_d functor thesis — and the comparison at n=6 between three modules of varying dimension and semisimplicity proves that BFS growth is a braid group invariant, not a module property. The radical extension is computationally load-bearing at the XOR14 boundary, but the Barrington-Radical Principle establishes that the radical's abelian writhe character is provably useless for parity — the radical carries framing data, not computational degrees of freedom. The activation function, not the algebraic structure, remains the consistent bottleneck: the macrame principle shows that branching interaction dominance reverses between asymmetric (n=6) and symmetric (n=8) block decompositions, sign-rank expansion reveals that 1-bit quantization can be information-expanding rather than merely lossy, and the k-regime theory unifies the apparent contradictions across strand counts into a single control parameter k/2^N. Topological entropy — the dynamical property that governs mixing in physical braids — is completely orthogonal to DKC computation, killed by the TL visibility filter at delta=0. And the Raqiya algebraic graph analysis trilogy closes the diagnostic loop: at delta=0 where the algebra is impoverished, the dual-channel theorem discriminates parity from poison with maximum structural contrast on two orthogonal channels (multiplicative product closure and additive v_2 connectivity). At delta=sqrt(2) where the algebra is rich, the discrimination collapses to a single encoding-dependent channel with inverted polarity. The algebraic graph structure of a value set is a diagnostic for algebraic impoverishment, not algebraic health — and the encoding determines which direction the product closure must point for parity to be achievable.</p>
