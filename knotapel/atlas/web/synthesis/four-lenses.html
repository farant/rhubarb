    <h1>Four Lenses on One Object</h1>
<p>The DKC research is one thing seen from four directions. These are not four research programs that happen to share data. They are four coordinate systems on the same manifold. Every major result lives in at least two lenses; the deepest results live in all four.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>Lens 1: Representation Theory</h2>
<p><strong>What the research looks like:</strong> The Temperley-Lieb algebra TL_n(delta) at roots of unity is a non-semisimple finite-dimensional algebra whose radical structure controls what the Kauffman bracket can and cannot compute. The radical is not noise. It is the precise algebraic object that separates computable from incomputable Boolean functions.</p>
<p><strong>Central demos:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_35.html">D35</a> (TL_n matrices over Z[zeta_8], the keystone), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_39.html">D39</a> (Parts G-J: three Gram forms, Markov RT truncation, next-level radical formula), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_51.html">D51</a> (radical anatomy at delta=0 -- the sandwich theorem, Loewy length 3, Catalan trace theorem, Peirce block matching), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_52.html">D52</a> (Chebyshev generalization across ell=2-6, universal nilpotency 3, cross-ell radical dimension formulas), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_06.html">D06</a> (Jones-Wenzl idempotents as module projectors), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">D86</a> (indecomposability parameter b = -5/8, projective cover structure, standard module diagonalizability), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> (Barrington-Radical Principle -- writhe character, radical guaranteed useless for parity), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> (8-strand modules, macrame principle regime transition), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> (Z/4Z axis-alignment proof, nesting parity grading, q-Catalan identity, major index bipartite invariant).</p>
<p><strong>Core results belonging to this lens:</strong> <ul> <li>The sandwich theorem: rad^2(TL_{2k}(0)) is isomorphic to TL_{2k-1}(0) as a bimodule. Three Loewy layers with dimensional mirrors.</li> <li>Alternating semisimplicity: odd n is semisimple, even n is not. TL_3(0) is semisimple despite nilpotent generators.</li> <li>Universal nilpotency 3: rad^3 = 0 at ALL roots of unity tested (ell=2-6). The cellularity of TL algebras forces this.</li> <li>Fibonacci rank theorem: the total bilinear rank of the rad^2 generator equals F(ell-1). Fibonacci numbers arise from fusion rules in the Bratteli diagram.</li> <li>Cross-ell radical dimension formulas: rad(TL_ell) = 2ell-3, rad(TL_{ell+1}) = ell^2-ell-3.</li> <li>Markov RT truncation: Markov trace kills j &gt;= ell-1, preserves j &lt;= ell-2. The "shadow interpretation": fixpt = algebraic light, Markov = topological light.</li> <li>Next-level radical formula: rad(TL_{ell+1}) = ell^2-ell-3, now formally proven.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>New results (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a>):</strong> <ul> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> Barrington-Radical Principle (NAMED THEOREM): the radical of a non-semisimple TL module at delta=0 carries an abelian character -- the writhe homomorphism B_n -&gt; Z/8Z (via A = -zeta_8). By Barrington's theorem (1989), abelian groups cannot compute parity. Therefore the radical direction is theoretically guaranteed useless for XOR computation. Computationally confirmed: simple W_{6,0} beats non-simple W_{6,4} at EVERY XOR level (XOR6: 2449 vs 2370, XOR8: 850 vs 793, XOR10: 1 vs 0) despite same dimension (both dim=5). The Writhe Character Theorem is proven for ALL 32,768 catalog entries: M<em>r = A^{writhe(M)}</em>r. Radical content is exactly constant (=3) across the entire catalog. This is the sharpest characterization of what the radical IS computationally: it is a frozen 1-dimensional writhe counter, carrying abelian (hence parity-useless) information.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> BFS growth independence (CONFIRMED at n=6): W_{6,0} (dim=5, simple) and W_{6,4} (dim=5, non-simple, rad dim=1) produce bit-for-bit IDENTICAL BFS depth profiles (1, 11, 77, 439, 2233, 10603, 32768). Growth rate ~5x converging, consistent with sl_5 thesis. Growth is a property of the braid group B_n, not the module.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> Fibonacci max-abs in non-simple modules: W_{6,4} max coefficient magnitude follows strict Fibonacci (1,1,2,3,5,8,13) through depth 6, while W_{6,0} breaks to 16 at depth 6. The radical constrains coefficient growth -- a structural consequence of the abelian writhe character acting as a scaling bound on the radical direction.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> macrame principle (CONJECTURED regime transition): branching interaction behavior reverses between small and large sub-module blocks. At n=6 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a>, asymmetric blocks dim 5+4), cross-block (off-diagonal branching) dominates XOR capacity. At n=8 (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>, symmetric blocks dim 14+14), within-block dominates (XOR6: within=2940 vs cross=532). Crossover regime between dim 5 and dim 14. Named by analogy: simple knots need connections (edges) for computational fabric; complex knots are self-sufficient (nodes).</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> 8-strand XOR revival: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s "XOR dies at N&gt;=7" is REFUTED as a k-regime artifact. W_{8,0} at k=4096 produces XOR8=22266, beating n=6's 21699 at matched k. The ratio k/2^N is the real control parameter. Growth rate for B_8 is ~7x (14 generators), confirming the sl_d thesis at a fourth strand count (3-&gt;2x, 4-&gt;3.1x, 5-&gt;4x, 6-&gt;5x, 8-&gt;~7x).</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> rank saturation methodology (ESTABLISHED): single-checkpoint rank measurements are unreliable for infinite braid groups. Must report saturation curves at multiple checkpoints. Retroactive analysis shows W_{8,0} at 32768 entries: raw=710/784 (90.6%), sign=767/784 (97.8%). W_{8,2} at 16384 entries: raw=1096/3136 (34.9%), sign=2003/3136 (63.9%), sign expansion 1.83x and still growing. All prior cross-module rank comparisons were confounded by varying oversampling ratios.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> Z/4Z Axis-Alignment Theorem (PROVEN): every entry of a braid representation matrix over a TL module at delta=0 is axis-aligned (exactly one nonzero cyclotomic component). Proof chain: (1) TL generators have {0,1} entries, (2) braid generators give entries from {0, A, A^{-1}}, (3) axis-aligned * axis-aligned = axis-aligned, (4) same-axis addition preserves axis, (5) bipartiteness of TL link-state graphs ensures only same-axis values are added at each matrix position. This upgrades the axiality result from empirical (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_35.html">D35</a>) to proven.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> Nesting Parity Z/2Z Grading (NOVEL THEOREM): the bipartite 2-coloring of TL link-state transition graphs IS nesting count mod 2. Verified for ALL n=2,3,4,5,6 (195 matchings, 0 mismatches). Researcher confirmed this is NOT a consequence of the known KLR Z-grading (Plaza-Ryom-Hansen 2013) -- it is a genuinely novel algebraic structure on TL modules.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> constructive Z/4Z phase formula: Entry(r,c) = (integer path count) <em> zeta_8^{(w - 2</em>(nest(r) + nest(c))) mod 4}. Three numbers (writhe, nesting of source state, nesting of target state) fully determine the cyclotomic phase. This reduces DKC at delta=0 to integer path counting + phase lookup: effective computation is Z x Z/4Z per matrix entry.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> Major Index Bipartite Invariant (CONJECTURED for general n,j): for TL standard modules W_{n,j}, the bipartite invariant is maj mod 2 = sum of right-endpoint positions of arcs, mod 2. Verified at W_{4,2} (3/3) and W_{6,2} (9/9 -- the ONLY winning candidate out of 4 tested). For full matchings (j=0), maj mod 2 = nest mod 2 (special case).</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> q-Catalan Identity (PROVEN algebraically): C_{2m+1}(-1) = (-1)^m * C_m. Gives exact bipartition class sizes for W_{n,0} modules. Verified against all 5 data points (n=2,3,4,5,6).</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> Orthogonality Theorem: multiplicative quotient graph on 186 distinct Z[zeta_8] values = K_5 (Z/4Z multiplication table, complete 4-regular), additive quotient graph = star tree centered on 0 (axis-preserving). Multiplication = Z/4Z rotation across axes; addition = growth within each axis.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Open questions specific to this lens:</strong> <ul> <li>The Galois symmetry conjecture: does the sandwich duality (top isomorphic to bottom) correspond to a Galois automorphism of Gal(Q(zeta_8)/Q)?</li> <li>Palindromic sector rank conjecture for even ell.</li> <li>ell=7 predictions: first cubic number field case, would validate all universal formulas. <strong>CONFIRMED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_60.html">D60</a>).</strong></li> <li>~~Is there a generator construction that reaches E₆ (binary tetrahedral) and E₈ (binary icosahedral)?~~ E₈ (binary icosahedral, 2I) reached in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a> via direct construction with generators s = (1+i+j+k)/2 and t = (phi + phi_inv*i + j)/2. E₆ (binary tetrahedral) remains open.</li> <li>Power-of-two finiteness conjecture: are the finite cases exactly angles π/2^k for k ≥ 1? ζ₃₂ (θ = π/16) is the next untested prediction.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>New results (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>):</strong> <ul> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a> complement-blindness theorem: combined_cell's |qa| normalization identifies S with -S, killing all non-complement-invariant functions under 1wpi encoding. Phase_cell (no sign flip) recovers all 13 NPN classes. The complement-blindness is a representation-theoretic constraint arising from the quaternionic S → -S symmetry in the half-sphere identification.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a> binary icosahedral group (2I, E₈, order 120): constructed via Z[sqrt5] exact arithmetic. 9 conjugacy classes, 31 distinct S² directions (vs 13 for z8). BFS closure in 7 rounds with symmetric diamond depth profile (5,8,11,12,11,8,4,1). The unique non-solvable finite SU(2) subgroup — the ADE classification endpoint. At matched catalog size, 2I outperforms solvable z8, confirming Barrington's theorem prediction. The E₈ lattice (icosian ring) connects 2I to the densest lattice packing in 8 dimensions.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>New results (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">D95</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_97.html">D97</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a>):</strong> <ul> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">D95</a> derived series of z8: 24 &gt; 12 &gt; 4 &gt; 1, corresponding exactly to the ADE chain 2O &gt; 2T &gt; Q8 &gt; {±1} (E₇ &gt; E₆ &gt; D₄ &gt; A₁). First direct computation of this group-theoretic partition in the DKC context. Cross-layer synergy: neither COMM (12 entries, 2T) nor NON-COMM (12 entries, coset) carries disproportionate capacity; the 2.7x boost from ALL(24) over either 12-element subset demonstrates cross-stratum interference. The 2I comparison shows perfect groups avoid stratification overhead entirely (60/60 are commutators).</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_96.html">D96</a> two independent stratifications: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>'s null/non-null and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">D95</a>'s derived series are independent, confirmed by cross-tabulation and connected to the character table of 2O (Kirillov-Ostrik 2002, 8 conjugacy classes). The 5-cell landscape maps onto E₇ Dynkin diagram structure through representation-theoretic (TL radical) and group-theoretic (derived series) pathways that are independent at the element level but unified at the categorical level.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_97.html">D97</a> octahedral geometry of Cell B: the 6 D0-nonnull entries form a regular octahedron on S² (the dual of the cube, one of the 24-cell's constituent polytopes). The lever arm mechanism -- nonzero real component enables phase_cell discrimination -- connects quaternion geometry to computational readout.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a> Delta_1 standard module: 2x2 indecomposable over Z[zeta_8] with non-split extension Ext^1(L(0), L(1)). Jordan block proves infinite braid group image despite TL_3 semisimplicity (n=3 odd, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_51.html">D51</a>). Super-hub commutator has strong sl_2 bracket structure (Cartan L1=84). All entries have unit determinant -- representation is in SL_2(Z[zeta_8]).</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a> W_{4,2} non-semisimple standard module: radical dim=9, Loewy length 3, extension 0→L_{4,4}→W_{4,2}→L_{4,2}→0. Radical direction r=(1,0,-1) preserved at all depths (constant radical content). Hub commutators annihilate the radical -- live in the semisimple quotient.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a> W_{5,3} simple standard module: no radical (n=5 odd), 4-dimensional. Demonstrates that DKC computes even on simple modules, but with strictly less deep capacity (XOR14=0) than non-semisimple modules (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a>'s XOR14=70). All three hubs mutually commute (zero matrix commutators) -- live in a commutative subalgebra.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>New results (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">D69</a>):</strong> <ul> <li>Quaternionic / SU(2) representation of braids: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a> proves that the SU(2) braid representation with generators σ₁ → (1+i)/√2, σ₂ → (1−k)/√2 maps the braid group to exactly the 24 vertices of the 24-cell (binary octahedral group, 48 elements with negatives). This is a direct representation-theoretic object sitting above the scalar bracket.</li> <li>The bracket is the trace of this SU(2) representation after Markov normalization. The 24-cell is the image of the braid group under the quaternionic representation, explaining why the bracket catalog has 100 values but only 24 underlying quaternionic states.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_69.html">D69</a> proves the Direction Nesting Theorem: for any N, all SU(2) eigenvector directions in the ζ<em>N catalog appear identically in the ζ</em>{2N} catalog. Algebraic proof: squaring a quaternion preserves its rotation axis. Computationally verified ζ_8 → ζ_16 at 13/13 directions with 0.000° angular drift.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a> connects the representation space to spectral theory: the 13 eigenvector directions of the binary octahedral group are a spectral basis for spherical harmonics up to l=6 on S². The 13=13 theorem (2l+1=13 at l=6) is a representation-theoretic fact about the binary octahedral group's direction count.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>New results (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a>):</strong> <ul> <li>ADE classification confirmed computationally: ζ₄ generates the binary dihedral group 2D₂ (order 8, D-series in ADE), and ζ₈ generates the binary octahedral group 2O (order 48, E₇ in ADE). These are the only two finite groups reachable under the two-perpendicular-axes generator construction.</li> <li>The quantum dimension [2]_q = q + q⁻¹ = i + (−i) = 0 at ζ₈ (q = i): ζ₈ is the most singular point in quantum group parameter space — the one finite exceptional case where the quantum dimension vanishes entirely.</li> <li>The non-monotone finiteness boundary (ζ₄ finite, ζ₆ infinite, ζ₈ finite, all others infinite) shows that algebraic degree of cos(π/N) does not predict finiteness. The finite cases are exactly the angles that are symmetries of the cube/octahedron.</li> <li>E₆ (binary tetrahedral) and E₈ (binary icosahedral) are not reachable under the tested generator construction; the ADE exhaustion for the DKC construction stops at E₇.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">D74</a> incomparability theorem: the DKC Voronoi cell and the Kauffman bracket are incomparable braid invariants — neither subsumes the other. At the braid level, 97.8% of bracket collisions are separated by cell; at the catalog level, 80% are separated. The combination yields 119 equivalence classes vs 100 bracket-alone and 14 cell-alone (+19% finer). Six distinct computational type vectors capture the DKC orbit structure.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> additive-not-multiplicative: the multiplicative braid product formulation (using the braid as a group element) is structurally incapable of computing XOR6. The complement-all-bits map sends M → M⁻¹ which shares the same eigenvector cell, making parity invisible. The additive weight sum formulation computes XOR6 at 82.8% universal determinism — a structural constant identical across all 36 winning triples, following from the binary octahedral group acting transitively on the 13 directions.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>New results (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>):</strong> <ul> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> Jones normalization as framing information loss: Jones normalization removes the writhe-dependent phase factor (−A³)^{−w}, stripping exactly the framing information that distinguishes the bracket from the Jones polynomial. From the representation-theory perspective, this is removal of a character-valued class function on the braid group: the writhe phase is a 1-dimensional representation (the abelianization of the braid group), and its removal collapses the writh-graded module structure. Jones XOR capacity = bracket XOR capacity − 2 at every tested root — the 2-level loss is the dimension of the writhe grading discarded.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a> non-semisimplicity as the computational resource: at ζ₄ (semisimple TL algebra, [2]_q = ±2), the catalog has 4 entries of which 3 are bracket-null — 75% null fraction and only XOR6 capacity. The semisimple case has nearly trivial structure. At ζ₈ (non-semisimple, [2]_q = 0), 37.5% null fraction and XOR8 capacity — the radical and its null states are not dead weight but the computational resource. The LCFT interpretation: bracket-null entries (Re(q) = 0) are the analogs of LCFT null states — zero two-point function but nonzero vectors. Their logarithmic partners (non-null entries on the same S² direction, the 3 shared coordinate-axis directions) carry computational content through the Jordan-cell coupling. The 6 null-only directions (cube-edge-midpoints) have no logarithmic partner — removing them (by removing the null entries) collapses XOR capacity from 8 to 6. Non-semisimplicity creates the Jordan-cell structure; Jordan cells are the mechanism of the null-state computational contribution.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>New results (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">D86</a>):</strong> <ul> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a> indecomposability parameter b = -5/8 computed from first principles: the Pearce-Rasmussen indecomposability parameter for dense polymers at delta=0 is computed exactly at TL_4 via leading-coefficient extraction from the delta-parameterized Markov trace on the full 14-dimensional regular representation. b_delta = -5/2 on the regular rep; normalizing by dim(0-TL sector) = 4 gives b_PR = -5/8, exact to 12 decimal places. The "controversy" between b = -2 (GRS quantum group convention) and b = -5/8 (PR lattice convention) dissolves: both are correct under different normalization.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a> standard modules are fully diagonalizable: the Hamiltonian H on the standard module W_{n,0} (link states) has NO Jordan blocks at any tested size (n=4,6,8,10,12). The minimal polynomial is square-free at every size. Jordan blocks exist exclusively on projective covers P_{0,0} and the full regular representation. This falsifies claims that b is extracted from standard module Jordan structure — the non-semisimple structure is confined to the projective cover level.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a> projective cover P_{0,0} Jordan blocks at nonzero eigenvalues: TL_4 P_{0,0} (dim=5, composition 0-TL:2 + 2-TL:3) has Jordan blocks at lambda = +/-sqrt(2), not at lambda = 0. The characteristic polynomial x(x^2-2)^2 reveals the non-semisimple structure. P_{0,0} dimensions follow the next-Catalan pattern: C_3=5 at TL_4, C_4=14 at TL_6, C_5=42 at TL_8.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a> valuation condition and TL_6 divergence: the leading-coefficient method requires p_tt = 2<em>p_Tt (minimum delta-powers in the bilinear forms). At TL_4 this is satisfied (2 = 2</em>1); at TL_6 it fails (4 != 6), causing b to diverge as delta^{-2}. The 25-fold multiplicity (dim(0-TL for TL_6)^2 = 25) introduces cross-copy interference that violates the valuation balance.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a> fixed-point form gauge analysis: the fixpt-trace bilinear form at TL_4 has 3-dimensional gauge freedom with a purely affine b landscape (M=0, E=0). Both -2 and -5/8 are reachable points on this flat manifold. The delta-parameterized Markov trace form breaks the degeneracy and selects b = -5/8.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">D86</a> universal divergence on single P_{0,0}: the delta-parameterized Gram matrix approach diverges on every single projective cover at every eigenvalue and every lattice size tested. The multiplicity from the regular representation is structurally essential — not a removable scale factor but a participant in the valuation balance. This is a novel negative finding: nobody in the literature has tried this specific approach.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">D86</a> TL_8 P_{0,0} is completely semisimple: no Jordan blocks at lambda=0 on the dim-42 projective cover. The non-semisimple structure enabling b computation does not persist at this lattice size on P_{0,0} alone. There may be a parity/periodicity pattern in which sizes carry non-semisimple structure at the projective cover level.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Connections to other lenses:</strong> <ul> <li>To Coding Theory: the radical is what the bracket evaluation quotients out. The semisimple quotient TL/rad is the "visible" part; the radical is the "invisible" lattice dimension. This is exactly the information-theoretic partition into accessible and inaccessible bits.</li> <li>To Quantum Mechanics: the radical corresponds to decoherence. The decoherence rate scaling ((2ell-3)/C_ell decreasing with ell) is WHY Fibonacci anyons (ell=5, 17% radical) are better for quantum computing than Ising anyons (ell=4, 36%). The SU(2) quaternionic representation (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>) lives between the abstract TL representation and the scalar bracket trace. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a>'s b = -5/8 connects to LCFT structure constants — the indecomposability parameter is the coupling between the logarithmic partner and the primary field in the c=-2 dense polymer LCFT, and its exact computation from the TL algebra confirms the algebraic origin of LCFT structure constants.</li> <li>To Approximation Theory: the quantum dimensions [n]_q satisfy the Chebyshev recurrence. The Jones-Wenzl idempotents ARE Chebyshev polynomials evaluated on TL generators. The radical appears precisely where the Chebyshev polynomial vanishes. The 13 eigenvector directions of the binary octahedral group provide the DOF count that sets the l=6 bandwidth minimum (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>).</li> </ul>

<h2>Lens 2: Coding Theory</h2>
<p><strong>What the research looks like:</strong> The bracket catalog is a codebook. Z[zeta_8] is a rank-4 lattice over Z, and each bracket value is a codeword. The question "which Boolean functions can be computed?" becomes "which truth tables are achievable via lattice codewords as neural network weights?" This is Nazer-Gastpar's compute-and-forward applied not to relay channels but to topological invariants.</p>
<p><strong>Central demos:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_29.html">D29</a> (forward DKC -- exact Z[zeta_8] arithmetic, 65K+ XOR triples from lattice), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a> (100M quartet exhaustive search -- the parity wall as a coding-theoretic impossibility), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_63.html">D63</a> (parity ceiling n=5, oriented matroid classification), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_46.html">D46</a> (capacity analysis: ~4.3 bits magnitude + ~1.5 bits phase = ~5.8 bits/symbol), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_47.html">D47</a> (two-channel coding conjecture, topology-frequency correlation reversal), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_12.html">D12</a> (quantization geometry, BitNet parallels), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a> (sign-rank expansion, 1-bit compressed sensing, branching interaction, Atkinson sweet spot), <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a> (Dual-Channel Theorem -- product closure predicts parity capability).</p>
<p><strong>Core results belonging to this lens:</strong> <ul> <li>Axiality theorem: at delta=0, bracket values are Z-axial in Z[zeta_8] -- only one coordinate is nonzero.

The cell (S² eigenvector direction) is a coarsening of the eigenvalue angle (S¹). Seven discrete eigenvalue angles arise from the addition: {0°, 30°, 35.264°, 45°, 60°, 65.905°, 90°}. The three non-canonical angles (30°, 35.264°, 65.905°) arise only through quaternion addition breaking the 24-cell group structure — they are not present in individual catalog elements.

This product activation is structurally a Hopf fibration: the eigenvalue S¹ fiber and the eigenvector S² base decompose the unit quaternion as S³ → S². Neither channel alone can compute XOR8 (S² gives 0 winners, S¹ alone gives 0 winners), but the S¹ × S² product gives 6 winners at 100% accuracy. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_74.html">Demo 74</a>'s incomparability of bracket and cell channels is computationally load-bearing: incomparable invariants encode independent computational information.</li> </ul>

Jones normalization is a TQFT gauge choice — fixing the framing anomaly. The anomaly term contributes 2 XOR levels.

The Jordan-cell structure of the Virasoro zero-mode L₀ in LCFT is mirrored by the bracket TL algebra acting on the ζ₈ catalog: null states (bracket-null entries) and logarithmic partners (non-null entries on the same S² direction) form 2×2 Jordan blocks. The 3 shared coordinate-axis directions correspond to null-partner pairs; the 6 null-only directions (cube-edge-midpoints) correspond to unpaired nulls whose logarithmic partners are absent from the catalog. Removing unpartnered null states collapses XOR capacity. The dense polymer model at β=0 (LCFT context) is the physical system where this Jordan-cell structure is natural — and δ=0 in the Kauffman bracket corresponds to exactly this β=0 polymer limit. Non-diagonalizability of L₀ is the algebraic signature of the non-semisimplicity that makes ζ₈ computationally exceptional.</li> </ul>

From the LCFT perspective, this is a regularity condition on the lattice realization of the continuum LCFT — only at TL_4 does the finite-lattice algebra perfectly mirror the continuum Jordan-cell structure.

This is a regime transition from ζ₈ where removing nulls destroys capacity. The LCFT null-state interpretation (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>: null entries as Jordan-cell anchors critical for computation) is regime-dependent: it applies at finite groups (ζ₈, sparse directions, 37.5% null fraction) but not at infinite groups (ζ₁₂, dense directions, 3.0% null fraction). The null fraction dilution series — ζ₄: 75%, ζ₈: 37.5%, ζ₁₂: 3.0% — suggests nulls approach measure zero in the infinite-group limit. In the LCFT language, the Jordan-cell mechanism is a finite-group (non-semisimple, lattice-point) phenomenon; infinite groups have enough non-null directional diversity that the Jordan-cell contribution becomes redundant.</li> </ul>

<p><strong>Connections to other lenses:</strong> <ul> <li>To Representation Theory: the R-matrix lives in the TL algebra. The quantum trace is computed via Jones-Wenzl projectors. Schur-Weyl duality decomposes tensor products into TL standard modules. The quantum trace formula unifies separate module traces (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_06.html">D06</a>) into a single computation (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_04.html">D04</a>). The SU(2) quaternionic representation (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>) lifts the scalar trace to a full geometric object: the 24-cell.</li> <li>To Coding Theory: the bracket amplitude at a root of unity IS a lattice point in Z[zeta_{2ell}]. The quantum amplitude is literally an algebraic integer. This is what makes forward DKC possible: quantum mechanics provides exact integer codewords. The Clifford hierarchy interpretation (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_64.html">D64</a>) gives the T-gate ring its precise physical meaning.</li> <li>To Approximation Theory: the delta error landscape |delta| = 2|cos(2theta)| is a Chebyshev polynomial evaluated at the angle. Gate viability is determined by approximation quality: how close is the evaluation point to a root of the Chebyshev polynomial?

<h2>Lens 4: Approximation Theory</h2>
<p><strong>What the research looks like:</strong> The quantum dimensions [n]_q satisfy the Chebyshev recurrence [n+1]_q = [2]_q * [n]_q - [n-1]_q. The Jones-Wenzl idempotents are Chebyshev polynomials in the TL generators. The semicircle law governs eigenvalue distributions. The 11/13 theorem is a polynomial approximation barrier. The axiality theorem is about angular concentration of Fourier coefficients.</p>

<p><strong>Core results belonging to this lens:</strong> <ul> <li>Quantum dimension recurrence: [n+1]_q = [2]_q * [n]_q - [n-1]_q. This IS the Chebyshev recurrence. At roots of unity, [n]_q vanishes and the Jones-Wenzl projector becomes singular -- this is where non-semisimplicity appears.</li> <li>Zero structure of torus knots: zero counts take values from {0, 4, 8} only. All zeros lie on the pi/8 lattice. The zero count pattern {8,0,0,8,4,4} for T(2,n), n=3,5,7,9,11,13 is cyclic, not monotonic.</li> <li>0x1B unreachability proof: algebraic contradiction via interval squeeze. Three angles phi_1, phi_2, phi_3 cannot simultaneously satisfy the semicircle constraints imposed by the 0x1B truth table. The proof forces phi_3 &gt; pi and phi_3 &lt; pi.</li> <li>0x06 unreachability proof: four-semicircle parallelogram argument. If alpha + beta &gt; pi, all gaps are &lt; pi, making the required intersection empty.</li> <li>Incommensurability hypothesis (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>): parity solution count anti-correlates with gcd(k,8). Sector boundaries misaligned with the pi/4 angular lattice break the symmetry blocking parity. k=6 (gcd=2) gives 906 solutions; k=8 (gcd=8) gives only 96.</li> <li>DKC-RT truncation connection (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_63.html">D63</a>): DKC works because it uses pre-closure bracket information that RT truncation would discard. At delta=0 (ell=2), the most degenerate topological point gives the most structured algebraic point.</li> <li>Generalized activations break the wall (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a>): arbitrary binary sector labelings (not just standard odd/even) remove the absolute wall at k&lt;=23 and achieve XOR6 at k=24. This reveals a two-layer structure: the standard activation wall (k=15) is a labeling convention barrier, the generalized wall (k=24) is the true geometric obstruction. Standard and generalized walls are distinct objects.</li> <li>Two-layer wall decomposition (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a>): Layer 1 (k=6 to k=15): standard odd/even labeling wall. Layer 2 (k=24): generalized minimum where any binary partition can first succeed. Below k=24, no binary coloring of k sectors can separate XOR6 regardless of which sectors are called 0 or 1.</li> <li>Zero margin universality (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a>): all passing XOR6 tuples at all tested k values have exactly zero margin to the nearest sector boundary. Z[zeta_8] lattice sums land exactly on lattice directions (multiples of pi/4), aligning with sector boundaries only for compatible k values. Solutions are algebraically exact, not floating-point approximate.</li> <li>Voronoi activation on S³ (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>): lifting from S¹ to S³ (quaternionic weights) with a 24-cell Voronoi partition (25 cells: 24 vertices + zero cell) achieves 35 XOR6 solutions — more than the 64-cell geographic grid's 34. Data-intrinsic geometry beats geographic grids.</li> <li>S² as optimal activation space (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>): projecting quaternion weights to their eigenvector direction on S² and using a 13-direction Voronoi achieves 36 solutions at only 14 cells (2.57 sol/cell). This beats S¹ (25 cells) and S³ (25 cells). The Hopf S¹ fiber is completely inert: phase-only activation gives zero solutions at all resolutions. The computation lives entirely on the S² Hopf base.</li> <li>Platonic solids fail (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_70.html">D70</a>): octahedral, icosahedral, cuboctahedral, dodecahedral Voronoi partitions all yield zero XOR6 solutions. Data-intrinsic geometry (13 eigenvector directions of the binary octahedral group) is required; standard symmetric polytopal geometry is insufficient.</li> <li>Perceptron formulation (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_68.html">D68</a>): the DKC architecture can be written as 6 bits → 2 neurons (linear combination of stereographic weight projections) → S² Voronoi activation → 1 bit. The 6×2 weight matrix comes from knot theory, not gradient descent. The computation is intrinsically curved: Euclidean nearest-neighbor in R² gives zero solutions; S² great-circle metric gives 36.</li> <li>The 13=13 theorem (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>): the minimum bandwidth for XOR6 DKC on S² is l=6 because mode l has (2l+1) independent spherical harmonic components and 2×6+1=13 equals the number of eigenvector directions. At l=5 there are 11 components (underdetermined); at l=6 there are exactly 13 (determined). The phase transition is sharp: 0% recovery at l&lt;=5, 100% at l=6.</li> <li>Spectral universality (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>): all 36 XOR6 winning triples share the same spectral envelope — l=6 dominant (~80% power), l=4 secondary (~6%), l=12 tertiary (~6-7%). The spectrum is a structural invariant of XOR6 DKC solutions, not solution-specific noise.</li> <li>Super-Nyquist compression (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>): 14 Voronoi cells achieve what Nyquist predicts requires (l+1)²=49 cells — a 3.5× compression. Explained by compressed sensing: XOR6 is a binary function at 13 known support positions, so sparsity plus known support eliminates the generic sampling requirement.</li> </ul>

The algebraic placement is sharp to approximately 5° — consistent with the typical angular Voronoi cell radius for 13 points on S². This is perturbation approximation: the DKC computation is locally stable but not globally continuous.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_73.html">D73</a> automaton determinism as approximation quality metric (82.8%): the fraction of deterministic cell transitions in the additive DKC trajectory is a well-defined approximation-theoretic quantity measuring how well the Voronoi partition approximates the computation as a Markov process. 82.8% universal determinism (48/58 transitions) is a structural constant. The 17% non-determinism comes from discarded magnitude information — the cell captures direction (compass) but not magnitude (odometer). A 27-state signed partition raises this to 87.1% but still not 100%, because 100% requires also tracking the magnitude modulo the weight lattice.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a> algebraic coherence vs vocabulary (approximation theory of discrete group actions): strided selection of 564 catalog entries (maximum spatial coverage: 512 dirs, 43 angles) cannot reach XOR12; deep selection of 564 entries (476 dirs, 19 angles) can. Algebraic coherence — the shared intermediate factor structure of depth-8 entries as products of 8 generators — dominates over angular coverage. This is an approximation-theoretic result about discrete group actions: for computing parity via Voronoi activation, the approximation quality is determined not by how well the weight directions sample S² uniformly but by whether the weights encode complementary algebraic structure from deep composition. The direction explosion / angle refinement phase transition at depth 6–7 is a clean approximation-theoretic boundary.</li> </ul>

Null-only entries have half-angle exactly 90° — a single point on S¹, carrying zero S¹ information. All of their computational contribution (XOR6 capacity, flat across k_sec) comes from S² directional diversity alone. Non-null entries carry both S¹ and S² content. The null/non-null partition is thus a clean anatomical decomposition into pure-S² and mixed-S¹×S² components. At k_sec=1 (direction-only scoring), null-only outperforms non-null-only (9 dirs vs 7 dirs), despite null-only having zero S¹ content — a direct experimental demonstration that S² approximation capacity is independent of S¹ approximation capacity.</li> </ul>

Constrained optimization (nulls free, non-nulls clamped to 2°) achieves 48% design improvement with only 2.8% XOR loss — capturing 92% of unconstrained improvement at less than half the computational cost.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">D88</a> k-ladder resilience: the Sec*Vor k-ladder activation provides 14x better perturbation resilience than <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a>'s Voronoi-only activation under the same design-improving gradient (6.4% loss vs 89% loss).

Computational power grows monotonically while positional information content degrades monotonically — ruling out ALL positional/bandwidth-based explanations for the depth law.

The spectral inversion is the cleanest evidence: positions become less informative while computation improves.</li> <li><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">D91</a> resolution invariance: the combined_cell activation is NOT the bottleneck. Max XOR arity is invariant across all k_sec values (2-48) and all Voronoi direction counts (2-114). Even 4 total cells (k=2 with 2 dirs) can compute XOR8. Finer resolution reveals MORE solutions (586 at k=2 to 7652 at k=48) but never enables HIGHER parity.

<p><strong>Connections to other lenses:</strong> <ul> <li>To Representation Theory: the Chebyshev recurrence IS the quantum dimension recurrence. When [ell]_q = 0, the Jones-Wenzl idempotent p_ell is singular and the algebra becomes non-semisimple. Approximation theory predicts EXACTLY where the algebra changes character. The 13 eigenvector directions are a representation-theoretic count (binary octahedral group mod ±1 = 24 quaternions → 13 directions), and the 13=13 theorem makes this count analytically consequential.</li> <li>To Coding Theory: the 11/13 theorem is a covering problem. The 2 unreachable NPN classes are truth tables that fall outside the covering radius of any angular constellation under half-plane quantization. The proofs use semicircle geometry, which is approximation theory. The two-layer wall structure (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a>) refines the coding picture: the standard layer is a labeling convention, the generalized layer is a genuine lattice coverage impossibility.</li> <li>To Quantum Mechanics: the delta error landscape |delta| = 2|cos(2theta)| is a Chebyshev polynomial. Gate viability (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_20.html">D20</a>) is controlled by how close the evaluation angle is to a Chebyshev root. The "magic angle" 5pi/4 is magic precisely because it is a root.

<h2>The Unified View</h2>
<p>The deepest results sit at the intersection of all four lenses:</p>
<p><strong>The parity wall</strong> is simultaneously: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory) a consequence of non-semisimplicity -- bracket evaluation factors through TL/rad, killing radical degrees of freedom</li> <li>(Coding Theory) a lattice covering impossibility -- no four Z[zeta_8] codewords under split-sigmoid can produce the parity truth table</li> <li>(Quantum Mechanics) a decoherence effect -- the radical is "invisible" under standard bracket evaluation, just as decoherent states are invisible to quantum measurement</li> <li>(Approx Theory) an angular separation barrier -- k=2 sectors cannot place 3 weights in distinct odd sectors (the triskelion requires k=6)</li> </ul>
<p><strong>The axiality theorem</strong> is simultaneously: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory) a rank collapse: semisimple quotient at delta=0 is so constrained that bracket values use only 1 of 4 cyclotomic coordinates</li> <li>(Coding Theory) extreme constellation collapse: a rank-4 lattice degenerates to rank 1</li> <li>(Quantum Mechanics) single-loop selection: delta=0 kills all multi-loop states, and surviving states have phases related by A^4 = -1</li> <li>(Approx Theory) angular concentration: all bracket values at delta=0 point in one of 8 directions (multiples of pi/4)</li> </ul>
<p><strong>The forward DKC construction</strong> assembles all four: <ul> <li>Abramsky (Rep Theory): TL diagrams encode computation</li> <li>Habiro (Quantum Mechanics): bracket values are cyclotomic integers</li> <li>Aizenberg (Approx Theory): k-sector activation reads angular structure</li> <li>Nazer-Gastpar (Coding Theory): algebraic integer lattices support exact computation</li> </ul>
<p>These are not analogies. They are the same mathematics described in four languages.</p>
<p><strong>The S² computation result (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_66.html">D66</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>)</strong> is a fifth unification: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): the binary octahedral group (image of braid group under SU(2)) has exactly 13 eigenvector directions; the direction count is the representation-theoretic fact underlying everything below</li> <li>(QM / TQFT): under the Hopf fibration S³ → S², the S¹ fiber is computationally inert; all information lives in the Hopf base S², which is the Bloch sphere of the SU(2) representation</li> <li>(Coding Theory): the 24 quaternions of the binary octahedral group carry 100 distinct bracket values; bracket and quaternion are complementary hash functions (12.86% collision agreement, 80% mutual divergence)</li> <li>(Approx Theory): the minimum S² bandwidth for XOR6 is l=6, determined by the counting identity 2×6+1=13; compressed sensing explains the 3.5× sub-Nyquist efficiency of the 14-cell Voronoi</li> </ul>
<p><strong>The parity wall</strong> is simultaneously: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): the 13 eigenvector directions = 2l+1 at l=6 is the DOF boundary; n=5 is the last input count for which the Z[zeta_8] bracket solutions have enough directions to span the required computation</li> <li>(Coding Theory): the vocabulary stratification (44 good / 31 poison) is the lattice-theoretic shadow of a matroid minor obstruction</li> <li>(QM): the Clifford hierarchy level (T-gate = level 3, ring = Z[zeta_8]) determines the angle structure; self-doubling = T→S descent = wall mechanism</li> <li>(Approx Theory): the two-layer wall (standard at k=15, generalized at k=24) separates labeling convention from genuine geometric obstruction</li> </ul>
<p><strong>The finite-vs-infinite group boundary (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_82.html">D82</a>)</strong> is a sixth unification: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): ζ₄ → Binary Dihedral (D-series, ADE), ζ₈ → Binary Octahedral (E₇, ADE). Finite groups close at fixed catalog sizes; the ADE classification of finite SU(2) subgroups exactly characterizes the tractable DKC regime. Non-exceptional roots generate infinite (dense) SU(2) subgroups.</li> <li>(QM): the finite cases are the singular (lattice) points of quantum group parameter space where [2]_q ∈ {0, ±2}. The quantum dimension vanishing at ζ₈ ([2]_q = 0) is the most degenerate case — simultaneously the DKC sweet spot and the TL non-semisimplicity maximum.</li> <li>(Coding Theory): finite groups impose hard XOR capacity ceilings (ζ₈ caps at XOR8); infinite groups give logarithmic scaling (ζ₁₂: max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog_size) + 4.6). The coding capacity is determined by group finiteness, not by the ring's algebraic degree or cyclotomic index.</li> <li>(Approx Theory): the linear depth law (max_xor ≈ depth + 6) expresses the approximation cost of DKC in terms of knot-crossing complexity. Algebraic coherence (shared deep intermediate products) dominates over angular vocabulary (coverage of S²). The Kuperberg #P-hardness of generating deep entries at non-lattice roots is the approximation-theoretic price of unbounded capacity.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Framing and null states as resource anatomy (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>)</strong> is a seventh unification: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): Jones normalization removes a writhe-graded module structure (the abelianization of the braid group acting by a 1-dimensional character). The 2-level capacity loss is the dimension of the discarded grading. Null states are radical-module elements whose bracket trace vanishes — precisely the objects whose Jordan-cell structure (non-semisimplicity) makes the ζ₈ algebra computationally exceptional. Semisimple ζ₄ has 75% null fraction but only XOR6 capacity; non-semisimple ζ₈ has 37.5% null fraction and XOR8 capacity. Non-semisimplicity IS the computational resource.</li> <li>(QM / TQFT): the writhe-phase factor is a TQFT framing anomaly; removing it (Jones normalization) is a gauge-fixing operation, and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> measures the information cost of that gauge choice in XOR units. Null states have the LCFT interpretation: Re(q)=0 entries are analogs of null states in LCFT (zero two-point function, nonzero vectors), paired with logarithmic partners via Jordan-cell L₀ action. The dense polymer model at β=0 (δ=0 Kauffman bracket) is where Jordan-cell structure is physically natural. Non-diagonalizability of L₀ = non-semisimplicity of TL = computational exceptionality of ζ₈.</li> <li>(Coding Theory): the resource decomposition is an additive capacity formula: lattice (XOR6) + depth (+2 per unit) + writhe (+2 framing) = total. These are independent coding channels — confirmed by depth-writhe correlation r=0.14. Null entries condition the effective rank of the directional codebook: removing 9 null entries collapses the direction vocabulary from 13 to 7, performing worse than removing a random 9-entry subset. Null states maximize effective rank by exclusively populating 6 cube-edge-midpoint directions unreachable by non-null entries.</li> <li>(Approx Theory): writhe and depth are nearly orthogonal approximation dimensions (r=0.14), contributing independently to the approximation capacity of the weight set. The null/non-null partition cleanly decomposes the S¹ × S² activation space: null entries are pure S² (zero S¹ content, half-angle exactly 90°), non-null entries are mixed S¹ × S². At k_sec=1 (direction-only scoring), null-only outperforms non-null-only — demonstrating that S² and S¹ approximation capacity are independent components.</li> <li>(Reservoir Computing — Pillar 5): writhe and depth as independent computational axes directly parallels RC memory depth (depth) and nonlinearity degree (writhe). Null states maintain the separation property of the RC manifold: they hold the reservoir state space open in directions that active (non-null) states do not cover. Removing null reservoir states collapses the manifold in those directions, destroying the linear separability of higher-order parity functions — exactly the mechanism observed in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_84.html">D84</a>. The "+2 per resource unit" pattern (depth and writhe each add +2) matches the independent-channel additivity expected from reservoir theory when channels are orthogonal.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>The depth law mechanism (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_89.html">D89</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">D91</a>)</strong> is an eighth unification: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): the BFS closure is a walk on the Cayley graph of the SU(2) subgroup. Cross-depth algebraic constraints (gen x deep = only 73 distinct sum angles from 50K pairs vs 1313 for deep x deep) reflect algebraic relationships imposed by the group multiplication table. The axis cancellation mechanism — anti-aligned rotation axes producing low sum angles — is the geometric realization of how the binary octahedral group's conjugacy classes interact under addition.</li> <li>(QM / TQFT): the spectral inversion (S² bandwidth decreasing with depth while computational power increases) rules out all state-space positional explanations. The computation is relational: what matters is how quantum amplitudes interfere (axis cancellation = partial destructive interference of rotation axes), not where individual states sit on the Bloch sphere. This parallels the TQFT principle that topological invariants encode global rather than local information.</li> <li>(Coding Theory): the balanced exponentials principle (vocabulary ~2x/round vs parity demand 4x/weight = slope 1) is a capacity argument in the Shannon tradition — linear scaling emerges from the ratio of two exponential processes. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">D91</a>'s resolution invariance confirms the wall is parity (the coding constraint), not activation (the decoding scheme). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>'s parity-lock theorem shows the ±q encoding's 3^k equivalence classes are the coding-theoretic reason the depth law is parity-specific.</li> <li>(Approx Theory): <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">D91</a> demonstrates that activation resolution (angular sectors, Voronoi directions) controls the number of solutions but not their existence — max_xor is invariant from k=2 to k=48. The depth gap between XOR levels is a parity constraint, not an approximation barrier. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">D88</a>'s k-ladder provides 14x perturbation resilience over Voronoi-only, with the mechanism being multiple fallback resolutions per geometric perturbation.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Complement-blindness and circuit complexity hierarchy (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>)</strong> is a tenth unification: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): the complement-blindness theorem arises from the quaternionic representation structure — negating all input bits sends the quaternion sum S to -S, and the |qa| normalization in combined_cell identifies S with -S. Phase_cell (no sign flip) restores the full [0,360) sector span and recovers all 13 NPN classes. The binary octahedral group's action on the phase_cell partition determines which functions are achievable at each N.</li> <li>(QM / Circuit Complexity): the AND/XOR ratio explosion (1.01 to infinity across N=3-8) IS Hastad's theorem (1987) made visible in a topological computation model. AND is in AC⁰ (low Fourier degree → simple partition geometry → robust under cell-count limits). MAJ is TC⁰-complete (intermediate degree → cliff at N=8). XOR is parity (full Fourier degree → requires balanced bisection → killed by pigeonhole when 2^N &gt; cells). The Furst-Saxe-Sipser/Hastad/LMN circuit complexity hierarchy manifests as hit-rate divergence in the DKC Voronoi × sector partition.</li> <li>(Coding Theory): the pigeonhole mechanism (84 cells at depth 1, XOR dies when 2^N &gt; 84 at N&gt;=7) is a discrete channel capacity limit. AND survives because it needs only 1 unique cell for the all-1s mask — the extreme case of a low-degree function needing minimal partition complexity. The hierarchy of Boolean function difficulty maps directly to partition-complexity requirements of the discrete codebook.</li> <li>(Approx Theory): depth disproportionately helps parity (AND/XOR ratio converges from 7.27 to 1.08 over d=1 to d=6 at N=6). XOR growth is logarithmic saturation, not exponential. The circuit complexity hierarchy manifests as differential depth sensitivity — a new approximation-theoretic observable connecting the Hastad depth hierarchy to DKC catalog depth.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Solvability bottleneck and five-pillar synthesis (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>)</strong> is an eleventh unification: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): the binary icosahedral group 2I (E₈, order 120) is the unique non-solvable finite SU(2) subgroup. Its 9 conjugacy classes and 31 distinct S² directions provide a richer representation-theoretic structure than z8's (E₇, solvable). The ADE classification's endpoint E₈ IS the solvability boundary — every finite SU(2) subgroup below E₈ in the classification is solvable.</li> <li>(QM / TQC): 2I at the Fibonacci parameter has quantum dimension [2]_q = phi^{-1} ≈ 0.618. The same group that makes Fibonacci anyons universal for quantum computation (Burrello et al. 2010) makes DKC maximally powerful among finite groups. Non-solvability of 2I is what Barrington (1989) identified for classical computation AND what Freedman-Larsen-Wang (2002) used for universal TQC — the same algebraic property is load-bearing in both paradigms.</li> <li>(Coding Theory): the matched-size comparison (24 vs 24 entries, z8 vs random 2I subsets) isolates solvability as a coding-theoretic capacity variable. The advantage accelerates with computational difficulty (1.07x→1.67x across N=3-6) — exactly what Barrington predicts: non-solvable groups are strictly more powerful for branching programs, and the gap grows with program length. The E₈ lattice connection (Liu &amp; Calderbank 2008) identifies the ring of icosians (integer combinations of 2I elements) as E₈ — maximal distinguishability.</li> <li>(Approx Theory): the crossover at N=6 (z12 wins at small N due to angular variety, 2I wins at N=6-7 due to non-solvability) reveals two independent approximation resources: density (angular variety, benefits coarse functions) and solvability structure (benefits fine-grained parity). These contribute differently to approximation capacity and dominate in different regimes.</li> <li>(Reservoir Computing — Pillar 5): the precise mapping is now complete. Fixed catalog = reservoir, Cayley graph = connectivity, signed sum = linear readout, activation = nonlinear output, BFS depth = memory depth. Non-solvable groups are expander graphs (high mixing, good separation) — the reservoir topology property that predicts computational power. The testable RKHS kernel prediction (rank ratio &gt; size ratio) would confirm non-solvability as a reservoir-quality indicator above raw reservoir size.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>The parity-lock theorem (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>)</strong> is a twelfth unification: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): the ±q encoding's sign-flip symmetry (combined_cell(S) = combined_cell(-S)) is a consequence of the quaternionic representation structure — negating a quaternion preserves its rotation axis and angle. The 3^k equivalence classes arise from the additive structure of the SU(2) weight lattice under the paired encoding.</li> <li>(QM): parity is the single Boolean function outside AC^0, the one that requires exponential circuit depth in the classical AND/OR/NOT basis. The DKC construction concentrates all computational power on this specific function — the function that is hardest classically is the one that topological quantum amplitudes naturally compute. The (0,0)=(1,1) collision (masks 0...0 and 1...1 always produce zero sums) is a quantum-mechanical selection rule: the encoding preserves total "charge" (parity) while making individual bit values undetectable.</li> <li>(Coding Theory): the parity-lock is a coding constraint — the equivalence class structure of the ±q codebook admits only parity-constant labelings. AND/OR/MAJ all violate f(0...0) != f(1...1), making them structurally impossible under any activation. The 76 mask collisions (all same-parity, zero cross-parity) confirm the code's parity-preserving structure.</li> <li>(Approx Theory): the sign-flip symmetry collapses 27 equivalence classes to at most 14 distinguishable groups under the combined_cell activation. XOR winners use 11-13 of these groups; non-winners use 6-11. The approximation capacity is concentrated on the parity function by the encoding geometry, not by the activation resolution.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>The Barrington-Radical Principle (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>) and axis-alignment proof (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a>)</strong> is a thirteenth unification: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): the radical of non-semisimple TL modules carries an abelian writhe character B_n -&gt; Z/8Z. By Barrington's theorem, abelian groups cannot compute parity. Therefore the radical is provably useless for XOR. Simultaneously, the Z/4Z axis-alignment theorem proves all braid matrix entries are single-axis in Z[zeta_8] at delta=0, with the constructive phase formula reducing DKC to integer path counting + Z/4Z phase lookup. The nesting parity Z/2Z grading provides the combinatorial structure underlying the bipartiteness that guarantees axis-alignment.</li> <li>(QM): the TL visibility filter (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a>) crystallizes what survives the TL quotient at delta=0: writhe survives (and correlates with computation), topological entropy does not. The axis-alignment proof is a quantum degeneracy consequence -- delta=0 (quantum dimension vanishing) forces bracket amplitudes onto single cyclotomic axes. The phase formula Entry(r,c) = (path count) * zeta_8^{phase} is the simplest characterization of what the bracket computes.</li> <li>(Coding Theory): the Dual-Channel Theorem (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>) establishes that parity capability requires both multiplicative phase coherence (product closure &gt; 0) and additive magnitude diversity (v_2 connectivity &gt; trivial). Poison values fail on BOTH channels simultaneously. This maps onto the T-gate/Hadamard decomposition in quantum circuit synthesis (Amy et al. 2023). The sign-rank expansion (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a>) shows that 1-bit sign quantization is an information EXPANDER, not just a lossy quantizer.</li> <li>(Approx Theory): the Atkinson sweet spot (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a>) identifies the optimal information-per-collision tradeoff in sign-hash quantization. The encoding-dependent dual-channel inversion (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>) shows that the polarity of the multiplicative channel flips between additive and multiplicative encoding, with j=0 liveness at delta!=0 providing such algebraic richness that even the simplest activation (Re&gt;0) suffices.</li> </ul>
<p><strong>The macrame principle and k-regime theory (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>)</strong> is a fourteenth unification: <ul> <li>(Rep Theory): branching interaction (cross-block vs within-block under TL_{n-1} restriction) reverses between n=6 (asymmetric blocks dim 5+4, cross-block wins) and n=8 (symmetric blocks dim 14+14, within-block wins). The crossover is a regime transition in sub-module complexity. The sl_d growth rate thesis is confirmed at a fourth strand count (3-&gt;~2x, 4-&gt;~3.1x, 5-&gt;~4x, 6-&gt;~5x, 8-&gt;~7x).</li> <li>(Coding Theory): <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>'s "XOR dies at N&gt;=7" is REFUTED as a k-regime artifact. The ratio k/2^N is the real control parameter: pigeonhole at k/2^N &lt;&lt; 1 kills XOR; collision avoidance at k/2^N &gt;&gt; 1 restores it. W_{8,0} at k=4096 produces XOR8=22266, beating n=6.</li> <li>(QM): the k-regime theory at n=8 confirms that the information-theoretic structure of sign-hash activation (pigeonhole vs collision-avoidance) is independent of strand count and module choice. The computational physics of DKC scales cleanly with braid group size.</li> <li>(Approx Theory): rank saturation methodology (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>) establishes that single-checkpoint rank measurements are unreliable for infinite braid groups. Sign-rank expansion (from nonlinear sign projection) increases with module dimension, providing richer effective approximation spaces at higher strands.</li> </ul>
