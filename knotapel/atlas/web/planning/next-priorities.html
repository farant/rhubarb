<h2>Tier 1: Do Next</h2>
<h3>~~1.1 Formal proof of the sandwich theorem~~ — PARTIALLY DONE</h3>
The <strong>radical dimension formula</strong> (rad(TL_ℓ) = 2ℓ−3) is now formally proven in <code>proofs/radical-dimension-formula.md</code>. Method: Graham-Lehrer cellular theory, unique degenerate cell module V_{ℓ-2} with corank 1, Chebyshev determinant. Corollary: ℓ²−ℓ−3 at n=ℓ+1.
<strong>Additionally proven:</strong> Markov RT truncation (<code>proofs/markov-rt-truncation.md</code>) and next-level radical formula (<code>proofs/next-level-radical-formula.md</code>). These strengthen Paper 3.
<strong>Remaining:</strong> The full sandwich theorem (rad^2(TL_{2k}(0)) ≅ TL_{2k-1}(0) as algebras) is a stronger claim than the dimension formula. The proof proves dimensions match; the algebra isomorphism still needs formal proof. Also: nilpotency=3 and Fibonacci rank remain computationally verified, not proven.
<strong>Conjecture-graph priority:</strong> Rank 1 (C3). Unlocks C6, C7, C5, C9 downstream.
<h3>~~1.2 4-input parity: test the triskelion generalization~~ — DONE (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_63.html">Demo 63</a>)</h3>
4-input parity reachable at k=8 (96 solutions, tetraskelion). 5-input parity at k=15 (3020 solutions, pentaskelion). <strong>Parity ceiling for Z[zeta_8] is n=5.</strong> Triskelion generalization (k=2n) <strong>FALSIFIED</strong> — n=5 requires k=15, not k=10. True scaling: k=2M-1 where M is ray count. Oriented matroid classification: alternating OM type required for parity. Two types of impossibility: constraint wall (n=6,7) vs pigeonhole (n&gt;=8).
<h3>1.3 Analytical proof of the 13=13 bandwidth bound</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Prove analytically that the minimum bandwidth for a binary Voronoi partition separating N points on S² in general position is l = ⌈(N−1)/2⌉. For XOR6 DKC, N=13 (eigenvector directions) giving l=6. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a> verified this computationally with a sharp phase transition (0% recovery at l≤5, 100% at l=6) and 80.7% average power in mode l=6 across all 36 solutions.
<strong>Why:</strong> The 13=13 theorem is the cleanest standalone publication target in the arc — self-contained, striking, and proven at the computational level already. An analytical proof would make it a rigorous theorem rather than a verified result, and would immediately imply the trivialization prediction for finer roots (ζ_16 → l≥1728) analytically.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL to MEDIUM (key insight is degrees-of-freedom counting; the hard part is formalizing "general position" and proving no sub-Nyquist trick works at l=5).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Strengthens Paper 5 (24-Cell, S², Spectral Geometry). Turns <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_71.html">D71</a>'s computational phase transition into a publishable theorem.
<strong>Conjecture-graph priority:</strong> Rank 4 (C19). Downstream: C20 (trivialization DOF prediction).
<h3>1.4-NEW XOR7 on S² — context updated by <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">D78</a>/<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Test the spectral framework scaling on XOR7. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a> showed XOR7 requires k=127 sectors on S¹. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a> showed XOR6 drops from k=24 (S¹) to 14 cells (S²). If the DOF formula generalizes, XOR7 on S² should need l=⌈(N_7−1)/2⌉ where N_7 is the number of XOR7-relevant eigenvector directions. Measure: does S² reduce XOR7 from k=127 as dramatically as it did XOR6?
<strong>Why:</strong> Directly tests whether the spectral framework is a systematic tool for climbing the parity hierarchy, or whether XOR6 on S² is a special case.
<strong>Context update (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">D78</a>/<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a>):</strong> At ζ₈, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_78.html">D78</a> confirmed XOR10 = 0 (ζ₈ wall is hard). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a> established that ζ₈ generates a finite group (24 elements) and this is the fundamental ceiling. XOR7 on S² is therefore a question about what can be achieved within the finite-group regime.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Determines whether Paper 5 covers a theorem or a single data point.
<h3>1.5 Catalog completeness argument</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Prove or bound that the 100-value Z[zeta_8] catalog at delta=0 contains all distinct bracket values up to braid length L. Alternatively, prove asymptotic saturation (new values per additional crossing approaches zero).
<strong>Why:</strong> Every forward DKC exhaustive search ("0 out of 100M") depends on the catalog being complete enough. Without a completeness argument, a reviewer can ask "what if you missed a value?" This is the single most important gap for Paper 1.
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> context:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> found 186 distinct Z[zeta_8] values from 32768-entry catalog, with 72 new values at depth 8 (still growing). The value set has NOT converged — this makes the completeness argument harder but the characterization more urgent.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (1 demo — extend enumeration to length 10-12, track saturation curve, attempt an algebraic bound using axiality + single-loop selection).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Strengthens Paper 1 from "exhaustive over our catalog" to "exhaustive over all bracket values up to length L."
<h3>1.6 Convexity thesis: complete the formal proof</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Formalize the argument that the 11/13 wall is a consequence of activation convexity (not just encoding geometry). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_57.html">D57</a> and <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_62.html">D62</a> have the ingredients; what's missing is a single clean theorem statement with a self-contained proof.
<strong>Why:</strong> The 11/13 theorem (Paper 2) has clean proofs for the two unreachable classes, but the UNIFYING explanation (convexity) is informal. A formal convexity theorem would elevate Paper 2 from "two separate impossibility results" to "one structural theorem with two corollaries."
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (1 demo — mostly writing, possibly one verification).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Paper 2 becomes a stronger, more unified submission.
<strong>Conjecture-graph priority:</strong> Rank 3 (C14). Downstream: C15 (unified 0x06/0x1B proof).
<h3>1.7 ζ₁₂ Sec×Vor activation for XOR10+ — <strong>HIGH PRIORITY</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_79.html">D79</a> demonstrated that ζ₁₂ breaks the ζ₈ wall for XOR10 (124 winners) and XOR12 (50+ winners) using Sec×Vor activation with the default sector count. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">D77</a> showed that Sec(8)×Vor (112 cells) is far more powerful than Voronoi alone (14 cells) at ζ₈. The combination has not yet been tested at ζ₁₂.
<strong>Why:</strong> This is the direct next step in the scaling arc. HIGH priority: immediate publication impact for Paper 6.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL to MEDIUM (Sec×Vor infrastructure exists from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">D77</a>; port to ζ₁₂ catalog, sweep k, measure capacity per round).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Paper 6 capacity chapter.
<h3>1.8 ζ₃₂ finiteness test</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_80.html">D80</a> proposed the Power-of-Two Finiteness Conjecture: finite groups occur exactly at angles of the form π/2^k (k ≥ 1), predicting ζ₃₂ (θ = π/16) should also be finite. A single test_root(32) call confirms or refutes.
<strong>Why:</strong> Extremely low implementation cost, high payoff either way.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (single test).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Confirms or refutes Power-of-Two Conjecture. Completes the ADE/finiteness survey for Paper 6.
<h3>1.9 Framing test at ζ₁₆/ζ₂₄</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> demonstrated that Jones normalization destroys exactly 2 XOR levels at both ζ₈ and ζ₁₂. Testing at ζ₁₆ and ζ₂₄ would confirm whether the loss is truly universal across all roots.
<strong>Why:</strong> If universal, the Resource Decomposition Conjecture (C26) becomes stronger. Two additional data points close the main reviewer concern.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a> infrastructure auto-adapts).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Universality claim for resource decomposition. Paper 6 framing chapter.
<h3>1.10 Analytical proof of +2 writhe loss</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Prove analytically that the (-A³)^{-w} Jones phase factor costs exactly 2 XOR levels through angular vocabulary reduction. The mechanism is identified (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_83.html">D83</a>); what remains is counting angle-class orbits.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Elevates framing result from empirical to proven. High publication value.
<h3>~~1.11 ζ₁₂ null indispensability~~ — DONE (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">Demo 87</a>)</h3>
<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">D87</a> demonstrated that null indispensability is regime-dependent. At ζ₁₂ (infinite group, 4096 entries), removing all 121 bracket-null entries preserves full XOR6/8/10/12 capacity.
<h3>1.12-NEW 1wpi encoding depth law test — <strong>HIGH PRIORITY (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a> proves the +/-q encoding is parity-locked. The 1wpi encoding (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_48.html">D48</a>/<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_50.html">D50</a>) computes all 13 NPN classes but has never been tested for depth-law behavior. Does max_and or max_maj scale linearly with crossing depth under 1wpi encoding?
<strong>Why:</strong> THE most architecturally consequential open question for the compilation pipeline. The hybrid LLM vision needs AND/OR for syllogistic logic, not just parity. If the depth law holds under 1wpi, the entire scaling framework extends to non-parity functions.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL to MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Determines whether the depth law is parity-specific or encoding-general. Critical for Paper 7 and the hybrid LLM vision.
<h3>1.13-NEW Encoding design for non-parity functions — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> The +/-q encoding is parity-locked; the 1wpi encoding computes all 13 NPN classes. Hybrid and novel encodings targeting specific Boolean functions are unexplored.
<strong>Why:</strong> Encoding determines computability more fundamentally than activation or catalog (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>). For any non-parity function, a different encoding is required.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM (1-2 demos).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Opens the path from parity-only DKC to general Boolean function DKC.
<h3>1.14-NEW Prove balanced exponentials analytically — <strong>HIGH PRIORITY (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">D91</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">D91</a> confirmed the balanced exponentials explanation for the linear depth law: BFS vocabulary grows ~2x/round, parity demand grows 4x/weight, yielding slope ~1. Derive this analytically.
<strong>Why:</strong> Next clean formal proof candidate after the parity-lock theorem. Conjecture-graph Rank 2 (C23). Downstream: C26, C27, C28, C37.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL to MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Elevates the depth law from "demonstrated at ζ₁₂" to a theorem.
<h3>1.15-NEW Regime transition characterization — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">D87</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">D87</a> established the regime transition between ζ₈ (nulls indispensable) and ζ₁₂ (nulls dispensable). The exact threshold is unknown.
<strong>Why:</strong> A sharp threshold theorem gives a concrete design rule: below transition, preserve nulls; above, prune safely.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (port <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_87.html">D87</a> infrastructure to ζ₁₀ and truncated ζ₁₂; sweep; locate crossover).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Completes finite/infinite group regime characterization.
<h3>1.16-NEW Paper 7 potential: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a> mechanistic arc</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> The <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a> arc forms a coherent publication answering "why does DKC work and what are its structural limits?"
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM (writing + 1-2 confirming experiments from 1.12 and 1.14).
<h3>1.17-NEW RKHS kernel rank test (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_95.html">D95</a>) — <strong>HIGHEST PRIORITY (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Compute DKC kernel matrix K(m,m') for 2I (60 entries) vs z8 (24 entries). If rank(K_2I)/rank(K_z8) &gt; 120/24 = 5, non-solvability contributes above raw catalog size — confirming the "discrete algebraic reservoir computer" interpretation.
<strong>Why:</strong> One number validates or falsifies the entire five-pillar synthesis. The five-pillar synthesis is the most important theoretical result since the original DKC discovery.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (single demo).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Validates reservoir computing pillar. Critical for Paper 8.
<h3>1.18-NEW Higher k_sec with 2I — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> At k_sec=24 instead of 12. Does N=8 XOR become nonzero for 2I?
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (parameter sweep in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a> infrastructure).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Tests whether 2I's angular richness is under-exploited at k=12.
<h3>1.19-NEW Depth law under phase_cell — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Does the linear depth law hold under phase_cell activation (which recovers all 13 NPN classes)? Does the slope differ for different Boolean functions?
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL to MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Completes depth law generalization to all functions.
<h3>~~1.20-NEW 6-strand W_{6,4} decisive test~~ — RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>)</h3>
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> tested W_{6,4} head-to-head against W_{6,0}: Barrington-Radical Principle established.</strong> Radical carries abelian writhe character, provably useless for parity. Simple W_{6,0} WINS at every XOR level. The question is now RESOLVED: non-semisimplicity provides only modest (+8%) mixing-row advantage at XOR6, not deep capacity. See Arc 11b (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>) for full results.
<h3>1.21-NEW Ext^1 thesis formalization — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Formalize the Ext^1 catalytic preparation thesis: prove that the Ext^1 class in Ext^1(L(0), L(1)) for u_q(sl_2) at ell=2 is the unique obstruction to Property F, and that Jordan block structure is computationally necessary for XOR levels beyond the combinatorial regime.
<strong>Why:</strong> The Ext^1 thesis is the deepest theoretical finding of the multi-strand arc. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> STRENGTHENS this: the radical itself is inert (abelian writhe), but the quotient structure of non-semisimple modules (the extension, not the radical) is the actual computational resource.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM to LARGE (theoretical work).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Central theoretical contribution of Paper 9.
<h3>1.22-NEW Simple vs non-semisimple computational difference — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a>/<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Systematic characterization of <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a> vs <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a> pattern. W_{6,4} test (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>) resolved the question partially but showed the distinction is more nuanced: it's not about radical content (which is inert) but about quotient structure.
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> update:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> proved radical-as-resource REFUTED. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a> proved BFS is braid-group-invariant. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a>'s simple-module-deeper-capacity-deficiency is confirmed as structural. The systematic framework is now: radical = inert (abelian writhe character), extension = resource (Ext^1 catalytic preparation), simple = broader shallow but shallower deep.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (analysis + comparison table from existing <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> data).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Systematic framework for representation choice. Paper 9.
<h3>1.23-NEW Additive encoding at delta=sqrt(2) — <strong>NEW HIGH PRIORITY (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> showed product closure polarity INVERTS between additive (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>) and multiplicative (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>) encodings. The cleanest confirmation: hold delta=sqrt(2) constant, switch to additive encoding. If <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>-style discrimination (parity = HIGH product closure) returns, encoding-dependence is confirmed by a single controlled experiment.
<strong>Why:</strong> Single controlled experiment confirms the encoding-dependent dual-channel theorem. Low implementation cost (reuse <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> catalog, change encoding). Directly validates the polarity inversion discovered in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>, which is the first result predicting computational capability from algebraic structure.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (reuse <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> infrastructure, change encoding parameter).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Confirms the encoding-dependent dual-channel theorem. Essential for Paper 10 (Raqiya arc). Validates the predictive capability analysis framework.
<h3>1.24-NEW Amy Bridge formalization — <strong>NEW HIGH PRIORITY (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>, conjecture-graph Rank 5)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Map DKC dual-channel (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>) onto T-gate/Hadamard decomposition in Amy-Glaudell-Ross 2023. Product closure → sde (smallest denominator exponent, T-gate count); activation → Hadamard gate. Show the resource theory matches.
<strong>Why:</strong> Would connect DKC to quantum circuit synthesis resource theory — a major publication target. The dual-channel theorem (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>) provides the empirical foundation; <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>'s encoding-dependent polarity inversion constrains the mapping. Conjecture-graph Rank 5 (C51). Downstream: C53 (dual-channel generalization).
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM (requires detailed reading of Amy et al. 2023 + formal mapping).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Places DKC in established quantum circuit synthesis framework. Paper 10.
<h3>1.25-NEW Major index theorem for general W_{n,j} — <strong>NEW (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a>, conjecture-graph Rank 8)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> verified maj mod 2 = bipartite coloring at W_{4,2} (3/3) and W_{6,2} (9/9, uniquely winning among 4 candidates). Proof for general n,j is open. Need verification at W_{8,2}, W_{6,4}, W_{10,2} for more evidence.
<strong>Why:</strong> Novel algebraic invariant of TL link states. Researcher confirmed NOT a consequence of known KLR Z-grading (Plaza-Ryom-Hansen 2013). Low-cost verification at more modules, high publication value for proof. Conjecture-graph Rank 8 (C41).
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (verification at additional modules) to MEDIUM (proof).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Novel algebraic result. Generalizes nesting parity grading.
<h3>1.26-NEW W_{8,2} rank saturation and head-to-head — <strong>NEW (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> showed W_{8,2} rank was severely under-sampled (34.9% at 16384 entries, sign expansion at 1.83x and still climbing). Head-to-head W_{8,0} vs W_{8,2} XOR comparison at matched k and oversampling has NOT been performed. Need ~130K entries for comparable oversampling.
<strong>Why:</strong> Unresolved empirical question from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>. Would settle whether dim-28 algebraic information provides advantage at sufficient activation resolution. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>'s rank saturation confound means all prior cross-module comparisons are unreliable.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM (requires larger BFS cap or smarter sampling).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Resolves the dim-28 vs dim-14 question at sufficient activation resolution.
<h3>1.27-NEW Macrame principle crossover location — <strong>NEW (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a> showed cross-block branching dominates at n=6 (asymmetric blocks dim 5+4). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> showed within-block dominates at n=8 (symmetric blocks dim 14+14). Where is the exact crossover? W_{10,2} could bracket it.
<strong>Why:</strong> Gives a design rule for multi-strand activation: when to use cross-block vs within-block components. The crossover likely depends on block complexity.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Principled activation design rule for multi-strand DKC.

<h2>Tier 2: Do Soon</h2>
<h3>~~2.1 ell=7 verification~~ — DONE (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_60.html">Demo 60</a>)</h3>
All predictions confirmed. Paper 3 strengthened.
<h3>2.2 Axiality: determine if it follows from known Galois theory</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Consult the cyclotomic Galois theory literature to determine whether the axiality theorem at delta=0 is a trivial consequence of Gal(Q(zeta_8)/Q).
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> update:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a>'s Z/4Z Axis-Alignment Theorem STRENGTHENS the axiality question: the constructive nesting-parity phase formula provides a proof at the matrix-entry level (stronger than bracket-level axiality). Researcher confirmed the nesting parity Z/2Z grading is NOT a consequence of known KLR Z-grading. This makes formal upgrade of T1 proof sketch to rigorous proof (C1) more tractable — the proof strategy from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> (bipartiteness + TL generator {0,1} structure) may directly yield the bracket-level proof.
<strong>Conjecture-graph priority:</strong> Rank 7 (C1). Downstream: C2 (axiality hierarchy).
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL (research task).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Determines whether Paper 4 exists as standalone.
<h3>2.3 Sharpen the relationship to Aizenberg 2008</h3>

<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> update:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>'s Dual-Channel Theorem provides the algebraic anatomy of the two channels: multiplicative phase coherence (product closure) corresponds to the phase channel and additive magnitude diversity (v_2 connectivity) corresponds to the magnitude channel. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> refines with encoding-dependence. The information-theoretic quantification remains open but the structural foundation is stronger.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM (1-2 demos).
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Two-channel coding conjecture.
<h3>2.5 Multi-layer DKC</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Cascade two bracket-valued neurons. Can a 2-layer DKC network compute functions that a single layer cannot?
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a> context:</strong> Multi-layer composition is especially important because <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a> shows the +/-q encoding limits single-layer to parity. Multi-layer with 1wpi encoding could be the path to arbitrary Boolean functions with depth-law scaling.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM (2 demos).

<strong>What:</strong> Investigate whether 19 is special with respect to the Z[zeta_8] lattice.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL.
<h3>2.10 Direct deep-entry generation — still open</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Can depth-d entries be characterized and generated directly without computing all shallower depths?
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_89.html">D89</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">D90</a> context:</strong> Deep entries are valuable for their pairwise relationships (relational, not positional). This may make direct generation harder.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Reduces computational cost of high-XOR DKC.
<h3>2.11 Optimal depth for target XOR level — still open</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Is pure depth-8 truly optimal, or would a mixed depth strategy achieve XOR12 with fewer entries?

<strong>What:</strong> Does max_xor ≈ depth + 6 hold at ζ₁₀? ζ₁₆? With a different constant?
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_89.html">D89</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_91.html">D91</a> context:</strong> The balanced exponentials argument predicts slope should vary with BFS branching factor.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL to MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Universality vs. root-dependence of the depth law. Critical for Paper 6.

<strong>What:</strong> Can <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_77.html">D77</a>'s empirical result be proven formally, accounting for <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_92.html">D92</a>'s encoding hierarchy?
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a> update:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a> proves BFS growth is module-independent (activation geometry matters, not dimension). <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_104.html">D104</a> identifies Atkinson sweet spot. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>'s k-regime theory (k/2^N ratio controls capacity) provides the parametric foundation for formalizing what "activation determines capacity" means.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Paper 6's theoretical core.
<h3>2.15 Explicit Jordan-cell pairs — still open, updated by <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">D86</a></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Do the 3 shared-direction null/non-null pairs at ζ₈ form literal Jordan cells?
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_85.html">D85</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">D86</a> context:</strong> b = -5/8 strengthens LCFT connection; <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">D86</a> shows b is collective.

<h3>2.17 Resource decomposition at intermediate depths — still open</h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Does the +2 bracket-vs-Jones gap hold at every depth level?
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Confirms or refines additive resource decomposition.
<h3>2.18-NEW Spectral inversion formal proof — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_90.html">D90</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Prove BFS closure of finite SU(2) generators converges to uniform distribution on S² (bandwidth → 0) as depth → ∞.
<strong>Why:</strong> Spectral inversion is the cleanest evidence that depth law mechanism is relational, not positional.
<strong>Effort:</strong> SMALL to MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Strengthens relational computation thesis.
<h3>2.19-NEW Robustness engineering: constrained optimization at ζ₁₂ — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_88.html">D88</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> At ζ₁₂ (2043 directions), can constrained optimization identify load-bearing subsets analogous to ζ₈'s body-diagonal anchors?

<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a> showed parity requires product closure &gt; 0. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> showed polarity inverts at delta=sqrt(2). At what product closure density does the additive-to-multiplicative transition occur? Is there a sharp threshold or gradual crossover?
<strong>Why:</strong> Would make the dual-channel theorem quantitatively predictive, not just qualitatively discriminative. Test by interpolating between encoding regimes.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Quantitative dual-channel theorem. Paper 10.
<h3>2.21-NEW TL visibility at delta != 0 — <strong>NEW (from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a>'s TL visibility filter is sharp at delta=0 where e_i^2=0. At delta!=0, e_i^2=delta*e_i != 0, meaning TL quotient is less destructive. Do dynamical properties (entropy, spectral radius) become visible to DKC at delta!=0?
<strong>Why:</strong> If entropy correlates with DKC at delta!=0, the TL visibility filter becomes a delta-dependent design parameter. Would test at delta=sqrt(2) using <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>'s infrastructure.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Delta-dependent visibility theory.

What determines whether sign quantization expands or preserves rank?
<strong>Why:</strong> Would provide foundational principle for multi-strand activation design.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Principled activation engineering for multi-strand DKC.
<h3>2.23-NEW Radical Content XOR Correlation Study — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_100.html">D100</a>)</strong></h3>
<strong>What:</strong> Hub commutators have zero radical content — they annihilate the radical direction. Is this a general theorem for non-semisimple TL modules?
<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> update:</strong> <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>'s Barrington-Radical Principle (radical carries abelian writhe character) provides the theoretical framework: commutators of non-abelian group elements must annihilate the 1D abelian radical component.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Structural theorem for non-semisimple TL modules.
<h3>2.24-NEW Fibonacci Direct Test at q=exp(2pi*i/5) — <strong>(from <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>/<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>)</strong></h3>

<strong><a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a> update:</strong> Barrington-Radical Principle sharpens the mapping: alpha-anyons → extension structure (not radical itself), sigma-anyons → qubits, semisimple readout → Boolean output.
<strong>Effort:</strong> MEDIUM.
<strong>Unblocks:</strong> Connects DKC to cutting edge of non-semisimple TQFT.

<li>~~Can b be extracted from single P_{0,0}?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">D86</a>). No. Universal divergence. Novel negative result.</li>

<ul>
<li>~~AND/OR/MAJ under 1wpi?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>). Yes, via phase_cell.</li>
<li>~~Circuit complexity hierarchy?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_93.html">D93</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>). AND graceful, MAJ cliff, XOR pigeonhole. Universal across groups.</li>
<li>~~E₈ (2I) reachable?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>). Yes, via Z[sqrt5] generators.</li>
<li>~~Non-solvability predicts capacity (Barrington)?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_94.html">D94</a>). Yes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>~~Trace readout sufficient for multi-strand?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">D98</a>). No. Catastrophically lossy (5.1%). Column/block readout needed.</li>
<li>~~Does non-semisimplicity provide computational advantage?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_99.html">D99</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a>). Yes. W_{4,2} (non-semisimple) XOR14=70, W_{5,3} (simple) XOR14=0.</li>
<li>~~sl_d growth rate confirmed?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_98.html">D98</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_101.html">D101</a>). Yes, ~(n-1)x at 3 data points.</li>

<ul>
<li>~~6-strand W_{6,4} decisive test (radical as resource)?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_102.html">D102</a>). Radical carries abelian writhe character, provably useless for parity. Simple W_{6,0} wins at every XOR level. Barrington-Radical Principle named.</li>
<li>~~Does higher module dimension help?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_103.html">D103</a>). No. BFS growth is braid group invariant. Higher dimension HURTS XOR via curse of dimensionality in sign-hash.</li>
<li>~~"XOR dies at N&gt;=7"?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_105.html">D105</a>). REFUTED as k-regime artifact. W_{8,0} XOR8=22266 at k=4096. k/2^N ratio is the control parameter.</li>
<li>~~Does topological entropy predict DKC capability?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_106.html">D106</a>). No. Completely orthogonal. TL visibility filter explains why.</li>
<li>~~Is axis-alignment of braid matrices provable?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a>). YES — Z/4Z Axis-Alignment Theorem PROVEN with constructive nesting-parity phase formula.</li>
<li>~~Can algebraic structure predict parity capability?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>). YES — Dual-Channel Theorem: product closure + v_2 connectivity discriminate parity/poison.</li>
<li>~~Is the dual-channel theorem encoding-independent?~~: RESOLVED (<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>). NO — product closure polarity INVERTS between additive and multiplicative encodings. Encoding-Dependent Dual-Channel Theorem established.</li>
