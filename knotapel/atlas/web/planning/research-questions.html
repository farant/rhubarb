<p><strong>Q2.12. Single P_{0,0} divergence structural reason.</strong> The delta-parameterized Gram matrix universally diverges on a single projective cover at every eigenvalue and every lattice size.

<p><strong>Q2.13. TL_8 P_{0,0} semisimplicity.</strong> Why is TL_8 P_{0,0} completely semisimple (no Jordan blocks at lambda=0) when TL_4 and TL_6 have Jordan blocks? Is there a periodicity or parity pattern in the non-semisimple structure of projective covers across lattice sizes? <ul> <li>Source: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_86.html">D86</a> | Difficulty: MODERATE | Publication: structural theorem about TL non-semisimplicity</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Q2.14. Spin chain b at larger sizes.</strong> Does the spin chain approach on (C^2)^{tensor n} at q=i give b = -2 at n=6,8?

<h2>3. Coding Theory</h2>
<p><strong>Q3.1. Two-channel coding conjecture.</strong> Magnitude (~4.3 bits) + phase (~1.5 bits). Joint decoder achieves ~5.8 bits/symbol? <strong>RELATED: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>'s Dual-Channel Theorem provides the algebraic anatomy of these two channels</strong>: multiplicative phase coherence (product closure) corresponds to the phase channel and additive magnitude diversity (v_2 connectivity) corresponds to the magnitude channel. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> refines this with encoding-dependence: under multiplicative encoding the product closure polarity inverts. The information-theoretic quantification remains open. <ul> <li>Source: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_46.html">D46</a>-<a href="../inventory/entries/demo_47.html">47</a>, four-lenses, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_108.html">D108</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> | Difficulty: HARD | Publication: standalone info-theory contribution</li> </ul>

<p><strong>Q4.3. Is axiality at delta=0 known?</strong> 131K braids verified. Must check if trivially follows from cyclotomic theory. <strong>SUBSTANTIALLY ADDRESSED by <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a></strong>: The Z/4Z Axis-Alignment Theorem provides a constructive proof that every braid matrix entry over a TL module at delta=0 is axis-aligned, with a phase formula Entry(r,c) = (path count) <em> zeta_8^{(w - 2</em>(nest(r) + nest(c))) mod 4}. This is stronger than the bracket-level axiality. Researcher confirmed the nesting parity Z/2Z grading is NOT a consequence of known KLR Z-grading (Plaza-Ryom-Hansen 2013), so the result appears genuinely novel. <em>Formal upgrade of the bracket-level proof sketch (T1) to rigorous proof (C1) remains open.</em> <ul> <li>Source: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_35.html">D35</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> | Difficulty: APPROACHABLE (expert consultation) | Publication: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_107.html">D107</a> strengthens significance substantially</li> </ul>

<p><strong>Q6.7. Solution count monotonicity at k=15.</strong> Solutions decrease 23004-&gt;16108-&gt;3020-&gt;0 as n increases from 3 to 6.

<p><strong>Q6.8. Clifford hierarchy universality.</strong> ~~Does the parity ceiling n=5 climb the Clifford hierarchy one rung per additional input?~~ <strong>ANSWERED/REFUTED by <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_65.html">D65</a></strong>: ceiling is algebra-independent -- it does NOT climb. n=5 is unchanged at Z[zeta_16].

The conjecture is that XOR_n on the 24-cell always yields n<em>(n-1)/2 orbits (6=5</em>4/2... wait, 6=C(4,2)).

Why?~~ <strong>ADDRESSED by <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a></strong>: angle subsumes cell for sums -- angle channel perfectly predicts parity for all 36 winning triples, and the cell is a coarsening of the angle channel. The S^2 Voronoi cell carries no information beyond what the angle (S^1 component) encodes at the computation level. Full proof from antipodal symmetry / even spherical harmonics argument still needed. <ul> <li>Source: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_67.html">D67</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_75.html">D75</a> | Difficulty: MODERATE | Publication: theoretical heart of the S^2 arc</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Q6.11. 13=13 theorem analytical proof.</strong> Computationally: minimum bandwidth for XOR6 on S^2 is l=6 because 2x6+1=13=number of eigenvector directions (sharp phase transition: 0% recovery at l&lt;=5, 100% at l=6). Can this be proven analytically?

<p><strong>Q6.12. Trivialization threshold.</strong> XOR6 transitions from topology-driven (~36 solutions at 14 cells) to pigeonhole-dominated (~90% at 3,458 cells for zeta_16). The exact threshold lies between ~50 and ~500 Voronoi cells but has not been pinned down. <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_72.html">D72</a> provides an additional data point: t=0 anti-correlation shows the algebraically-selected 13-cell configuration is locally maximal for XOR6 (36 solutions vs 4 for a geometrically optimized design).

<p><strong>Q17.13. Raqiya Z[zeta_16] extension.</strong> Is it worth building full Raqiya support for Z[zeta_16] (currently handled by ad-hoc ZiAxis type in <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>) if more delta!=0 analysis is needed? The Scrutinium generic framework could absorb Z[zeta_16] as a new genus. <ul> <li>Source: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a> | Difficulty: APPROACHABLE | Publication: tooling decision</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Q17.14. j=0 liveness implies structural universality.</strong> At delta=0, j=0 dead implies impoverished algebra implies structural asymmetry detectable by Raqiya. At delta!=0, j=0 alive implies rich algebra implies structural universality (7/8 symmetry). Does this hold at other delta values (delta=1, delta=2)? Would generalize the <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_52.html">D52</a> j=0 liveness observation into a structural dichotomy theorem. <ul> <li>Source: <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_109.html">D109</a>, <a href="../inventory/entries/demo_52.html">D52</a> | Difficulty: MODERATE | Publication: structural dichotomy linking j=0 to algebraic richness</li> </ul>
