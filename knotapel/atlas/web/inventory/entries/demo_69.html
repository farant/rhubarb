<h3>Headline</h3>
Comparing SU(2) eigenvector geometry across ζ<em>8, ζ_16, and ζ_32 proves a universal Direction Nesting Theorem (ζ_N ⊂ ζ</em>{2N} exactly on S²) and reveals that ζ_8 is the computational sweet spot: the coarsest root that produces structured directions, preserved exactly at every finer root, while finer roots trivialize XOR6 through pigeonhole saturation.
<h3>Key Results</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ζ_8 → ζ_16 RIGIDITY (13/13, 0.000°)</strong>: All 13 of ζ_8's eigenvector directions appear identically in ζ_16 to machine precision. Zero angular drift. The match is not approximate — algebraically forced by ζ_8 = (ζ_16)², so every ζ_8 braid word is a valid doubled word in ζ_16, and squaring a quaternion preserves its rotation axis.</li>
<li><strong>ζ_8 → ζ_32 partial nesting (8/13, 2.07° max drift)</strong>: Cap artifact limits enumeration. Monotonic recovery (6/13 at smaller cap → 8/13 at larger cap) with shrinking drift strongly supports full 13/13 nesting at sufficient depth. Algebraic argument (ζ_8 = (ζ_32)⁴) is watertight.</li>
<li><strong>Catalog explosion</strong>: ζ_8: 24 quaternions, 13 directions; ζ_16: 7,952 quaternions, 3,457 directions; ζ_32: 32,768+ quaternions, 4,096+ directions (still cap-limited). Direction-to-quaternion ratio drops from 0.54 to 0.43 to 0.13 as caps interfere.</li>
<li><strong>XOR6 trivialization</strong>: ζ_8 Voronoi (14 cells): 36 solutions, 0.007% of all triples. ζ_16 Voronoi (3,458 cells): 499,367 solutions, 90.6%. ζ_32 Voronoi (4,097 cells): 493,654 solutions, 89.6%. With 3,457+ cells the pigeonhole effect means 64 binary inputs spread over thousands of cells — almost any weight placement avoids collision.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed-resolution comparison</strong>: At 16 cells, ζ_16 (450 solutions) &gt; ζ_32 (393 solutions). Finer roots are not monotonically better at fixed resolution; which directions land in which cells matters more than raw direction count.</li>
<li><strong>ζ_8 is the computational sweet spot</strong>: Coarsest root that generates the 13-direction structure on S². Finer roots nest it exactly but add no computational power at fixed partition size — and at their natural Voronoi resolution they trivialize the computation entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Musical temperament analogy</strong>: ζ_8 = 13-note equal temperament (each solution meaningful); ζ_16 = 3,457 microtones (consonance trivially achieved); ζ_32 = effectively continuous (every triple sounds good).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Theorems/Conjectures</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theorem (Direction Nesting)</strong>: For any N, all eigenvector directions in the ζ<em>N catalog appear in the ζ</em>{2N} catalog. The nesting is exact on S². Algebraic proof: σ<em>i(2θ) = σ_i(θ)² as quaternions; squaring preserves the rotation axis; every ζ_N braid word is a valid doubled word in ζ</em>{2N}. PROVED algebraically, confirmed computationally for ζ_8 → ζ_16 (13/13, 0.000°).</li>
<li><strong>Result (Trivialization)</strong>: At ~3,457+ Voronoi cells (ζ_16 resolution), approximately 90% of all XOR6 triples become solutions. The activation function has so many cells that most cells see at most one of the 64 binary input vectors — pigeonhole statistics dominate topology. DEMONSTRATED.</li>
<li><strong>Conjecture (Trivialization threshold)</strong>: The transition from topology-driven to pigeonhole-dominated computation lies between ~50 and ~500 Voronoi cells. Below this threshold the geometry of directions matters; above it statistics dominate. CONJECTURED; threshold not yet precisely located.</li>
<li><strong>Result (ζ_32 nesting)</strong>: The 5 missing ζ_8 directions in the ζ_32 catalog are a cap artifact, not genuine geometric independence. The 2.07° drift on the 8 found directions reflects accumulated numerical error from composing many small-angle rotations. STRONGLY SUPPORTED, not yet confirmed at 13/13.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>ζ_8: 24 quaternions, 13 directions, ~5,500 braids enumerated</li>
<li>ζ_16: 7,952 quaternions, 3,457 directions, ~5,500 braids enumerated</li>
<li>ζ_32: 32,768+ quaternions (cap: MAX_QCAT=32768), 4,096+ directions (cap: MAX_ECAT=4096)</li>
<li>ζ_8 → ζ_16 nesting: 13/13, avg 0.0000°, max 0.0000° — RIGIDITY</li>
<li>ζ_8 → ζ_32 nesting (large cap): 8/13, max drift 2.07° — DRIFT (cap artifact)</li>
<li>ζ_8 → ζ_32 nesting (small cap): 6/13, max drift 10.9° — INDEPENDENCE (cap artifact)</li>
<li>XOR6 solutions: ζ_8 Voronoi: 36 (2.57 sol/cell); ζ_16 Voronoi: 499,367 (144.4 sol/cell, 90.6%); ζ_32 Voronoi: 493,654 (120.5 sol/cell, 89.6%)</li>
<li>Fixed-resolution at 16 cells: ζ_16: 450 solutions; ζ_32: 393 solutions</li>
<li>Braid group sizes: ζ_8 = binary octahedral (48 elements, 24 mod ±1); ζ_16 ~16,000 elements; ζ_32 ≥65,536 elements (generator cos π/16 ∉ Q, group is infinite)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-root catalog enumeration</strong>: generates quaternion and eigenvector catalogs for arbitrary ζ_N with configurable MAX_QCAT and MAX_ECAT caps; same braid enumeration depth (~5,500) across all roots for fair comparison</li>
<li><strong>Direction nesting comparator</strong>: for each ζ<em>8 direction, finds nearest match in ζ</em>{2N} catalog and reports angular distance; classifies result as RIGIDITY (0°), DRIFT (small positive), or INDEPENDENCE (large positive)</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Voronoi XOR6 search</strong>: builds natural Voronoi from catalog directions, then enumerates all weight triples for XOR6 solutions; reports sol/cell and % of C(150,3)</li>
<li><strong>Fixed-resolution grid activation</strong>: lat/lon grid with specified cell count applied to all three root catalogs for apples-to-apples comparison</li>
</ul>
<h3>Literature Touched</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aizenberg (2008): k-sector MVN activation; the trivialization result shows that at sufficiently fine resolution Aizenberg-style activation loses discriminative power entirely</li>
<li>Conway &amp; Smith (2003): binary octahedral group and its 24 quaternions — the ζ_8 ground case whose structure nests universally</li>
<li>Birman (1974) / braid group theory: the tower ζ_8 ⊂ ζ_16 ⊂ ζ_32 ⊂ ... is a tower of finite quotients of the infinite braid group</li>
<li>Nazer &amp; Gastpar / Habiro / Abramsky / TL non-semisimplicity (background DKC literature arc, confirmed novel connection)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trivialization threshold</strong>: Where exactly does XOR6 transition from topology-driven (36 solutions at 14 cells) to pigeonhole-dominated (~90% at 3,458 cells)? Likely 50–500 cells but not yet located precisely.</li>
<li><strong>ζ_32 full confirmation</strong>: With uncapped enumeration, do all 13 ζ_8 directions appear in ζ_32 at exactly 0° drift? The algebraic argument says yes; computational confirmation requires deeper catalog.</li>
<li><strong>XOR6 solutions at intermediate resolutions</strong>: Is the solution count monotonically increasing with cell count, or does it have a non-monotonic peak analogous to <a href="./demo_50.html">Demo 50</a>'s k=6 result?</li>
<li><strong>Optimal root for fixed compute budget</strong>: Given a cap on enumeration depth, which root maximizes XOR6 solutions at fixed cell count? <a href="./demo_69.html">Demo 69</a> shows ζ_16 &gt; ζ_32 at 16 cells, but the full curve is unmapped.</li>
<li><strong>Nesting across non-power-of-2 roots</strong>: The algebraic argument requires ζ<em>N = (ζ</em>{2N})^2. Does any form of nesting hold for e.g. ζ_8 ⊂ ζ_24 (ζ_8 = (ζ_24)^3)?</li>
