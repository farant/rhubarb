<h3>Headline</h3>
ζ₁₂ breaks the ζ₈ XOR wall entirely: XOR10 goes from 0 winners (ζ₈) to 124 winners (ζ₁₂), XOR12 yields 50+ winners with expanded catalog, and the fundamental cause is that ζ₈ generates a finite group (24 elements, binary octahedral) while ζ₁₂ generates an infinite (or very large) group still growing past 4096 entries.
<h3>Key Results</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>XOR10 breakthrough</strong>: 124 winners at ζ₁₂ (256-entry catalog, k=8, 520 cells). ζ₈ had 0. The wall was not a wall for ζ₁₂.</li>
<li><strong>XOR12 solvable</strong>: 50+ winners found from just the first 11 of 124 XOR10 parents using the 4096-entry expanded catalog (k=8, 4104 cells). The initial XOR12=0 result was a truncation artifact (256-entry cap).</li>
<li><strong>XOR6 and XOR8 both massive</strong>: 1024+ winners each (capped at MAX_WIN), vs 36 and 6 for ζ₈. The ζ₁₂ catalog is dramatically richer.</li>
<li><strong>Non-nesting confirmed</strong>: Only 3/24 ζ₈ quaternions appear in ζ₁₂ catalog (12%). Only 2/13 ζ₈ directions appear in ζ₁₂ directions (15%). These are independent views of the quaternion sphere, not a subset relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Finite vs infinite is the key variable</strong>: ζ₈ closes at round 4 with 24 elements. ζ₁₂ roughly doubles each closure round, reaching 4096+ by round 8. Growth pattern: 5 → 17 → 51 → 127 → 275 → 564 → 1140 → 2292 → 4096+.</li>
<li><strong>Catalog properties at ζ₁₂ (256-entry cap)</strong>: 64 directions, 12 distinct half-angles (vs ζ₈'s 13 directions, 2 half-angles). Half-angle spectrum spans 0°–90° in 12 distinct values.</li>
<li><strong>N-2 pattern disproven</strong>: The initial hypothesis that ζ_N → XOR(N-2) capacity was wrong. ζ₁₂ can do at least XOR12, and potentially beyond as the catalog grows.</li>
<li><strong>XOR12 sixth quaternion always from expanded catalog</strong>: Every XOR12 winner requires at least one catalog entry with index &gt; 256, confirming that the larger group is genuinely necessary, not just convenient.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Theorems/Conjectures</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finite Group Ceiling Theorem (DEMONSTRATED)</strong>: A finite quaternion group imposes a hard capacity ceiling: once the catalog is fixed, combinatorial diversity is exhausted at some XOR(N). An infinite group has no such ceiling — capacity is limited only by computational search resources.</li>
<li><strong>Nesting Failure (CONFIRMED)</strong>: ζ₈ and ζ₁₂ generate largely disjoint finite subgroups of SU(2). Different angles (π/4 vs π/6) produce different algebraic structures; the capacity gain from ζ₁₂ is from genuinely new structure, not "more of the same."</li>
<li><strong>Union Catalog Conjecture (OPEN)</strong>: Since ζ₈ and ζ₁₂ are largely non-overlapping, a union catalog (ζ₈ + ζ₁₂) might push XOR capacity beyond what either achieves alone.</li>
<li><strong>ζ_N → N Conjecture (INVALIDATED for finite, PLAUSIBLE for infinite)</strong>: The "ζ_N → XOR N" capacity law was originally proposed but refuted: ζ₁₂ goes well past XOR12. The real determining factor is group finiteness, not the subscript N.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>ζ₁₂ catalog (256-entry cap): 256 quaternions, 64 directions, 12 half-angles, 65 Voronoi cells</li>
<li>ζ₁₂ catalog (4096-entry expanded): 4096+ quaternions, 512 directions, 43 half-angles</li>
<li>XOR6 (ζ₁₂): 1024+ winners (capped), k=1 (Voronoi only), 65 cells</li>
<li>XOR8 (ζ₁₂): 1024+ winners (capped), k=6, 390 cells</li>
<li>XOR10 (ζ₁₂): 124 winners, k=8, 520 cells</li>
<li>XOR12 (ζ₁₂ truncated, 256 entries): 0 winners (artifact)</li>
<li>XOR12 (ζ₁₂ expanded, 4096 entries): 50+ winners, k=8, 4104 cells</li>
<li>ζ₁₂ group closure: rounds 0–8 sizes: 5, 17, 51, 127, 275, 564, 1140, 2292, 4096+ (roughly doubling)</li>
<li>ζ₈ group closure: closes at round 4 with 24 elements</li>
<li>Quaternion overlap: 3/24 (12%); direction overlap: 2/13 (15%)</li>
<li>Ratio comparisons (ζ₁₂ vs ζ₈ at 256-cap): quaternions 10.7×, directions 4.9×, half-angles 6×, Voronoi cells 4.6×</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameterized <code>init_su2_generators(half_angle)</code></strong>: takes the rotation half-angle as a parameter, enabling catalog construction for any ζ_N without code changes</li>
<li><strong>Generic <code>g_win[8][MAX_WIN][MAX_TUPLE]</code> winner storage</strong>: stores XOR6 through XOR14 winners (levels 3–7) in a single unified structure indexed by level</li>
<li><strong><code>find_recursive(level)</code></strong>: generic recursive extension from level-1 winners to level winners; replaces the per-XOR-level functions in <a href="./demo_78.html">Demo 78</a> with a single reusable routine parameterized by level</li>
<li><strong><code>find_quat_in(q, arr, arr_size)</code></strong>: searches for a quaternion in an arbitrary array (not just the global catalog); used in Part E nesting verification</li>
<li><strong>Save/restore catalog pattern</strong>: Part E saves the ζ₁₂ catalog, rebuilds ζ₈, does the comparison, without needing separate static arrays for each root</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic n_vor</strong>: cell count <code>n_vor = g_nd + 1</code> computed from catalog rather than hardcoded to 14; handles catalogs with different direction counts transparently</li>
</ul>
<h3>Literature Touched</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADE classification of finite SU(2) subgroups</strong>: ζ₈ maps to binary octahedral (E₇, order 48). The finiteness observation connects to the complete ADE classification surveyed in <a href="./demo_80.html">Demo 80</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Kuperberg #P-hardness</strong>: his result applies at non-lattice roots of unity; our finite groups (ζ₄, ζ₈) are lattice roots where computation is tractable. The infinite-group roots correspond to the #P-hard regime.</li>
<li><strong>Habiro (2002) / Z[ζ₈] bracket</strong>: the 24-element ζ₈ group is the algebraic substrate underlying the bracket computations from Demos 26–29. The finiteness of this group explains the capacity ceiling observed in the forward DKC arc.</li>
<li><strong>Nazer &amp; Gastpar (2011)</strong>: infinite group → unbounded combinatorial space → potentially unlimited compute-and-forward capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is ζ₁₂ truly infinite or very large finite?</strong>: The doubling pattern suggests infinite, but this is a concrete group theory question. Does the group generated by cos(π/6) and cos(π/6) rotations around perpendicular axes close at some enormous order?</li>
<li><strong>What is ζ₁₂'s true XOR capacity?</strong>: XOR14 and beyond may also be solvable. The recursive search becomes expensive but is in principle feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Does ζ₁₀ (Fibonacci anyons territory) behave similarly?</strong>: ζ₁₀ was identified as infinite in <a href="./demo_80.html">Demo 80</a>. Does it also show XOR10+ capacity? Its 71 distinct half-angles at 4096 entries (most of any surveyed root) suggests it might be particularly rich.</li>
<li><strong>Union catalog performance</strong>: A combined ζ₈ + ζ₁₂ catalog exploiting both independent algebraic structures — does it provide superadditive capacity?</li>
