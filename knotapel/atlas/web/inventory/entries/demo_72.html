    <h2>Demo 72: Spherical Design Test — Are the 13 Directions Optimal?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: COMPLETE</li>
<li><strong>File</strong>: <code><a href="../../demo_72_spherical_design/main.c.html">demo_72_spherical_design/main.c</a></code> (~971 lines)</li>
<li><strong>Tests</strong>: 8/8 pass</li>
<li><strong>Depends on</strong>: Demo 67 (13 eigenvector directions on S², 36 XOR6 solutions), Demo 71 (DKC bandwidth l=6, DOF argument)</li>
<li><strong>Feeds into</strong>: Demo 73 (automaton structure), Demo 74 (computational invariant)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Headline</h3>
The 13 eigenvector directions are NOT a spherical t-design (t=0, directed) — the worst possible for sampling — yet stochastic optimization confirms that better geometric distribution gives fewer XOR6 solutions (36 vs 4), establishing an anti-correlation between sampling quality and computational quality.
<h3>Key Results</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>t=0 directed (Part A)</strong>: The 13 directions fail the t-design property at l=1 (centroid off-origin, |S_{1,m}|=2.43). Exactly l=2 passes at machine precision (|S_{2,m}|=5.11e-16). Fails at all subsequent levels through l=8+.</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth gap (Part B)</strong>: DKC operates at bandwidth l=6 (Demo 71) but the directions achieve t=0. The gap of 6 modes is entirely filled by compressed sensing and the DOF argument — classical sampling theory does not apply.</li>
<li><strong>Even/odd mode asymmetry (Part C)</strong>: Directed even-mode t-design is t_even=2 (l=2 passes); directed odd-mode is t_odd=0. Undirected (26 points, both +dir and -dir) achieves t=3 because antipodal symmetry kills all odd modes automatically. First genuine failure for DKC-relevant even modes is l=4 (|S_{4,m}|=0.576).</li>
<li><strong>S³ design (Part D)</strong>: The full 48-element binary octahedral group on S³ achieves t=1. Odd degrees are exactly zero by symmetry; even degrees fail. The 24-cell vertices (binary tetrahedral subgroup) form a 5-design; the additional 24 elements break the property at degree 2.</li>
<li><strong>Delsarte bounds (Part E)</strong>: With 13 points, t-designs up to t=7 are theoretically possible (Delsarte minimum for t=7 is 10 points). The actual achievement (t=0) is the worst possible given that the points trivially satisfy no integration condition.</li>
<li><strong>Residual analysis (Part F)</strong>: First failing mode is l=1 (odd mode, irrelevant for DKC). All three l=1 components are large (max 2.435). The effective first failure for DKC is l=4 (even mode, residual 0.576).</li>
<li><strong>Optimized design gets fewer solutions (Part G)</strong>: Stochastic optimization of 13 points to minimize t=6 design residual achieved residual 0.93 (vs 2.43 for eigenvectors — 2.6× better geometry). XOR6 solutions: eigenvector 36, optimized 4. Better geometry destroys the computation.</li>
<li><strong>Perturbation robustness (Part H)</strong>: At 1° perturbation mean XOR6 count is 38 (slightly above unperturbed 36, showing some near-miss solutions exist). Robust through 5° (mean 35.8). Collapses at 10° (mean 11.5) and 20° (mean 2.1). The algebraic placement is sharp to ~5°.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Theorems/Conjectures</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-Correlation Theorem (DEMONSTRATED)</strong>: The 13 eigenvector directions are simultaneously the worst choice for spherical integration (t=0) and a locally optimal choice for DKC computation (36 vs 4 solutions for better-distributed directions). Sampling quality and computational quality are anti-correlated for this configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Algebra &gt; Geometry Principle (DEMONSTRATED)</strong>: The DKC computation is algebraic, not geometric. The directions are selected by the binary octahedral group acting on Z[ζ_8] quaternions; they compute because of specific angular relationships, not uniform distribution. Moving directions to "better" positions (geometrically) destroys the Voronoi partition structure needed for XOR6.</li>
<li><strong>DOF-not-Design Conjecture (SUPPORTED)</strong>: The reason DKC works at bandwidth l=6 with only 13 directions (well below Nyquist) is the DOF coincidence 2×6+1=13=directions, combined with compressed sensing for binary functions at known positions. The t-design property is irrelevant to this mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Literature Touched</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delsarte, Goethals, Seidel (1977)</strong>: lower bounds on N for spherical t-designs on S^d; the t=7 feasibility bound for N=13 comes from this framework</li>
<li><strong>Seymour &amp; Zaslavsky (1984)</strong>: existence of spherical t-designs for all t and N large enough; establishes that the eigenvector configuration is far from optimal despite being algebraically distinguished</li>
<li><strong>Aizenberg (2008)</strong>: the algebraic selection of directions by the MVN/DKC mechanism is the reason the t-design property is irrelevant; the paper's framework predicts directions from algebraic rather than geometric criteria</li>
<li><strong>Compressed sensing (Candès, Romberg, Tao 2006)</strong>: the DOF-not-Design explanation relies on sparsity at known positions bypassing the Nyquist-Shannon/spherical-design sampling requirement</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is 5° the Voronoi cell boundary?</strong>: The robustness threshold of ~5° matches the typical angular size of a Voronoi cell for 13 points on S². Is there a clean geometric formula relating cell angular radius to robustness threshold?</li>
<li><strong>Why exactly l=2 passes?</strong>: The l=2 mode vanishes to machine precision despite t=0 overall. This suggests a hidden quadrupole symmetry in the binary octahedral group action. What algebraic identity ensures Σ Y_{2,m}(dir_i)=0?</li>
<li><strong>Optimized design lower bound</strong>: The stochastic optimizer found 4 solutions for the "better" design. Is 0 achievable? Is there a geometric argument that any t≥1 spherical design on S² yields fewer XOR6 solutions than the algebraic eigenvector configuration?</li>
<li><strong>Perturbation non-monotonicity</strong>: Small perturbations (1°) slightly increase the mean solution count (38 &gt; 36). Can the maximum XOR6 solution count for any 13-point configuration on S² be characterized? Is 36 a local or global maximum?</li>
<li><strong>Analog for higher Boolean functions</strong>: XOR6 uses l=6, 13 directions. For XOR7 on S², what is the expected t-design parameter of the algebraically-selected directions, and does the anti-correlation persist?</li>
