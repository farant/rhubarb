    <h2><a href="./demo_80.html">Demo 80</a>: Group Finiteness Survey</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: COMPLETE</li>
<li><strong>File</strong>: <code><a href="../../demo_80_group_finiteness/main.c.html">demo_80_group_finiteness/main.c</a></code> (~467 lines)</li>
<li><strong>Tests</strong>: 11/11 pass</li>
<li><strong>Depends on</strong>: <a href="./demo_79.html">Demo 79</a> (finite vs infinite group hypothesis), <a href="./demo_78.html">Demo 78</a> (ζ₈ wall at XOR10), <a href="./demo_66.html">Demo 66</a> (binary octahedral group = 24 elements)</li>
<li><strong>Feeds into</strong>: Future demos selecting which ζ_N to use for extended XOR capacity; ADE/quantum group connections</li>
</ul>
<h3>Headline</h3>
Only ζ₄ and ζ₈ generate finite SU(2) subgroups under the standard two-generator construction; all other tested roots (ζ₆, ζ₁₀, ζ₁₂, ζ₁₆, ζ₂₀) generate infinite groups, the finite cases correspond exactly to rotations by π/2 and π/4 which are symmetries of the cube/octahedron, and at ζ₈ the quantum dimension [2]_q vanishes — the most singular point of quantum group parameter space.
<h3>Key Results</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Only ζ₄ and ζ₈ finite</strong>: Of 7 roots tested (N = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20), only ζ₄ (4 elements, binary dihedral Q₄) and ζ₈ (24 elements, binary octahedral) close under group multiplication.</li>
<li><strong>Non-monotonic boundary</strong>: ζ₆ is infinite despite sitting between the two finite cases. Finiteness is NOT a monotone function of N. The pattern is: finite(4), infinite(6), finite(8), infinite(10,12,16,20,...).</li>
<li><strong>ADE identification</strong>: ζ₄ → Binary Dihedral 2D₂ (order 8, the quaternion group Q₈ = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}). ζ₈ → Binary Octahedral 2O (order 48, E₇ in ADE classification).</li>
<li><strong>ζ₁₀ is NOT binary icosahedral</strong>: Despite π/5 being the golden ratio angle (Fibonacci anyons territory), ζ₁₀ generates an infinite group. The binary icosahedral group (order 120, E₈) is not reached by this generator construction.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite groups approach continuum</strong>: All infinite groups at 4096 entries show 512 directions (saturated MAX_DIR), 37–71 distinct half-angles, minimum angle gaps &lt; 1° (approaching dense subgroup of SU(2)).</li>
<li><strong>Non-monotone angle counts</strong>: ζ₁₀ has 71 half-angles at 4096 entries vs ζ₁₂'s 43 and ζ₁₆'s 51. Different infinite groups have different density structures despite similar closure behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Algebraic diagnosis</strong>: cos(π/2) = 0 (rational) and cos(π/4) = √2/2 (degree 2) generate finite groups. cos(π/3) = 1/2 (rational!) generates infinite. Algebraic degree alone does not predict finiteness.</li>
<li><strong>Geometric characterization</strong>: The finite cases are exactly the angles that are rotational symmetries of the cube/octahedron. π/2 and π/4 rotations around perpendicular axes generate the octahedral symmetry group and close. π/3 rotations are symmetries of the hexagonal lattice but two perpendicular hexagonal axes generate an infinite group.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Theorems/Conjectures</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power-of-Two Finiteness Conjecture (PROPOSED)</strong>: The finite cases under this construction are exactly angles of the form π/2^k for k ≥ 1. This predicts θ = π/2 (k=1, ζ₄) and θ = π/4 (k=2, ζ₈), and further predicts ζ₃₂ (θ = π/16) should also be finite. Not yet tested.</li>
<li><strong>ADE Exhaustion (DEMONSTRATED for E₇)</strong>: ζ₈ → Binary Octahedral → E₇. The ζ₄ → Binary Dihedral is the D-series. E₆ (binary tetrahedral, 24 elements) and E₈ (binary icosahedral, 120 elements) are not reachable under the two-perpendicular-axes construction tested here.</li>
<li><strong>Quantum Dimension Vanishing (CONFIRMED)</strong>: At ζ₈, q = i, and [2]_q = q + q⁻¹ = i + (-i) = 0. The quantum dimension vanishes. The two finite groups correspond to the lattice (singular) points of quantum group parameter space. Non-lattice roots (all infinite groups) are where Kuperberg's #P-hardness applies.</li>
<li><strong>Dense Subgroup Conjecture (SUPPORTED)</strong>: Infinite groups under this construction generate dense subgroups of SU(2) — the directions approach uniform S² coverage as the group grows. Not proven analytically.</li>
</ul>

<li>ζ₄: 4 elements, 2 closure rounds, 3 directions, 2 half-angles. ADE: Binary Dihedral 2D₂.</li>
<li>ζ₆: &gt;4096 elements, 10 rounds to cap, 512 directions (saturated), 37 half-angles. INFINITE.</li>
<li>ζ₈: 24 elements, 4 closure rounds, 13 directions, 4 half-angles. ADE: Binary Octahedral (E₇).</li>
<li>ζ₁₀: &gt;4096 elements, 7 rounds to cap, 512 directions, 71 half-angles. INFINITE.</li>
<li>ζ₁₂: &gt;4096 elements, 8 rounds to cap, 512 directions, 43 half-angles. INFINITE.</li>

<li>ζ₂₀: &gt;4096 elements, 7 rounds to cap, 512 directions, 67 half-angles. INFINITE.</li>
<li>Finite count: 2. Infinite count: 5.</li>
<li>Quantum dimension [2]_q at ζ₈: exactly 0 (q = i, [2]_q = i + 1/i = i - i = 0).</li>
<li>Angle algebraic degrees: cos(π/2)=0 (rational, finite), cos(π/4)=√2/2 (degree 2, finite), cos(π/3)=1/2 (rational, INFINITE), cos(π/5)=φ/2 (degree 2, INFINITE).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>build_closure(rounds_out)</code></strong>: generic group closure algorithm; starts from generators + inverses + identity, multiplies all current elements by all generators each round, stops when no new elements are added or MAX_QCAT is hit; returns 1 if finite, 0 if hit cap</li>
<li><strong><code>test_root(N)</code></strong>: complete per-root survey: init generators at half_angle=2π/N, run closure, count directions, count angles, identify ADE type, print and store in results array</li>
<li><strong><code>identify_ade(order)</code></strong>: maps group size to ADE classification; handles binary tetrahedral (order 12), octahedral (24), icosahedral (60), binary dihedral (4n), cyclic (n)</li>
<li><strong><code>analyze_direction_distribution()</code></strong>: for infinite groups, reports S² octant coverage and angle gap statistics to characterize density structure</li>
<li><strong><code>RootResult</code> struct</strong>: compact storage for per-root survey results (N, angle, finite flag, size, rounds, dirs, angles, ADE string); enables summary table across all roots</li>
<li><strong><code>count_angles()</code> with bubble sort</strong>: collects distinct half-angles with 0.1° tolerance, sorts ascending; pattern for angle census reusable in any catalog analysis</li>
<li><strong>Closure vs brute-word-enumeration tradeoff</strong>: <a href="./demo_80.html">Demo 80</a> uses true group closure (multiply existing elements by generators) rather than <a href="./demo_78.html">Demo 78</a>'s enumerate-all-words approach; closure is exact and efficient for finite groups, and correctly identifies infinite groups by hitting the cap</li>
</ul>
<h3>Literature Touched</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADE classification of finite subgroups of SU(2)</strong>: the complete classification (cyclic, binary dihedral, binary tetrahedral/octahedral/icosahedral) is the organizing framework. Our construction reaches only two of the exceptional cases.</li>
<li><strong>Kuperberg (1994, 1996) #P-hardness of Jones polynomial</strong>: hardness applies at non-lattice roots of unity; the lattice roots ζ₄ and ζ₈ where [2]_q ∈ {-2, 0} are exactly our finite cases and the tractable computational regime.</li>
<li><strong>Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT</strong>: the finite subgroups of SU(2) are the building blocks of WRT invariants; the ADE classification connects to the Dynkin diagram structure of the relevant quantum groups.</li>
<li><strong>Fibonacci anyons / topological quantum computation</strong>: ζ₁₀ (angle π/5, golden ratio) is the relevant parameter for Fibonacci anyons and universal quantum computation via braiding. Our finding that ζ₁₀ generates an infinite group is consistent with its use in quantum computation: the infinite group provides universal coverage of SU(2).</li>
<li><strong>Habiro (2002)</strong>: the Z[ζ₈] bracket from the DKC arc lives at the ζ₈ = E₇ point; the finiteness of this group is the algebraic foundation of the finite capacity ceiling demonstrated in Demos 76–78.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is ζ₃₂ (θ = π/16) finite?</strong>: The power-of-two conjecture predicts yes. A single additional test_root(32) call would confirm or refute.</li>
<li><strong>Why do perpendicular π/3 rotations not close?</strong>: The geometric argument (hexagonal symmetry vs octahedral symmetry) explains the result intuitively but a rigorous algebraic proof of why exactly π/2 and π/4 are special has not been given.</li>
<li><strong>Do all infinite groups give unbounded XOR capacity?</strong>: <a href="./demo_79.html">Demo 79</a> confirmed ζ₁₂ (infinite) breaks the ζ₈ wall. But do all infinite groups provide unbounded capacity, or do some infinite groups have structural limitations that impose their own ceilings?</li>
<li><strong>Which infinite group is computationally optimal?</strong>: ζ₁₀ has the most half-angles at 4096 entries (71) of all surveyed roots. Does more angular diversity directly translate to easier XOR computation and lower minimum k values?</li>
<li><strong>E₆ and E₈ reachability</strong>: Binary tetrahedral (order 24, E₆) and binary icosahedral (order 120, E₈) are not reached by the two-perpendicular-axes generator construction. Is there a different natural generator construction that reaches them?</li>
