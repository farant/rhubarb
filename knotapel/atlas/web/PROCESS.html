    <h1>Atlas Defrag Process</h1>
<p>The atlas is an organized synthesis of all knotapel research. It is regenerated periodically as demos accumulate, ensuring the research remains navigable without re-reading every demo from scratch.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readonly outside atlas/</strong>: Defrag agents READ from demo dirs, proofs/, explorer's log, research/, future-demos/. They WRITE only to atlas/. Nothing outside atlas/ is ever modified.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory vs Synthesis</strong>: Some artifacts are pure extraction ("what do we have"), others are interpretation ("what does it mean"). Both are necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Repeatable</strong>: The process can be re-run. Incremental updates are preferred (check <a href="./inventory/demo-index.html">demo-index.md</a> for what's already cataloged), but full rebuilds are fine too.</li>
<li><strong>Parallelizable</strong>: Phases 1 and 2 split across agents. Phases 3-5 are sequential.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sources</h2>
<p>The defrag reads from these directories (all readonly during defrag):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>demo_*/</code> — Demo source code and findings</li>
<li><code>proofs/</code> — Formal mathematical proofs (*.md). Each proof upgrades a result from VERIFIED/CONJECTURED to PROVEN in the atlas. Proofs should be indexed in <code><a href="./inventory/proofs-index.html">inventory/proofs-index.md</a></code> and propagated to <a href="./inventory/theorems.html">theorems.md</a>, <a href="./synthesis/narrative.html">narrative.md</a>, <a href="./synthesis/novelty.html">novelty.md</a>, and <a href="./planning/next-priorities.html">next-priorities.md</a>.</li>
<li><code>future-demos/</code> — Proposed demo ideas with dependencies</li>
<li><code>research/</code> — External literature notes (read by Phase 2 literature agent)</li>
<li><code>explorers-log.md</code> — Running research log</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phases</h2>
<h3>Phase 1: Inventory Extraction (parallelizable)</h3>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: Each demo's <a href="./demo_78_recursive_scaling/main.c.html">main.c</a>, findings.md, README.md, and any other .md files in the demo dir. Also: new files in <code>proofs/</code>. <strong>Output</strong>: Entries appended to <code><a href="./inventory/demo-index.html">inventory/demo-index.md</a></code>. New proofs indexed in <code><a href="./inventory/proofs-index.html">inventory/proofs-index.md</a></code>.</p>
<p>Each demo gets a standardized entry:</p>
<p><code></code>`markdown <h2>Demo NN: &lt;title&gt;</h2></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: COMPLETE | IN PROGRESS | PLANNED</li>
<li><strong>File</strong>: <code>demo_NN_name/main.c</code> (~lines)</li>
<li><strong>Tests</strong>: X/X pass</li>
<li><strong>Depends on</strong>: demo numbers this builds on</li>
<li><strong>Feeds into</strong>: demo numbers that build on this</li>
</ul>
<h3>Headline</h3>
One sentence: the key result.
<h3>Key Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bullet list of specific findings, data points, confirmed/refuted hypotheses</li>
</ul>
<h3>Theorems/Conjectures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Named results with status (PROVEN / CONJECTURED / REFUTED)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Key numerical values, tables, or catalogs produced</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reusable code patterns introduced (e.g., "Cyc8 exact arithmetic", "planar matching enumeration")</li>
</ul>
<h3>Literature Touched</h3>
<ul>
<li>Papers referenced or discovered during this demo</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Questions raised but not answered by this demo <code></code>`</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parallelization</strong>: Use a <strong>worker pool</strong> pattern: 4 persistent agents, each assigned 1 demo at a time. When an agent finishes, feed it the next unprocessed demo. Each agent writes to <code>inventory/entries/demo_NN.md</code>. Team lead merges all entries into <code><a href="./inventory/demo-index.html">demo-index.md</a></code> when complete.</p>
<p>Why worker pool, not fixed batches: Agent context windows cannot handle 10+ demos in one session. One demo per assignment keeps each agent focused and prevents context blowouts. 4 workers gives good throughput without overwhelming coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Spot check</strong>: After the first 4-8 entries are written, read 2-3 at random to verify quality before processing all remaining demos.</p>
<h3>Phase 2: Data Consolidation (parallelizable)</h3>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: <a href="./inventory/demo-index.html">demo-index.md</a> from Phase 1 + original demo files as needed. <strong>Output</strong>: Multiple files, one per agent. Existing agents (A-E) plus new extraction agents (F-I).</p>
<h4>Existing Agents (A-E)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Agent A -&gt; <code><a href="./inventory/theorems.html">inventory/theorems.md</a></code>: Extract all theorems/conjectures from demo-index entries, organize by topic, track status.</li>
<li>Agent B -&gt; <code><a href="./inventory/data-tables.html">inventory/data-tables.md</a></code>: Extract all key numerical tables (axiality hierarchy, radical dimensions, DKC landscape matrix, catalog sizes, compression ratios, etc.)</li>
<li>Agent C -&gt; <code><a href="./research/literature-index.html">research/literature-index.md</a></code> + <code><a href="./research/five-pillars.html">research/five-pillars.md</a></code> + <code><a href="./research/key-sources.html">research/key-sources.md</a></code>: Consolidate all literature references across demos, deduplicate, tag.</li>
<li>Agent D -&gt; <code><a href="./inventory/code-assets.html">inventory/code-assets.md</a></code>: Catalog reusable code patterns with which demo introduced them and which demos reuse them.</li>
<li>Agent E -&gt; <code><a href="./inventory/floating-point-audit.html">inventory/floating-point-audit.md</a></code>: For each new/modified demo, read <a href="./demo_78_recursive_scaling/main.c.html">main.c</a> and classify its floating-point usage (INTEGER, DISPLAY-ONLY, VALIDATION, EXACT-CORE, GEOMETRIC, STATISTICAL, or MIXED). Update the audit table, summary counts, and regime descriptions. This tracks the boundary between exact and FP computation across the codebase.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Agents (F-I)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Agent F -&gt; <code><a href="./synthesis/dead-ends.html">synthesis/dead-ends.md</a></code>: Extract all negative results and "wall was X not Y" resolution patterns from demo findings, explorer's log, and demo-index entries. For each dead end: what was tried, why it failed (specific mechanism), what it taught us, demo reference, and critically: "do not re-attempt unless [specific condition]". For each wall pattern: what looked impossible, diagnosis of which component enforced it, what was changed, the mechanism, and the generalizable lesson. Organize by research question attacked. This is the highest-ROI document for preventing duplicate work across context resets.</li>
<li>Agent G -&gt; <code><a href="./synthesis/glossary.html">synthesis/glossary.md</a></code>: Extract 40-60 key terms that appear across the atlas. Each entry gets: plain-language definition (one sentence, no jargon), precise definition (one sentence, technical), demo where first introduced, cross-references to related terms. Alphabetical order. Append-only maintenance — new terms added each defrag. Sourced from <a href="./briefing.html">briefing.md</a>, <a href="./synthesis/narrative.html">narrative.md</a>, <a href="./inventory/theorems.html">theorems.md</a>, and demo-index entries.</li>
<li>Agent H -&gt; <code><a href="./inventory/algebraic-structures.html">inventory/algebraic-structures.md</a></code>: Catalog every algebraic object encountered across demos — groups (binary octahedral, binary icosahedral, braid groups), rings (Z[i], Z[omega], Z[zeta_8], Z[zeta_12], Z[zeta_16]), algebras (TL_l at each l), polytopes (24-cell), modules (standard, projective, Delta_1, W_{n,k}). For each: classification data, key invariants (dimension, order, generators), which demos use it, and cross-references. Consolidates scattered references (e.g., the binary octahedral group is discussed across 9+ demos with no single entry).</li>
<li>Agent I -&gt; <code><a href="./inventory/conjecture-graph.html">inventory/conjecture-graph.md</a></code>: Build a directed graph of all open conjectures and proven theorems with implication edges (if we prove X, what follows?). Identify equivalence classes, critical paths, and high-leverage proof targets. Source from <a href="./inventory/theorems.html">theorems.md</a> and <a href="./planning/research-questions.html">research-questions.md</a>. Include upgrade paths: what proof technique would likely work for each open conjecture. The extraction part (listing nodes and edges) is Phase 2; the strategic analysis (which to prove next) feeds into Phase 4 planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT — Assign tasks explicitly per agent.</strong> Do NOT use a shared task list that agents can self-assign from. In the initial run, one agent finished its own task and then grabbed another agent's task, producing duplicate files that had to be manually merged. Set explicit ownership before launching.</p>
<h3>Phase 3: Synthesis (agent drafts + conversational review)</h3>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: All inventory and research files from Phases 1-2. <strong>Output</strong>: synthesis/ directory files.</p>
<p>Effective workflow: spawn 8-9 agents in parallel to draft initial versions (they do the heavy reading of inventory material), then review each draft conversationally with the human. The agents handle extraction; the human handles judgment. Expect minor edits, not rewrites — if the inventory phase was thorough, the synthesis drafts are usually solid.</p>
<h4>Existing Synthesis Documents</h4>
<ul>
<li><code><a href="./synthesis/narrative.html">narrative.md</a></code>: The research story arc, organized by conceptual progression not chronology</li>
<li><code><a href="./synthesis/four-lenses.html">four-lenses.md</a></code>: Current state of each lens (rep theory, coding, QM, approx theory)</li>
<li><code><a href="./synthesis/connections.html">connections.md</a></code>: Cross-demo themes and how things feed each other</li>
<li><code><a href="./synthesis/novelty.html">novelty.md</a></code>: What's known in the literature, what's novel, what's in between</li>
<li><code><a href="./synthesis/vision-alignment.html">vision-alignment.md</a></code>: How current work relates to the long-term vision (<code><a href="./planning/vision.html">planning/vision.md</a></code>). This bridges synthesis (backward-looking) and planning (forward-looking). Reads the other four synthesis docs + the vision doc and assesses: progress toward vision, new opportunities, course corrections, shortest paths to vision milestones, and recommended next investigations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Synthesis Documents</h4>
<ul>
<li><code><a href="./synthesis/arc-summaries.html">arc-summaries.md</a></code>: Group demos into their natural research arcs (17+ arcs) and summarize each as a self-contained unit. Per arc: the question it attacked, the answer it found, the journey (3-5 bullets: what was tried, what failed, what worked, what surprised), key artifacts produced, what it unlocked (which later arcs depend on it), and open threads. This is the backbone document — organized by intellectual unit rather than demo number or chronology. Build this BEFORE key-insights and obstructions, as both reference it. Important for the explorer role (thinks at arc level) and for paper planning (each paper ~ 1-3 arcs).</li>
<li><code><a href="./synthesis/obstructions.html">obstructions.md</a></code>: A partial order of all impossibility results organized by mechanism type (convexity, pigeonhole, valuation failure, group-finiteness, encoding lock, etc.). For each obstruction: precise statement, mechanism, scope (which parameters it applies to), known bypass routes, and which walls survive if you change parameter X. The research has at least three independent obstruction families; this document makes that structure explicit. Reads from <a href="./synthesis/dead-ends.html">dead-ends.md</a> (Phase 2) + <a href="./inventory/theorems.html">theorems.md</a> + demo-index entries.</li>
<li><code><a href="./synthesis/prerequisites.html">prerequisites.md</a></code>: A directed acyclic graph of concept dependencies (not demo dependencies). Each node is a concept (e.g., "State Sum", "Non-Semisimplicity", "k-Sector MVN") with a one-sentence definition and a pointer to where it's introduced. The graph shows "to understand X, first understand Y." ~200 lines. The single most impactful document for cold-start onboarding — turns the atlas from a library into a curriculum.</li>
<li><code><a href="./synthesis/key-insights.html">key-insights.md</a></code>: The 10 most important ideas from the research program, each at two levels of depth: Level 1 (one sentence, suitable for a system prompt) and Level 2 (one paragraph, suitable for a graduate student). Level 3 (one page, specialist depth) is a stretch goal for future defrags. The Level 1 sentences are the ultra-compressed version of the project — 10 sentences that capture the shape of everything. Sits between <a href="./briefing.html">briefing.md</a> and <a href="./synthesis/narrative.html">narrative.md</a> in the progressive disclosure stack.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase 4: Planning (sequential)</h3>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: All above + existing future-demos/ folder. <strong>Output</strong>: planning/ directory files.</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href="./planning/future-demos.html">future-demos.md</a></code>: Consolidated from future-demos/ folder + new ideas from synthesis, with dependencies and priorities</li>
<li><code><a href="./planning/research-questions.html">research-questions.md</a></code>: All open questions extracted from demos, organized by topic</li>
<li><code><a href="./planning/next-priorities.html">next-priorities.md</a></code>: What to work on next, informed by the synthesis</li>
<li><code><a href="./planning/vision.html">vision.md</a></code>: Review and update long-term directions. This file captures high-level vision discussions (application directions, architectural ideas, the hybrid LLM thesis, etc.) that are above the level of individual demos. Append new ideas during defrag; don't overwrite existing ones unless they're superseded.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase 5: Briefing (sequential)</h3>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: Everything above. <strong>Output</strong>: <code><a href="./briefing.html">briefing.md</a></code> (~50 lines).</p>
<p>The fast-onboarding document. Read this on every cold start. Contains: <ul> <li>One-paragraph story</li> <li>Key results table (5-10 rows)</li> <li>Current frontier (what we just proved, what's next)</li> <li>Pointers to deeper reading</li> </ul>
<h2>Phase 0: Change Detection (always run first)</h2>
<p>Before any defrag work, run a git-based change scan to identify what needs updating:</p>
<p><code></code>`bash <h1>1. What's changed since last defrag commit?</h1> git diff --stat &lt;last-defrag-commit&gt;..HEAD -- demo_* proofs/ future-demos/ explorers-log.md</p>
<h1>2. What's new/untracked?</h1>
git status -s -- demo_* proofs/ future-demos/
<h1>3. Recent commits touching demo/proof dirs (human-readable)</h1>
git log --oneline &lt;last-defrag-commit&gt;..HEAD -- demo_* proofs/
<code></code>`
<p>This produces three categories of work:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Example</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>New demo dirs</strong></td><td><code>?? demo_63_four_input/</code></td><td>Phase 1: create new entry</td></tr><tr><td><strong>New non-demo dirs</strong></td><td><code>?? proofs/something.md</code></td><td>Phase 1: index in appropriate file</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Modified existing demos</strong></td><td><code>M <a href="./demo_51_radical_anatomy/main.c.html">demo_51_radical_anatomy/main.c</a></code></td><td>Phase 1: RE-READ and update existing entry</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No changes</strong></td><td>(nothing)</td><td>Skip defrag</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The "modified existing demo" case is the one the old process missed — if someone adds tests, fixes bugs, or extends results in an already-cataloged demo, the entry needs updating. The git diff tells you exactly which entries are stale.</p>
<p><strong>Recording the baseline:</strong> After each defrag, note the HEAD commit hash in the defrag history table. This becomes <code>&lt;last-defrag-commit&gt;</code> for the next run.</p>
<h2>Re-running the Defrag</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Run Phase 0</strong> (change detection) to identify new, modified, and untracked items. 2. Run Phase 1 on NEW items (create entries) and MODIFIED items (update existing entries). 3. Re-run Phase 2 (full rebuild — these are fast). 4. Re-run Phase 3-5 (synthesis always needs refresh with new data). 5. Update defrag history with date, commit hash, and notes.</p>
