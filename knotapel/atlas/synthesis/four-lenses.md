# Four Lenses on One Object

The DKC research is one thing seen from four directions. These are not four research programs that happen to share data. They are four coordinate systems on the same manifold. Every major result lives in at least two lenses; the deepest results live in all four.

---

## Lens 1: Representation Theory

**What the research looks like:** The Temperley-Lieb algebra TL_n(delta) at roots of unity is a non-semisimple finite-dimensional algebra whose radical structure controls what the Kauffman bracket can and cannot compute. The radical is not noise. It is the precise algebraic object that separates computable from incomputable Boolean functions.

**Central demos:** D35 (TL_n matrices over Z[zeta_8], the keystone), D39 (Parts G-J: three Gram forms, Markov RT truncation, next-level radical formula), D51 (radical anatomy at delta=0 -- the sandwich theorem, Loewy length 3, Catalan trace theorem, Peirce block matching), D52 (Chebyshev generalization across ell=2-6, universal nilpotency 3, cross-ell radical dimension formulas), D06 (Jones-Wenzl idempotents as module projectors), D85-D86 (indecomposability parameter b = -5/8, projective cover structure, standard module diagonalizability), D102 (Barrington-Radical Principle -- writhe character, radical guaranteed useless for parity), D105 (8-strand modules, macrame principle regime transition), D107 (Z/4Z axis-alignment proof, nesting parity grading, q-Catalan identity, major index bipartite invariant).

**Core results belonging to this lens:**
- The sandwich theorem: rad^2(TL_{2k}(0)) is isomorphic to TL_{2k-1}(0) as a bimodule. Three Loewy layers with dimensional mirrors.
- Alternating semisimplicity: odd n is semisimple, even n is not. TL_3(0) is semisimple despite nilpotent generators.
- Universal nilpotency 3: rad^3 = 0 at ALL roots of unity tested (ell=2-6). The cellularity of TL algebras forces this.
- Fibonacci rank theorem: the total bilinear rank of the rad^2 generator equals F(ell-1). Fibonacci numbers arise from fusion rules in the Bratteli diagram.
- Cross-ell radical dimension formulas: rad(TL_ell) = 2ell-3, rad(TL_{ell+1}) = ell^2-ell-3.
- Markov RT truncation: Markov trace kills j >= ell-1, preserves j <= ell-2. The "shadow interpretation": fixpt = algebraic light, Markov = topological light.
- Next-level radical formula: rad(TL_{ell+1}) = ell^2-ell-3, now formally proven.

**New results (D102, D105, D107):**
- D102 Barrington-Radical Principle (NAMED THEOREM): the radical of a non-semisimple TL module at delta=0 carries an abelian character -- the writhe homomorphism B_n -> Z/8Z (via A = -zeta_8). By Barrington's theorem (1989), abelian groups cannot compute parity. Therefore the radical direction is theoretically guaranteed useless for XOR computation. Computationally confirmed: simple W_{6,0} beats non-simple W_{6,4} at EVERY XOR level (XOR6: 2449 vs 2370, XOR8: 850 vs 793, XOR10: 1 vs 0) despite same dimension (both dim=5). The Writhe Character Theorem is proven for ALL 32,768 catalog entries: M*r = A^{writhe(M)}*r. Radical content is exactly constant (=3) across the entire catalog. This is the sharpest characterization of what the radical IS computationally: it is a frozen 1-dimensional writhe counter, carrying abelian (hence parity-useless) information.
- D102 BFS growth independence (CONFIRMED at n=6): W_{6,0} (dim=5, simple) and W_{6,4} (dim=5, non-simple, rad dim=1) produce bit-for-bit IDENTICAL BFS depth profiles (1, 11, 77, 439, 2233, 10603, 32768). Growth rate ~5x converging, consistent with sl_5 thesis. Growth is a property of the braid group B_n, not the module.
- D102 Fibonacci max-abs in non-simple modules: W_{6,4} max coefficient magnitude follows strict Fibonacci (1,1,2,3,5,8,13) through depth 6, while W_{6,0} breaks to 16 at depth 6. The radical constrains coefficient growth -- a structural consequence of the abelian writhe character acting as a scaling bound on the radical direction.
- D105 macrame principle (CONJECTURED regime transition): branching interaction behavior reverses between small and large sub-module blocks. At n=6 (D104, asymmetric blocks dim 5+4), cross-block (off-diagonal branching) dominates XOR capacity. At n=8 (D105, symmetric blocks dim 14+14), within-block dominates (XOR6: within=2940 vs cross=532). Crossover regime between dim 5 and dim 14. Named by analogy: simple knots need connections (edges) for computational fabric; complex knots are self-sufficient (nodes).
- D105 8-strand XOR revival: D93's "XOR dies at N>=7" is REFUTED as a k-regime artifact. W_{8,0} at k=4096 produces XOR8=22266, beating n=6's 21699 at matched k. The ratio k/2^N is the real control parameter. Growth rate for B_8 is ~7x (14 generators), confirming the sl_d thesis at a fourth strand count (3->2x, 4->3.1x, 5->4x, 6->5x, 8->~7x).
- D105 rank saturation methodology (ESTABLISHED): single-checkpoint rank measurements are unreliable for infinite braid groups. Must report saturation curves at multiple checkpoints. Retroactive analysis shows W_{8,0} at 32768 entries: raw=710/784 (90.6%), sign=767/784 (97.8%). W_{8,2} at 16384 entries: raw=1096/3136 (34.9%), sign=2003/3136 (63.9%), sign expansion 1.83x and still growing. All prior cross-module rank comparisons were confounded by varying oversampling ratios.
- D107 Z/4Z Axis-Alignment Theorem (PROVEN): every entry of a braid representation matrix over a TL module at delta=0 is axis-aligned (exactly one nonzero cyclotomic component). Proof chain: (1) TL generators have {0,1} entries, (2) braid generators give entries from {0, A, A^{-1}}, (3) axis-aligned * axis-aligned = axis-aligned, (4) same-axis addition preserves axis, (5) bipartiteness of TL link-state graphs ensures only same-axis values are added at each matrix position. This upgrades the axiality result from empirical (D35) to proven.
- D107 Nesting Parity Z/2Z Grading (NOVEL THEOREM): the bipartite 2-coloring of TL link-state transition graphs IS nesting count mod 2. Verified for ALL n=2,3,4,5,6 (195 matchings, 0 mismatches). Researcher confirmed this is NOT a consequence of the known KLR Z-grading (Plaza-Ryom-Hansen 2013) -- it is a genuinely novel algebraic structure on TL modules.
- D107 constructive Z/4Z phase formula: Entry(r,c) = (integer path count) * zeta_8^{(w - 2*(nest(r) + nest(c))) mod 4}. Three numbers (writhe, nesting of source state, nesting of target state) fully determine the cyclotomic phase. This reduces DKC at delta=0 to integer path counting + phase lookup: effective computation is Z x Z/4Z per matrix entry.
- D107 Major Index Bipartite Invariant (CONJECTURED for general n,j): for TL standard modules W_{n,j}, the bipartite invariant is maj mod 2 = sum of right-endpoint positions of arcs, mod 2. Verified at W_{4,2} (3/3) and W_{6,2} (9/9 -- the ONLY winning candidate out of 4 tested). For full matchings (j=0), maj mod 2 = nest mod 2 (special case).
- D107 q-Catalan Identity (PROVEN algebraically): C_{2m+1}(-1) = (-1)^m * C_m. Gives exact bipartition class sizes for W_{n,0} modules. Verified against all 5 data points (n=2,3,4,5,6).
- D107 Orthogonality Theorem: multiplicative quotient graph on 186 distinct Z[zeta_8] values = K_5 (Z/4Z multiplication table, complete 4-regular), additive quotient graph = star tree centered on 0 (axis-preserving). Multiplication = Z/4Z rotation across axes; addition = growth within each axis.

**Open questions specific to this lens:**
- The Galois symmetry conjecture: does the sandwich duality (top isomorphic to bottom) correspond to a Galois automorphism of Gal(Q(zeta_8)/Q)?
- Palindromic sector rank conjecture for even ell.
- ell=7 predictions: first cubic number field case, would validate all universal formulas. **CONFIRMED (D60).**
- ~~Is there a generator construction that reaches E₆ (binary tetrahedral) and E₈ (binary icosahedral)?~~ E₈ (binary icosahedral, 2I) reached in D94 via direct construction with generators s = (1+i+j+k)/2 and t = (phi + phi_inv*i + j)/2. E₆ (binary tetrahedral) remains open.
- Power-of-two finiteness conjecture: are the finite cases exactly angles π/2^k for k ≥ 1? ζ₃₂ (θ = π/16) is the next untested prediction.

**New results (D93, D94):**
- D93 complement-blindness theorem: combined_cell's |qa| normalization identifies S with -S, killing all non-complement-invariant functions under 1wpi encoding. Phase_cell (no sign flip) recovers all 13 NPN classes. The complement-blindness is a representation-theoretic constraint arising from the quaternionic S → -S symmetry in the half-sphere identification.
- D94 binary icosahedral group (2I, E₈, order 120): constructed via Z[sqrt5] exact arithmetic. 9 conjugacy classes, 31 distinct S² directions (vs 13 for z8). BFS closure in 7 rounds with symmetric diamond depth profile (5,8,11,12,11,8,4,1). The unique non-solvable finite SU(2) subgroup — the ADE classification endpoint. At matched catalog size, 2I outperforms solvable z8, confirming Barrington's theorem prediction. The E₈ lattice (icosian ring) connects 2I to the densest lattice packing in 8 dimensions.

**New results (D95-D97, D99-D101):**
- D95 derived series of z8: 24 > 12 > 4 > 1, corresponding exactly to the ADE chain 2O > 2T > Q8 > {±1} (E₇ > E₆ > D₄ > A₁). First direct computation of this group-theoretic partition in the DKC context. Cross-layer synergy: neither COMM (12 entries, 2T) nor NON-COMM (12 entries, coset) carries disproportionate capacity; the 2.7x boost from ALL(24) over either 12-element subset demonstrates cross-stratum interference. The 2I comparison shows perfect groups avoid stratification overhead entirely (60/60 are commutators).
- D96 two independent stratifications: D84's null/non-null and D95's derived series are independent, confirmed by cross-tabulation and connected to the character table of 2O (Kirillov-Ostrik 2002, 8 conjugacy classes). The 5-cell landscape maps onto E₇ Dynkin diagram structure through representation-theoretic (TL radical) and group-theoretic (derived series) pathways that are independent at the element level but unified at the categorical level.
- D97 octahedral geometry of Cell B: the 6 D0-nonnull entries form a regular octahedron on S² (the dual of the cube, one of the 24-cell's constituent polytopes). The lever arm mechanism -- nonzero real component enables phase_cell discrimination -- connects quaternion geometry to computational readout.
- D99 Delta_1 standard module: 2x2 indecomposable over Z[zeta_8] with non-split extension Ext^1(L(0), L(1)). Jordan block proves infinite braid group image despite TL_3 semisimplicity (n=3 odd, D51). Super-hub commutator has strong sl_2 bracket structure (Cartan L1=84). All entries have unit determinant -- representation is in SL_2(Z[zeta_8]).
- D100 W_{4,2} non-semisimple standard module: radical dim=9, Loewy length 3, extension 0→L_{4,4}→W_{4,2}→L_{4,2}→0. Radical direction r=(1,0,-1) preserved at all depths (constant radical content). Hub commutators annihilate the radical -- live in the semisimple quotient.
- D101 W_{5,3} simple standard module: no radical (n=5 odd), 4-dimensional. Demonstrates that DKC computes even on simple modules, but with strictly less deep capacity (XOR14=0) than non-semisimple modules (D100's XOR14=70). All three hubs mutually commute (zero matrix commutators) -- live in a commutative subalgebra.

**New results (D66, D69):**
- Quaternionic / SU(2) representation of braids: D66 proves that the SU(2) braid representation with generators σ₁ → (1+i)/√2, σ₂ → (1−k)/√2 maps the braid group to exactly the 24 vertices of the 24-cell (binary octahedral group, 48 elements with negatives). This is a direct representation-theoretic object sitting above the scalar bracket.
- The bracket is the trace of this SU(2) representation after Markov normalization. The 24-cell is the image of the braid group under the quaternionic representation, explaining why the bracket catalog has 100 values but only 24 underlying quaternionic states.
- D69 proves the Direction Nesting Theorem: for any N, all SU(2) eigenvector directions in the ζ_N catalog appear identically in the ζ_{2N} catalog. Algebraic proof: squaring a quaternion preserves its rotation axis. Computationally verified ζ_8 → ζ_16 at 13/13 directions with 0.000° angular drift.
- D71 connects the representation space to spectral theory: the 13 eigenvector directions of the binary octahedral group are a spectral basis for spherical harmonics up to l=6 on S². The 13=13 theorem (2l+1=13 at l=6) is a representation-theoretic fact about the binary octahedral group's direction count.

**New results (D80):**
- ADE classification confirmed computationally: ζ₄ generates the binary dihedral group 2D₂ (order 8, D-series in ADE), and ζ₈ generates the binary octahedral group 2O (order 48, E₇ in ADE). These are the only two finite groups reachable under the two-perpendicular-axes generator construction.
- The quantum dimension [2]_q = q + q⁻¹ = i + (−i) = 0 at ζ₈ (q = i): ζ₈ is the most singular point in quantum group parameter space — the one finite exceptional case where the quantum dimension vanishes entirely.
- The non-monotone finiteness boundary (ζ₄ finite, ζ₆ infinite, ζ₈ finite, all others infinite) shows that algebraic degree of cos(π/N) does not predict finiteness. The finite cases are exactly the angles that are symmetries of the cube/octahedron.
- E₆ (binary tetrahedral) and E₈ (binary icosahedral) are not reachable under the tested generator construction; the ADE exhaustion for the DKC construction stops at E₇.
- D74 incomparability theorem: the DKC Voronoi cell and the Kauffman bracket are incomparable braid invariants — neither subsumes the other. At the braid level, 97.8% of bracket collisions are separated by cell; at the catalog level, 80% are separated. The combination yields 119 equivalence classes vs 100 bracket-alone and 14 cell-alone (+19% finer). Six distinct computational type vectors capture the DKC orbit structure.
- D73 additive-not-multiplicative: the multiplicative braid product formulation (using the braid as a group element) is structurally incapable of computing XOR6. The complement-all-bits map sends M → M⁻¹ which shares the same eigenvector cell, making parity invisible. The additive weight sum formulation computes XOR6 at 82.8% universal determinism — a structural constant identical across all 36 winning triples, following from the binary octahedral group acting transitively on the 13 directions.

**New results (D83, D84):**
- D83 Jones normalization as framing information loss: Jones normalization removes the writhe-dependent phase factor (−A³)^{−w}, stripping exactly the framing information that distinguishes the bracket from the Jones polynomial. From the representation-theory perspective, this is removal of a character-valued class function on the braid group: the writhe phase is a 1-dimensional representation (the abelianization of the braid group), and its removal collapses the writh-graded module structure. Jones XOR capacity = bracket XOR capacity − 2 at every tested root — the 2-level loss is the dimension of the writhe grading discarded.
- D84 non-semisimplicity as the computational resource: at ζ₄ (semisimple TL algebra, [2]_q = ±2), the catalog has 4 entries of which 3 are bracket-null — 75% null fraction and only XOR6 capacity. The semisimple case has nearly trivial structure. At ζ₈ (non-semisimple, [2]_q = 0), 37.5% null fraction and XOR8 capacity — the radical and its null states are not dead weight but the computational resource. The LCFT interpretation: bracket-null entries (Re(q) = 0) are the analogs of LCFT null states — zero two-point function but nonzero vectors. Their logarithmic partners (non-null entries on the same S² direction, the 3 shared coordinate-axis directions) carry computational content through the Jordan-cell coupling. The 6 null-only directions (cube-edge-midpoints) have no logarithmic partner — removing them (by removing the null entries) collapses XOR capacity from 8 to 6. Non-semisimplicity creates the Jordan-cell structure; Jordan cells are the mechanism of the null-state computational contribution.

**New results (D85, D86):**
- D85 indecomposability parameter b = -5/8 computed from first principles: the Pearce-Rasmussen indecomposability parameter for dense polymers at delta=0 is computed exactly at TL_4 via leading-coefficient extraction from the delta-parameterized Markov trace on the full 14-dimensional regular representation. b_delta = -5/2 on the regular rep; normalizing by dim(0-TL sector) = 4 gives b_PR = -5/8, exact to 12 decimal places. The "controversy" between b = -2 (GRS quantum group convention) and b = -5/8 (PR lattice convention) dissolves: both are correct under different normalization.
- D85 standard modules are fully diagonalizable: the Hamiltonian H on the standard module W_{n,0} (link states) has NO Jordan blocks at any tested size (n=4,6,8,10,12). The minimal polynomial is square-free at every size. Jordan blocks exist exclusively on projective covers P_{0,0} and the full regular representation. This falsifies claims that b is extracted from standard module Jordan structure — the non-semisimple structure is confined to the projective cover level.
- D85 projective cover P_{0,0} Jordan blocks at nonzero eigenvalues: TL_4 P_{0,0} (dim=5, composition 0-TL:2 + 2-TL:3) has Jordan blocks at lambda = +/-sqrt(2), not at lambda = 0. The characteristic polynomial x(x^2-2)^2 reveals the non-semisimple structure. P_{0,0} dimensions follow the next-Catalan pattern: C_3=5 at TL_4, C_4=14 at TL_6, C_5=42 at TL_8.
- D85 valuation condition and TL_6 divergence: the leading-coefficient method requires p_tt = 2*p_Tt (minimum delta-powers in the bilinear forms). At TL_4 this is satisfied (2 = 2*1); at TL_6 it fails (4 != 6), causing b to diverge as delta^{-2}. The 25-fold multiplicity (dim(0-TL for TL_6)^2 = 25) introduces cross-copy interference that violates the valuation balance.
- D85 fixed-point form gauge analysis: the fixpt-trace bilinear form at TL_4 has 3-dimensional gauge freedom with a purely affine b landscape (M=0, E=0). Both -2 and -5/8 are reachable points on this flat manifold. The delta-parameterized Markov trace form breaks the degeneracy and selects b = -5/8.
- D86 universal divergence on single P_{0,0}: the delta-parameterized Gram matrix approach diverges on every single projective cover at every eigenvalue and every lattice size tested. The multiplicity from the regular representation is structurally essential — not a removable scale factor but a participant in the valuation balance. This is a novel negative finding: nobody in the literature has tried this specific approach.
- D86 TL_8 P_{0,0} is completely semisimple: no Jordan blocks at lambda=0 on the dim-42 projective cover. The non-semisimple structure enabling b computation does not persist at this lattice size on P_{0,0} alone. There may be a parity/periodicity pattern in which sizes carry non-semisimple structure at the projective cover level.

**Connections to other lenses:**
- To Coding Theory: the radical is what the bracket evaluation quotients out. The semisimple quotient TL/rad is the "visible" part; the radical is the "invisible" lattice dimension. This is exactly the information-theoretic partition into accessible and inaccessible bits.
- To Quantum Mechanics: the radical corresponds to decoherence. The decoherence rate scaling ((2ell-3)/C_ell decreasing with ell) is WHY Fibonacci anyons (ell=5, 17% radical) are better for quantum computing than Ising anyons (ell=4, 36%). The SU(2) quaternionic representation (D66) lives between the abstract TL representation and the scalar bracket trace. D85's b = -5/8 connects to LCFT structure constants — the indecomposability parameter is the coupling between the logarithmic partner and the primary field in the c=-2 dense polymer LCFT, and its exact computation from the TL algebra confirms the algebraic origin of LCFT structure constants.
- To Approximation Theory: the quantum dimensions [n]_q satisfy the Chebyshev recurrence. The Jones-Wenzl idempotents ARE Chebyshev polynomials evaluated on TL generators. The radical appears precisely where the Chebyshev polynomial vanishes. The 13 eigenvector directions of the binary octahedral group provide the DOF count that sets the l=6 bandwidth minimum (D71).

## Lens 2: Coding Theory

**What the research looks like:** The bracket catalog is a codebook. Z[zeta_8] is a rank-4 lattice over Z, and each bracket value is a codeword. The question "which Boolean functions can be computed?" becomes "which truth tables are achievable via lattice codewords as neural network weights?" This is Nazer-Gastpar's compute-and-forward applied not to relay channels but to topological invariants.

**Central demos:** D29 (forward DKC -- exact Z[zeta_8] arithmetic, 65K+ XOR triples from lattice), D48 (100M quartet exhaustive search -- the parity wall as a coding-theoretic impossibility), D63 (parity ceiling n=5, oriented matroid classification), D46 (capacity analysis: ~4.3 bits magnitude + ~1.5 bits phase = ~5.8 bits/symbol), D47 (two-channel coding conjecture, topology-frequency correlation reversal), D12 (quantization geometry, BitNet parallels), D103-D104 (sign-rank expansion, 1-bit compressed sensing, branching interaction, Atkinson sweet spot), D108 (Dual-Channel Theorem -- product closure predicts parity capability).

**Core results belonging to this lens:**
- Axiality theorem: at delta=0, bracket values are Z-axial in Z[zeta_8] -- only one coordinate is nonzero. The full rank-4 lattice collapses to rank 1. This is extreme constellation collapse.
- Axiality hierarchy: ell=2 is Z-axial (1D), ell=3 is Z[zeta_6]-axial (1D), ell=4 is Z[i]-axial (2D), ell=5 is full Z[zeta_5] (4D). Richer rings enable richer codebooks.
- Phase decoherence thesis (D46): split-sigmoid accesses ~4.3 bits (magnitude channel), MVN-continuous accesses a different ~1.5 bits (phase channel). These are literally complementary codes.
- Catalog size hierarchy: ell=3 (6 values, binary collapse), ell=4 (56 values), delta=0 (100 values), ell=5 (116 values). Non-monotonic: delta=0 has a uniquely favorable catalog despite the simplest algebra.
- The 11/13 half-plane theorem (D61-62): a semicircular decision region on additive angular sums can reach exactly 11 of 13 NPN classes. This is a covering radius / quantization geometry result.
- Parity ceiling for Z[zeta_8] is n=5 -- the fundamental capacity limit of the Z[zeta_8] codebook for the hardest boolean function.
- Oriented matroid classification: alternating OM type required for parity. Connection to matroid theory codebook structure.
- Matroid minor chain structure (D64): the XOR hierarchy {XOR2, XOR3, XOR4, XOR5} is deletion-contraction closed (deleting a weight gives XOR_{n-1}, contracting an input gives XNOR_{n-1}). This is a legitimate matroid minor chain.
- Vocabulary stratification (D64): of 83 class-1 catalog values at k=15, exactly 44 are "good" (appear in extensible XOR4 solutions) and 31 are "poison" (appear only in orphan XOR4 solutions). The 44 good values are strictly nested: they are exactly the values appearing in XOR5 solutions. Poison values span octants {1,2,3,5,6,7} but not octant 4.
- Algebra-independence of the parity ceiling (D65): the Z[zeta_16] catalog has different catalog values (36 vs 100 at delta=0) but identical tier thresholds: XOR3 at k=6, XOR4 at k=8, XOR5 at k=14. Parity ceiling n=5 is unchanged. This refutes the "gap-of-2" hypothesis — the gap widens to 9 at Z[zeta_16]. The ceiling is not a property of the ring.
- Self-doubling impossibility theorem (D64): adding a 6th weight equal to any existing weight always fails because scalar doubling preserves the angle of a Z[zeta_8] value, and a class-1 value doubled remains class-1, making an even-parity output class-1 when it must be class-0. Accounts for 89.5% of closest misses at Hamming distance 4.

**New results (D72, D73, D74, D81, D82):**
- D72 compressed sensing vs t-design (DOF-not-sampling): the 13 eigenvector directions fail the spherical t-design property entirely (t=0, worst possible) yet stochastic optimization shows better-distributed directions give fewer XOR6 solutions (36 vs 4). Sampling quality and computational quality are anti-correlated. The reason DKC works at bandwidth l=6 with 13 directions is the DOF coincidence 2×6+1=13 combined with compressed sensing for binary functions at known support positions — not uniform sampling.
- D73 additive-not-multiplicative confirmed: DKC is fundamentally an additive lattice computation. 82.8% of cell transitions are deterministic — a universal structural constant across all 36 winning triples that follows from binary octahedral group transitivity. The multiplicative (group product) formulation has zero XOR6 solutions because parity is invisible to it.
- D74 vocabulary stratification refined: the combined (bracket, cell) invariant gives 119 equivalence classes — 19% finer than bracket alone. The 6 computational type vectors partition cells into orbit-equivalent roles under the binary octahedral symmetry. The incomparability of bracket and cell channels is computationally load-bearing (confirmed by D77: neither channel alone can compute XOR8, but their product can).
- D81 logarithmic scaling law: for ζ₁₂ (infinite group), max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog_size) + 4.6. Each +2 XOR inputs costs approximately 10× more catalog entries. Transition points: XOR8 at ~51 entries, XOR10 at ~275, XOR12 at ~1140. Direction count is the bottleneck: 22 dirs needed for XOR8, 114 for XOR10, 507 for XOR12.
- D82 depth as crossing complexity → Kuperberg #P-hardness connection: the logarithmic law of D81 is a corollary of a linear depth law (max_xor ≈ depth + 6) combined with exponential catalog growth per depth. Since catalog grows as ~2^depth, log₂(catalog) ≈ depth, giving the log scaling. The hardness of generating deep entries (exponential BFS cost) at non-lattice roots is exactly what Kuperberg's #P-hardness theorem predicts — the computational gain is linear in crossing depth while the cost of generating those crossings is exponential. Algebraic coherence beats raw vocabulary: deep entries with fewer directions/angles outperform broad, uniform entries.

**New results (D83, D84):**
- D83 additive resource decomposition (lattice + depth + writhe = total capacity): the framing test establishes that three coding channels are independently additive. Lattice structure alone provides XOR6; each crossing-depth unit adds +2 (D82); writhe (framing) adds another +2 on top, for a total of lattice + 2×depth_rounds + 2×framing_present. The channels are confirmed independent by the depth-writhe correlation r = 0.139 across 4096 entries — nearly orthogonal. This is a clean additive capacity formula across three independent information channels, directly analogous to independent code layers.
- D83 Jones normalization as angular vocabulary reduction: Jones normalization reduces distinct angles from 43 to 31 (−28%) while leaving direction count unchanged (512 → 512). The capacity loss is entirely angular, not directional — it is a channel-specific erasure. Framing information lives in the S¹ angle coordinate, not the S² direction coordinate.
- D84 null entries as effective-rank conditioning: the 9 bracket-null entries in the ζ₈ catalog cover 6 cube-edge-midpoint directions unavailable to the 15 non-null entries. Removing nulls drops XOR capacity from 8 to 6, which is worse than removing a random 9-entry subset (random mean 7.8 vs null-removed 6.0). The null entries are conditioning the weight space: they maximize the effective rank of the 13-direction S² vocabulary by populating the 6 directions that non-null entries cannot reach. Removing them is not just losing 9 entries — it is collapsing the rank of the directional codebook from 13 to 7. The 3× resolution penalty (k=6 → k=16–20) observed when nulls are removed in the k_sec sweep corresponds to a Cramér-Rao cost of operating from an ill-conditioned basis.

**New results (D89, D90, D91, D92):**
- D89-D91 depth law mechanism arc: the depth law (max_xor ~ depth + 6) is now explained as the balanced exponentials principle — BFS vocabulary grows ~2x per depth round while parity demand grows 4x per weight level, yielding ~2 depth rounds per additional XOR weight, hence linear slope ~1. Five candidate mechanisms killed (pairwise coherence, direction coverage, Cayley density, sector saturation, angle coherence). The actual mechanism is axis cancellation (anti-aligned rotation axes producing low sum angles) combined with cross-depth algebraic constraints (BFS ancestry limiting sum-angle vocabularies). D91 confirms the wall is parity itself, not activation resolution: max_xor is invariant across all k_sec (2-48) and all Voronoi direction counts (2-114). Resolution affects winner count, not existence.
- D89 paired extension as minority pathway at infinite groups: at ζ₁₂ (4096 entries, 2043 dirs), shadow pairing constitutes only 6% of XOR6 winners and 20% of XOR8 winners. At ζ₈ (24 entries, 13 dirs) it was 100%. The coding strategy shifts from shadow pairing (direction-scarce regime) to direction diversity (direction-rich regime). Both pathways depend on the same underlying algebra; the dominant one is determined by vocabulary size.
- D92 parity-lock theorem (PROVED): the ±q input encoding creates 3^k equivalence classes per k weights. XOR/XNOR are the ONLY standard Boolean functions constant on all classes. The (0,0) equiv (1,1) collision — masks 0...0 and 1...1 always produce identical zero sums — makes any f where f(0...0) != f(1...1) impossible under ANY activation. AND, OR, MAJ, THRESHOLD all have f(0...0) != f(1...1) and produce ZERO winners at every depth (verified depths 0-8, both 6- and 8-input). The depth law is parity-specific, not function-general.
- D92 encoding concentrates on hardest function: the ±q paired encoding channels all computational power into parity — the single Boolean function outside AC^0 (Furst-Saxe-Sipser/Hastad). This is a coding-theoretic result about the encoding's equivalence class structure: the sign-flip symmetry (combined_cell(S) = combined_cell(-S)) creates a second parity-lock mechanism that collapses 27 classes to at most 14 distinguishable groups.
- D92 mask collision structure: 76 exact quaternion-sum collisions among C(64,2)=2016 mask pairs; ALL 76 are same-parity (0 cross-parity collisions). Same-parity collisions preserve XOR separability but break non-XOR functions that need to distinguish same-parity masks.

**New results (D95-D101):**
- D96 optimal catalog pruning: removing 3 Q8-null entries from the 24-entry z8 catalog IMPROVES XOR capacity at every N. A+B+C (21 entries) beats ALL (24): 74.06% vs 71.94% (N=3). Quality over quantity -- the first demonstration that removing entries from a DKC codebook can improve coding capacity. This is a design rule: prune bracket-null entries in deep derived subgroups.
- D96 cross-derived synergy principle: B+C (non-null from different derived levels) dominates all 6 pairwise combinations at every N. The null/non-null boundary matters more than the derived level boundary -- this is a coding-theoretic ordering of which partition carries more information for XOR separation.
- D98 readout bottleneck as information loss: trace retains 5.1% of 3-strand information (105 distinct values from 2048 matrices). Column-4 retains 100% (2048 distinct vectors, 20 integer DOFs). The trace is a lossy channel -- a coding-theoretic observation about readout function selection.
- D99 16-component sign-pattern activation (2x2_hash): the 2x2 matrix over Z[zeta_8] has 16 integer components. The sign pattern (pos/zero/neg for each) provides up to 3^16 = ~43M cells. This is a novel discrete codebook activation function for matrix-valued DKC, far richer than the 8-cell trace octant.
- D99 XOR14 = 60 at deep entries: the 3-strand Delta_1 module achieves XOR14 from deep entries (d>=6), extending the DKC capacity frontier well beyond 2-strand's XOR12 (Cell B). Capacity saturates by ~4096 entries -- the codebook size is not the bottleneck; activation resolution and search depth are.
- D100-D101 sl_d growth rate as codebook growth: BFS growth ~3.1x (4-strand) and ~4x (5-strand) per round determines how quickly the codebook expands. The rate tracks n-1 (number of TL generators minus 1), a clean prediction for codebook expansion rate at arbitrary strand count.
- D101 broader shallow capacity in simple modules: W_{5,3} (simple) has MORE XOR6-8 solutions than W_{4,2} (non-semisimple) but FEWER XOR10-14 solutions. The coding implication: simple modules are better codebooks for low-arity functions but worse for high-arity functions.

**New results (D103, D104, D108):**
- D103 curse of dimensionality in sign-hash activation (CONFIRMED): higher-dimensional modules produce WORSE XOR capacity at matched k despite identical BFS trees. W_{6,0} (dim=5, 100 sign components) beats W_{6,2} (dim=9, 324 sign components) at every XOR level: XOR6 2449 vs 2238, XOR8 850 vs 557, XOR10 1 vs 0. More sign components creates a SPARSER hash space, reducing collision-based XOR capacity. However, subset-hash experiments reveal the deficit is an activation artifact: B@sub7 (196 components from the 9x9 matrix) achieves XOR6=2538, BEATING A@full. Activation geometry matters, not just component count.
- D103 BFS growth is a braid group invariant: W_{6,0} (dim=5) and W_{6,2} (dim=9) produce bit-for-bit IDENTICAL BFS depth profiles and max coefficient magnitudes. This eliminates the dim(W) law hypothesis -- growth rate tracks strand count (n-1=5), not module dimension. Combined with D102, all three tested n=6 modules have identical BFS trees.
- D104 sign-rank expansion (NEW FINDING): sign quantization (ternary {-1,0,+1} projection) can INCREASE effective rank. W_{6,2}: raw rank 244/324 (75.3%), sign-rank 292/324 (90.1%) -- a gain of 48 independent directions. The nonlinear sign() function breaks linear dependencies that exist over Z. W_{6,0}: raw/sign rank both 100/100 (already maximally independent). This is a coding-theoretic observation: 1-bit compressed sensing measurement through sign() is an information EXPANDER, not just a lossy quantizer.
- D104 Atkinson sweet spot (DEMONSTRATED): for W_{6,2} at k=128, optimal component count is ~120 (of 324 total), producing XOR6=2486 which beats W_{6,0}'s maximum 2449. Non-monotonic component curve: rises to 120, drops through 150-250, partial recovery at 300. Named after Atkinson dithering -- optimal information-per-collision tradeoff in sign-hash quantization. The peak is k-dependent (at higher k, more components usable).
- D104 branching interaction IS the computational signal (CONFIRMED): W_{6,2} decomposes under TL_5 restriction into through-strand (rows 0-4) and arc-bound (rows 5-8) pieces. Cross-block activation (160 comp) outperforms within-block (164 comp) at XOR6 (2412 vs 2235) and dramatically at XOR8 (952 vs omitted). The branching cross-terms between TL_5 sub-pieces have low intra-block coherence -- the 1-bit compressed sensing incoherence condition.
- D104 k is the real lever (DEMONSTRATED, partially refutes D103): multi-hash architecture does NOT improve XOR capacity. Increasing k (cell count) is the primary scaling lever. Cross-block advantage at k=128 vanishes at k=4096 where W_{6,0} wins at every k value. The coding implication: hash architecture is secondary to codebook resolution.
- D108 Dual-Channel Theorem (NOVEL, CENTRAL CLAIM): parity capability requires BOTH multiplicative phase coherence (product closure > 0) AND additive magnitude diversity (v_2 connectivity > trivial). Parity vocabulary (41 values) has 17 product closure edges forming connected P_3 path; poison vocabulary (17 values) has ZERO product closure edges (empty graph). Maximum structural contrast on the multiplicative channel. Additive v_2 quotient: parity connects 5/6 classes (83%), poison connects 2/6 (trivial K_2). The two channels measure genuinely different algebraic properties (phase rotation vs magnitude reach) and both are independently necessary.
- D108 partition coincidence as incapacity signature: poison values show triple partition collapse (root = Galois = norm, all 15 groups). Zero internal algebraic differentiation. Parity has three distinct partition levels (root/norm at 21, Galois at 37, v_2 at 5). Algebraic sameness IS computational death.
- D108 resolution dependence of computational role: 14 values are simultaneously parity-capable (k=6) and D64-poison (k=15). Computational role depends on sector resolution, not intrinsic value properties. This connects the coding picture to the approximation picture: the same codeword plays different roles at different quantization levels.
- D108 Amy Bridge (T-gate/Hadamard analogy): DKC's dual-channel structure maps onto Amy, Glaudell & Ross (2023) quantum circuit synthesis. Product closure = T-gate (phase channel), activation-induced magnitude diversity = Hadamard (magnitude channel). The activation function provides Hadamard-equivalent resources enabling sde=0 values to compute parity.

**Open questions specific to this lens:**
- Two-channel coding conjecture: can a joint decoder for magnitude + phase achieve ~5.8 bits/symbol?
- Does the catalog size obey a lattice theta function identity?
- What is the covering radius of the Z[zeta_8] bracket catalog in the complex plane?
- CSS feasibility is already ruled out (radical is self-orthogonal under Gram form but not standard inner product). Are there other algebraic coding constructions that work?
- Z[zeta_16] scaling: does moving to ell=3 (rank-8 lattice) push the parity ceiling beyond n=5? What is the general relationship between cyclotomic ring rank and parity capacity? **ANSWERED (D65): ceiling stays at n=5; the ceiling is algebra-independent.**
- Are the 44 good values and 31 poison values related to the matroid structure of mu_8 (Reiner's cyclotomic matroid at 8th roots of unity)?
- Is the 0.62 XOR-per-doubling constant specific to ζ₁₂, or does it depend on the root of unity? Does ζ₁₀ (more half-angles per entry) give a steeper slope?
- What algebraic property do deep entries possess that makes them computationally superior to vocabulary-equivalent shallow entries? Can this be characterized as a structured code property? **ANSWERED (D90): axis cancellation + cross-depth algebraic constraint. Deep entries have anti-aligned rotation axes enabling partial cancellation; BFS ancestry constrains pairwise sum-angle vocabularies.**
- Can encodings be constructed that target specific Boolean functions other than parity? The parity-lock theorem (D92) identifies the structural mechanism; can it be exploited to engineer encodings for AND, OR, or MAJ?
- Is the ±q encoding provably optimal for parity among all 2-bit-per-weight encodings?

**Connections to other lenses:**
- To Representation Theory: the radical is the "invisible" sublattice. Bracket evaluation projects through TL/rad, killing radical codewords. The neglecton weights (D49) are first-order perturbations recovering radical information -- 148 new values, but zero new angles. The lattice geometry is preserved by the projection.
- To Quantum Mechanics: the bracket value IS a Chern-Simons amplitude (Costello-Francis-Gwilliam 2026 proved Witten = RT). So the codebook is literally a table of quantum transition amplitudes. The ζ_8 evaluation point places the T-gate (Clifford hierarchy level 3) at the center of the codebook: self-doubling in Z[zeta_8] corresponds to the T→S gate descent, which is precisely why the wall occurs at n=6.
- To Approximation Theory: the 11/13 theorem is fundamentally about angular geometry. The proof that 0x1B and 0x06 are unreachable uses semicircle bounds -- the activation boundary is a half-plane, and certain truth tables require weight angles that cannot simultaneously satisfy the angular constraints. This is polynomial approximation theory on the circle. The matroid minor chain structure (D64) gives a combinatorial counterpart: the 44-good / 31-poison vocabulary split is a matroid independence constraint on the codebook.

## Lens 3: Quantum Mechanics

**What the research looks like:** The Kauffman bracket is the amplitude for a Chern-Simons path integral. Braid words are worldlines of anyons. The Yang-Baxter equation is the consistency condition for particle scattering. Evaluating the bracket at a root of unity selects a topological quantum field theory at a specific level. The DKC construction compiles quantum amplitudes into classical Boolean logic.

**Central demos:** D03-D05 (TL modules, R-matrix, Yang-Baxter equation, quantum trace formula), D04 (Schur-Weyl duality decomposition V^{tensor 3} = V_{3/2} tensor W_3 + V_{1/2} tensor W_1), D18-D19 (braid logic gates -- NOT + NAND = computational universality from topological amplitudes), D20 (delta error landscape -- |delta| = 2|cos(2theta)| as universal gate viability predictor), D09 (Reidemeister invariance -- the bracket IS a topological invariant), D106 (topological entropy null -- TL visibility filter, relational computation thesis), D107 (axis-alignment proof as quantum constraint, DKC reduces to integer path counting + Z/4Z phase).

**Core results belonging to this lens:**
- Quantum trace formula: bracket(beta) = tr_q(rho(beta)) / (A^2 + A^{-2}) with (-1)^n sign factor. Verified n=2 through n=5.
- Braid computational universality: specific braid words compute NOT (2 strands, 6 crossings) and NAND (3 strands, 5 crossings). NOT + NAND = Turing complete.
- Delta error landscape: |delta| = 2|cos(2theta)| cleanly separates universal-computation angles from NOT-only angles. Delta-zero angles (8th roots of unity) are where braid circuits compute exact Boolean logic.
- Entanglement vanishing theorem: at delta=0, ALL non-interleaving braids have zero bracket. Delta=0 is an entanglement detector.
- Convergence at WRT angles (D15): the greedy-optimal classification angle (1.805pi) converges to within 1.5% of the WRT level-3 evaluation point (11pi/6). "Topology knows information theory."
- Fibonacci anyon negative result (D58): at ell=5, braid representations are dense in PSU(2) — the condition for topological quantum computation universality. But density in the group does NOT translate to angular diversity in the scalar bracket output. The bracket projects a rich group-theoretic structure down to scalar amplitudes, and the projection destroys the angular diversity that DKC needs. This is why TQC universality and DKC universality are independent properties.
- DKC-RT truncation connection (D63): DKC works because it uses pre-closure bracket information that RT truncation would discard. At delta=0 (ell=2), the most degenerate topological point gives the most structured algebraic point.
- Clifford hierarchy connection (D64): the ring Z[zeta_8] is the algebraic ring of the T-gate (Clifford hierarchy level 3). The self-doubling impossibility in Z[zeta_8] corresponds to the T→S gate descent: doubling a T-gate weight produces an S-gate weight, which is at a lower hierarchy level and is class-1 in any odd sector. This is the precise mechanism of the n=6 wall.
- Algebra-independence of the ceiling (D65): the parity ceiling n=5 is invariant across Z[zeta_8] and Z[zeta_16], suggesting it is a statement about topological state sums, not evaluation algebra. The Clifford hierarchy level of the evaluation point does not determine the parity capacity.
- Hopf fibration structure (D66-D67): the braid group's SU(2) representation maps into the 24-cell sitting inside S³. Under the Hopf fibration S³ → S², all computational information lives in the S² base (the rotation axis direction). The S¹ Hopf fiber is completely computationally inert: phase-only activation yields zero XOR6 solutions at all resolutions tested. The S² base carries everything.
- Entanglement monogamy parallel (D64): the wall anatomy shows that 10 of C(6,2)=15 pairwise weight sums can simultaneously be assigned to even sectors, but all 15 cannot. This is structurally analogous to the CKW entanglement monogamy inequality: not all pairwise entanglement can be simultaneously maximized.
- Contextuality parallel (D64): the parity wall is a consistent-coloring obstruction — there is no assignment of class labels to all C(6,2)=15 weight pairs simultaneously satisfying the XOR6 truth table. This is formally analogous to the Kochen-Specker theorem.
- D71 connects the Hopf base to spectral theory: the 13 eigenvector directions of the binary octahedral group (the S² image of the braid group image) are the support points for a spherical harmonic expansion, and the minimum bandwidth l=6 comes from the counting identity 2l+1=13. Quantum angular momentum modes on the representation space explain the DKC bandwidth.

**New results (D75, D77, D80):**
- D80 quantum dimension [2]_q = 0 at ζ₈ (most singular point): q = i gives [2]_q = i + i⁻¹ = i − i = 0. The quantum dimension vanishes exactly at ζ₈, which is simultaneously the E₇ exceptional ADE point, the T-gate Clifford hierarchy ring Z[ζ_8], and the DKC sweet spot. Finite-group DKC requires the lattice (singular) points of quantum group parameter space — the non-lattice, non-singular points correspond to Kuperberg's #P-hard regime.
- D75 angle-subsumes-cell (Bloch sphere interpretation): for all 36 XOR6 winning triples, the eigenvalue angle of the sum quaternion perfectly predicts parity. The cell (S² eigenvector direction) is a coarsening of the eigenvalue angle (S¹). Seven discrete eigenvalue angles arise from the addition: {0°, 30°, 35.264°, 45°, 60°, 65.905°, 90°}. The three non-canonical angles (30°, 35.264°, 65.905°) arise only through quaternion addition breaking the 24-cell group structure — they are not present in individual catalog elements. The multiplicative channel, which stays inside the 24-cell group (only 4 canonical angles), has zero XOR6 solutions.
- D77 S¹ × S² as quaternionic generalization of MVN: the combined activation reads both eigenvalue angle (S¹) and eigenvector direction (S²) of the sum quaternion — the quaternionic generalization of Aizenberg's MVN which reads only the argument of a complex number (S¹). This product activation is structurally a Hopf fibration: the eigenvalue S¹ fiber and the eigenvector S² base decompose the unit quaternion as S³ → S². Neither channel alone can compute XOR8 (S² gives 0 winners, S¹ alone gives 0 winners), but the S¹ × S² product gives 6 winners at 100% accuracy. Demo 74's incomparability of bracket and cell channels is computationally load-bearing: incomparable invariants encode independent computational information.

**New results (D83, D84):**
- D83 TQFT anomaly as computational content (Witten 1989 maximally degenerate point): TQFT at δ=0 removes the writhe-dependent framing anomaly as its first normalization step. D83 demonstrates that what field theory discards for purity is exactly what DKC computes with. Jones normalization is a TQFT gauge choice — fixing the framing anomaly. The anomaly term contributes 2 XOR levels. This is the sharpest available statement of the Witten connection: the TQFT gauge-fixing operation has a measurable information cost in DKC terms, and the maximally degenerate point δ=0 is where that cost is most precisely isolatable.
- D84 LCFT logarithmic partners and Jordan-cell L₀ structure: bracket-null entries (Re(q)=0) are the DKC analog of LCFT null states — zero Kauffman trace (two-point function vanishes) but nonzero as vectors. The Jordan-cell structure of the Virasoro zero-mode L₀ in LCFT is mirrored by the bracket TL algebra acting on the ζ₈ catalog: null states (bracket-null entries) and logarithmic partners (non-null entries on the same S² direction) form 2×2 Jordan blocks. The 3 shared coordinate-axis directions correspond to null-partner pairs; the 6 null-only directions (cube-edge-midpoints) correspond to unpaired nulls whose logarithmic partners are absent from the catalog. Removing unpartnered null states collapses XOR capacity. The dense polymer model at β=0 (LCFT context) is the physical system where this Jordan-cell structure is natural — and δ=0 in the Kauffman bracket corresponds to exactly this β=0 polymer limit. Non-diagonalizability of L₀ is the algebraic signature of the non-semisimplicity that makes ζ₈ computationally exceptional.

**New results (D85, D87):**
- D85 b = -5/8 as LCFT structure constant: the indecomposability parameter for dense polymers at c=-2 is the logarithmic coupling in the LCFT L₀ Jordan cell: L₀|t> = |T> + b|T>. D85 computes this from the TL algebra (delta-parameterized Markov trace on the regular representation), confirming the algebraic origin of the LCFT structure constant. The value b = -5/8 is the per-cell (lattice/physical) normalization; b = -5/2 is the regular-representation value; the factor of 4 = dim(0-TL sector) connects the two. This places the D84 LCFT interpretation on quantitative footing: the Jordan-cell coupling that makes null states computationally indispensable has a specific, computable value.
- D85 valuation condition as LCFT regularity requirement: the leading-coefficient method requires p_tt = 2*p_Tt for b to converge. At TL_4 this is satisfied; at TL_6 it fails (cross-copy interference from dim(0-TL)^2 = 25 multiplicity). From the LCFT perspective, this is a regularity condition on the lattice realization of the continuum LCFT — only at TL_4 does the finite-lattice algebra perfectly mirror the continuum Jordan-cell structure. The divergence at TL_6 indicates that larger lattices require a different extraction method (likely transfer-matrix finite-size scaling as in the original PR approach).
- D87 regime transition for null-state physics: at ζ₁₂ (infinite group, 4096 entries), bracket-null entries are directionally indispensable (67 exclusive S² axes) but computationally dispensable (XOR capacity fully preserved without nulls). This is a regime transition from ζ₈ where removing nulls destroys capacity. The LCFT null-state interpretation (D84: null entries as Jordan-cell anchors critical for computation) is regime-dependent: it applies at finite groups (ζ₈, sparse directions, 37.5% null fraction) but not at infinite groups (ζ₁₂, dense directions, 3.0% null fraction). The null fraction dilution series — ζ₄: 75%, ζ₈: 37.5%, ζ₁₂: 3.0% — suggests nulls approach measure zero in the infinite-group limit. In the LCFT language, the Jordan-cell mechanism is a finite-group (non-semisimple, lattice-point) phenomenon; infinite groups have enough non-null directional diversity that the Jordan-cell contribution becomes redundant.

**New results (D95, D98-D101):**
- D95 solvability bottleneck via Barrington mechanism: the commutator structure of z8 (solvable, derived series 24>12>4>1) vs 2I (perfect, G1=G0=60) makes the Barrington prediction concrete. Cross-layer interaction is the mechanism: mixing algebraic strata generates computational capacity. 2I's perfection means every pair contributes commutator-quality interference with no stratification overhead.
- D98 entanglement vanishing at scale: confirmed Demo 35's result at 2048-entry scale -- all 31 non-interleaving 3-strand entries have zero bracket. Axiality (single nonzero Cyc8 component) extends from 2-strand to 3-strand, confirming the axiality constraint is structural.
- D99 Ext^1 as quantum resource: the non-split extension Ext^1(L(0),L(1)) in the restricted quantum group u_q(sl_2) at ell=2 parallels non-semisimple TQFT structure (Voss-Kim-Bhatt 2025): alpha-anyon anchor (quantum trace zero) + sigma-anyon qubits + semisimple readout. The analogy is structural: non-semisimplicity is catalytic preparation (like magic state distillation but reusable), computation happens in the semisimple layer. Winner matrices are 4.4x MORE diagonalizable than controls -- the semisimple property is the computation, the Jordan block is the infrastructure.
- D99 Property F failure: the braid group image through Delta_1 is INFINITE despite finite-dimensional representation, because Delta_1 is not a direct sum of simple modules. Property F (Freedman-Larsen-Wang) does not apply at delta=0.
- D100 Casimir as quantum complexity measure: C3(M) = 3*tr(M^2) - (tr M)^2 grows exponentially with BFS depth while radical content stays constant. Casimir measures deviation from scalar matrices -- a quantum-mechanical analog of "how far from a classical state." The correlation with XOR capacity (1.36x-1.86x) makes Casimir a quantitative measure of algebraic reservoir quality.
- D101 Casimir-XOR inversion as simple/non-semisimple diagnostic: in simple modules, harder XOR computations select for LOW-Casimir (near-scalar) entries, inverting the D100 pattern. Near-scalar entries in simple modules provide the stability role that the radical extension provides in non-semisimple modules. This is a new quantum-mechanical observable: the sign of the Casimir-capacity correlation diagnoses module type.

**New results (D106, D107):**
- D106 topological entropy null (PREDICTION FALSIFIED): both periodic and pseudo-Anosov braids compute XOR at 100% participation rate (first 128 catalog entries, W_{4,2}). Mean scores near-identical: periodic 3969, pA 3857. The null extends across ALL 8 Boolean functions tested (AND3, OR3, XOR3, MAJ3, NAND3, NOR3, AND2, XOR2); maximum gap 3.7pp. Entropy classification is totally orthogonal to DKC computation. The explanation: the TL quotient at delta=0 is a visibility filter. Writhe survives the quotient (multiplies bracket by (-A^3)^w) and correlates with DKC output (D83). Entropy does NOT survive the quotient (e_i^2=0 kills expanding eigenvalues). Properties invisible to the Kauffman bracket are invisible to DKC.
- D106 TL visibility filter (DEMONSTRATED): this crystallizes a principle latent since D83. Properties visible in the bracket (writhe) correlate with computation; properties invisible in the bracket (topological entropy, Burau spectral radius) do not. The TL quotient at delta=0 is the precise filter. The Burau representation is faithful for B_4 (Bigelow/Krammer), retaining all dynamical information -- but the extra information is computationally inert for DKC.
- D106 relational computation thesis (STRENGTHENED): DKC computation is collective/algebraic, not individual/dynamical. The question is never "is this braid good?" but "does this collection span the right algebraic structure?" Across the DKC program, relational/algebraic predictors (derived series strata, cross-stratum mixing, orthogonal frame geometry, k-granularity) are consistently strong; individual dynamical properties (entropy, spectral radius, word length) are consistently non-predictive. This sharpens D90's spectral inversion: individual braids carry less positional information at greater depth while the collection gains computational power.
- D106 Caruso genericity confirmed: pseudo-Anosov braids become generic at higher word lengths, crossing from minority to majority at depth 5 (50.6%) and reaching 77.2% at depth 8. Fibonacci pA at depth 2 achieve the theoretical optimal entropy per crossing: log(phi) = 0.481212 (Band & Boyland 2007).
- D107 Z/4Z Axis-Alignment Theorem as quantum-mechanical constraint (PROVEN): the proof that all braid matrix entries are axis-aligned at delta=0 has a quantum-mechanical interpretation: the TL quotient is so degenerate (delta=0 = quantum dimension vanishing) that the Kauffman bracket amplitude per matrix entry reduces to a single cyclotomic axis. The proof uses bipartiteness of TL link-state transition graphs -- a combinatorial structure ensuring destructive interference eliminates all cross-axis terms. This upgrades the axiality result (previously empirical, D35) to a theorem.
- D107 DKC reduces to integer path counting: the constructive Z/4Z phase formula Entry(r,c) = (path count) * zeta_8^{(w - 2*(nest(r) + nest(c))) mod 4} means DKC at delta=0 is effectively Z x Z/4Z computation per matrix entry. The quantum amplitudes have been decomposed into a classical counting problem (paths through the TL algebra) plus a discrete phase lookup. This is the simplest possible characterization of what the bracket computes at delta=0.

**Open questions specific to this lens:**
- Fibonacci TQFT boundary (mentioned at D05, n=5): what happens when we cross into the Fibonacci anyon regime?
- Connection to volume conjecture: WRT invariants at large r relate to hyperbolic volume -- does this have DKC implications?
- The entanglement vanishing theorem breaks at delta != 0 (D53). What is the precise crossover?
- Can multi-readout from different braid closures (D21, D25) be understood as a quantum measurement basis?
- Does the parity ceiling n=5 hold at Z[zeta_32] and all higher cyclotomic levels? If confirmed, it should be provable as a theorem about topological state sums independent of evaluation point (D65 conjecture).
- Does the Bloch sphere connection (S² = CP¹ = qubit state space) have a direct interpretation in quantum information? The DKC computation lives on the Bloch sphere at l=6 bandwidth (D71).
- Why do XOR8 winning quadruples use only the two canonical octahedral angles (45°, 90°) for individual entries, while additive sums produce non-canonical angles? Is there a quantum-group explanation for the distinction between entry-level and sum-level angle structure?
- Do all infinite-group roots (ζ₆, ζ₁₀, ζ₁₂, ...) have vanishing [2]_q? If not, what quantum-mechanical interpretation distinguishes finite (non-semisimple, lattice) from infinite (generic, #P-hard) roots?
- What is the precise LCFT crossover between the null-indispensable regime (ζ₈) and the null-dispensable regime (ζ₁₂)? Is there a critical null fraction or direction density at which Jordan-cell structure ceases to be computationally necessary?

**Connections to other lenses:**
- To Representation Theory: the R-matrix lives in the TL algebra. The quantum trace is computed via Jones-Wenzl projectors. Schur-Weyl duality decomposes tensor products into TL standard modules. The quantum trace formula unifies separate module traces (D06) into a single computation (D04). The SU(2) quaternionic representation (D66) lifts the scalar trace to a full geometric object: the 24-cell.
- To Coding Theory: the bracket amplitude at a root of unity IS a lattice point in Z[zeta_{2ell}]. The quantum amplitude is literally an algebraic integer. This is what makes forward DKC possible: quantum mechanics provides exact integer codewords. The Clifford hierarchy interpretation (D64) gives the T-gate ring its precise physical meaning.
- To Approximation Theory: the delta error landscape |delta| = 2|cos(2theta)| is a Chebyshev polynomial evaluated at the angle. Gate viability is determined by approximation quality: how close is the evaluation point to a root of the Chebyshev polynomial? The Hopf fibration inertness result (D67) says all computation is in the S² base, and spherical harmonics on that base have minimum bandwidth l=6 (D71).

## Lens 4: Approximation Theory

**What the research looks like:** The quantum dimensions [n]_q satisfy the Chebyshev recurrence [n+1]_q = [2]_q * [n]_q - [n-1]_q. The Jones-Wenzl idempotents are Chebyshev polynomials in the TL generators. The semicircle law governs eigenvalue distributions. The 11/13 theorem is a polynomial approximation barrier. The axiality theorem is about angular concentration of Fourier coefficients.

**Central demos:** D05 (quantum dimension recurrence -- explicit Chebyshev connection), D52 (Chebyshev generalization across ell values -- the entire demo is named for this lens), D14 (bracket zeros on the unit circle -- zero structure is {0, 4, 8}, universal angles at pi/4 and pi/8), D61-D62 (11/13 half-plane theorem -- the unreachability proofs for 0x1B and 0x06 are angular geometry arguments), D50 (triskelion principle -- sector geometry, incommensurability hypothesis), D104 (Atkinson sweet spot, cross-block incoherence, k as primary lever), D109 (encoding-dependent dual-channel inversion at delta=sqrt(2)).

**Core results belonging to this lens:**
- Quantum dimension recurrence: [n+1]_q = [2]_q * [n]_q - [n-1]_q. This IS the Chebyshev recurrence. At roots of unity, [n]_q vanishes and the Jones-Wenzl projector becomes singular -- this is where non-semisimplicity appears.
- Zero structure of torus knots: zero counts take values from {0, 4, 8} only. All zeros lie on the pi/8 lattice. The zero count pattern {8,0,0,8,4,4} for T(2,n), n=3,5,7,9,11,13 is cyclic, not monotonic.
- 0x1B unreachability proof: algebraic contradiction via interval squeeze. Three angles phi_1, phi_2, phi_3 cannot simultaneously satisfy the semicircle constraints imposed by the 0x1B truth table. The proof forces phi_3 > pi and phi_3 < pi.
- 0x06 unreachability proof: four-semicircle parallelogram argument. If alpha + beta > pi, all gaps are < pi, making the required intersection empty.
- Incommensurability hypothesis (D50): parity solution count anti-correlates with gcd(k,8). Sector boundaries misaligned with the pi/4 angular lattice break the symmetry blocking parity. k=6 (gcd=2) gives 906 solutions; k=8 (gcd=8) gives only 96.
- DKC-RT truncation connection (D63): DKC works because it uses pre-closure bracket information that RT truncation would discard. At delta=0 (ell=2), the most degenerate topological point gives the most structured algebraic point.
- Generalized activations break the wall (D65): arbitrary binary sector labelings (not just standard odd/even) remove the absolute wall at k<=23 and achieve XOR6 at k=24. This reveals a two-layer structure: the standard activation wall (k=15) is a labeling convention barrier, the generalized wall (k=24) is the true geometric obstruction. Standard and generalized walls are distinct objects.
- Two-layer wall decomposition (D65): Layer 1 (k=6 to k=15): standard odd/even labeling wall. Layer 2 (k=24): generalized minimum where any binary partition can first succeed. Below k=24, no binary coloring of k sectors can separate XOR6 regardless of which sectors are called 0 or 1.
- Zero margin universality (D65): all passing XOR6 tuples at all tested k values have exactly zero margin to the nearest sector boundary. Z[zeta_8] lattice sums land exactly on lattice directions (multiples of pi/4), aligning with sector boundaries only for compatible k values. Solutions are algebraically exact, not floating-point approximate.
- Voronoi activation on S³ (D66): lifting from S¹ to S³ (quaternionic weights) with a 24-cell Voronoi partition (25 cells: 24 vertices + zero cell) achieves 35 XOR6 solutions — more than the 64-cell geographic grid's 34. Data-intrinsic geometry beats geographic grids.
- S² as optimal activation space (D67): projecting quaternion weights to their eigenvector direction on S² and using a 13-direction Voronoi achieves 36 solutions at only 14 cells (2.57 sol/cell). This beats S¹ (25 cells) and S³ (25 cells). The Hopf S¹ fiber is completely inert: phase-only activation gives zero solutions at all resolutions. The computation lives entirely on the S² Hopf base.
- Platonic solids fail (D67, D70): octahedral, icosahedral, cuboctahedral, dodecahedral Voronoi partitions all yield zero XOR6 solutions. Data-intrinsic geometry (13 eigenvector directions of the binary octahedral group) is required; standard symmetric polytopal geometry is insufficient.
- Perceptron formulation (D68): the DKC architecture can be written as 6 bits → 2 neurons (linear combination of stereographic weight projections) → S² Voronoi activation → 1 bit. The 6×2 weight matrix comes from knot theory, not gradient descent. The computation is intrinsically curved: Euclidean nearest-neighbor in R² gives zero solutions; S² great-circle metric gives 36.
- The 13=13 theorem (D71): the minimum bandwidth for XOR6 DKC on S² is l=6 because mode l has (2l+1) independent spherical harmonic components and 2×6+1=13 equals the number of eigenvector directions. At l=5 there are 11 components (underdetermined); at l=6 there are exactly 13 (determined). The phase transition is sharp: 0% recovery at l<=5, 100% at l=6.
- Spectral universality (D71): all 36 XOR6 winning triples share the same spectral envelope — l=6 dominant (~80% power), l=4 secondary (~6%), l=12 tertiary (~6-7%). The spectrum is a structural invariant of XOR6 DKC solutions, not solution-specific noise.
- Super-Nyquist compression (D71): 14 Voronoi cells achieve what Nyquist predicts requires (l+1)²=49 cells — a 3.5× compression. Explained by compressed sensing: XOR6 is a binary function at 13 known support positions, so sparsity plus known support eliminates the generic sampling requirement.

**New results (D72, D73, D82):**
- D72 perturbation sensitivity (~5° robust, collapses at 10-20°): at 1° perturbation mean XOR6 count is 38 (slightly above unperturbed 36, showing near-miss solutions exist near the algebraic configuration). Robust through 5° (mean 35.8). Collapses at 10° (mean 11.5) and 20° (mean 2.1). The algebraic placement is sharp to approximately 5° — consistent with the typical angular Voronoi cell radius for 13 points on S². This is perturbation approximation: the DKC computation is locally stable but not globally continuous.
- D73 automaton determinism as approximation quality metric (82.8%): the fraction of deterministic cell transitions in the additive DKC trajectory is a well-defined approximation-theoretic quantity measuring how well the Voronoi partition approximates the computation as a Markov process. 82.8% universal determinism (48/58 transitions) is a structural constant. The 17% non-determinism comes from discarded magnitude information — the cell captures direction (compass) but not magnitude (odometer). A 27-state signed partition raises this to 87.1% but still not 100%, because 100% requires also tracking the magnitude modulo the weight lattice.
- D82 algebraic coherence vs vocabulary (approximation theory of discrete group actions): strided selection of 564 catalog entries (maximum spatial coverage: 512 dirs, 43 angles) cannot reach XOR12; deep selection of 564 entries (476 dirs, 19 angles) can. Algebraic coherence — the shared intermediate factor structure of depth-8 entries as products of 8 generators — dominates over angular coverage. This is an approximation-theoretic result about discrete group actions: for computing parity via Voronoi activation, the approximation quality is determined not by how well the weight directions sample S² uniformly but by whether the weights encode complementary algebraic structure from deep composition. The direction explosion / angle refinement phase transition at depth 6–7 is a clean approximation-theoretic boundary.

**New results (D83, D84):**
- D83 writhe and depth as independent approximation dimensions (r = 0.14): depth-writhe correlation across 4096 ζ₁₂ entries is near-zero, confirming that writhe and crossing depth are genuinely orthogonal approximation axes. Mean |writhe| grows linearly with depth (0.80 → 3.19 from depth 0 to depth 8), but the low correlation means these dimensions are not redundant — a braid of fixed depth can have nearly any writhe depending on chirality cancellation. The two resources contribute independently to the approximation capacity of the weight set.
- D84 S¹ × S² decomposition of activation space: the k_sec sweep on null-only entries reveals the cleanest decomposition of the two approximation components. Null-only entries have half-angle exactly 90° — a single point on S¹, carrying zero S¹ information. All of their computational contribution (XOR6 capacity, flat across k_sec) comes from S² directional diversity alone. Non-null entries carry both S¹ and S² content. The null/non-null partition is thus a clean anatomical decomposition into pure-S² and mixed-S¹×S² components. At k_sec=1 (direction-only scoring), null-only outperforms non-null-only (9 dirs vs 7 dirs), despite null-only having zero S¹ content — a direct experimental demonstration that S² approximation capacity is independent of S¹ approximation capacity.

**New results (D88, D90, D91):**
- D88 spherical design analysis and anti-correlation: the 13 ζ₈ directions (forming a cuboctahedron on S²) have spherical t=6 design residual 2.225 — NOT a 2-design, among the worst possible for 13 points on S². Three octahedral-symmetry orbits: 3 coordinate axes (shared, 90° mutual), 4 body diagonals (non-null-only, 70.5° mutual), 6 edge midpoints (null-only, 60°/90° mutual). The directions worst for spherical integration are best for DKC computation — the anti-correlation between sampling quality and computational quality (first observed in D72) is now geometrically characterized.
- D88 two-role direction theorem: the 4 non-null body-diagonal directions are rigid computational anchors (8.0% XOR loss under 10° perturbation), while the 6 null-only edge-midpoint directions are flexible topological scaffolding (-2.4% loss, i.e., slight gain under perturbation). Constrained optimization (nulls free, non-nulls clamped to 2°) achieves 48% design improvement with only 2.8% XOR loss — capturing 92% of unconstrained improvement at less than half the computational cost.
- D88 k-ladder resilience: the Sec*Vor k-ladder activation provides 14x better perturbation resilience than D72's Voronoi-only activation under the same design-improving gradient (6.4% loss vs 89% loss). The mechanism: multiple k_sec values provide fallback resolutions when direction perturbation invalidates the optimal sector assignment. The activation function is the primary variable controlling perturbation sensitivity, not the optimization procedure.
- D88 cross-root comparison: ζ₁₂ has per-direction spherical design residual 8x lower than ζ₈ (0.021 vs 0.171). This provides the geometric explanation for D87's null dispensability finding: denser directions improve per-direction integration quality, making null-only directions unnecessary for S² coverage.
- D90 spectral inversion (DEMONSTRATED): the S² point cloud bandwidth DECREASES as BFS depth increases. BW_90% drops from l=4 (depth 0 only) to l=2 (cumulative all depths); BW_99% drops from l=11 to l=6. The point cloud converges to spherical uniformity (l=0 dominant). Computational power grows monotonically while positional information content degrades monotonically — ruling out ALL positional/bandwidth-based explanations for the depth law. The Altschuler-Parrilo point-cloud-spectrum hypothesis is INVERTED and dead as formulated.
- D90 relational computation thesis: the depth law mechanism is relational, not positional. What matters is how entries combine (axis cancellation between anti-aligned quaternion pairs, cross-depth algebraic constraints from BFS ancestry limiting sum-angle vocabularies to 73 distinct angles from 50K gen x deep pairs), not where they individually sit on S². The spectral inversion is the cleanest evidence: positions become less informative while computation improves.
- D91 resolution invariance: the combined_cell activation is NOT the bottleneck. Max XOR arity is invariant across all k_sec values (2-48) and all Voronoi direction counts (2-114). Even 4 total cells (k=2 with 2 dirs) can compute XOR8. Finer resolution reveals MORE solutions (586 at k=2 to 7652 at k=48) but never enables HIGHER parity. The depth gap (XOR6 to XOR8) is constant across all resolutions, confirming that the wall is the parity constraint itself — not an activation artifact.
- D91 balanced exponentials confirmed from complementary direction: D90's preliminary argument is confirmed. The linear depth law arises from the supply/demand ratio (vocabulary ~2x per depth round vs parity demand 4x per weight level = ~2 depth per weight = slope 1). If activation were the bottleneck, finer resolution would shift the depth gap — it does not.

**New results (D96, D97, D99-D101):**
- D96 two-dimensional synergy landscape: the 5-cell landscape (A-E) from crossing D84's null/non-null with D95's derived series provides a complete 2D approximation classification of the z8 codebook. The key approximation result: the null/non-null boundary matters more than the derived level boundary at every arity. This is a dimensionality-reduction result for DKC weight selection -- one binary classifier (null?) outperforms four-level derived series for predicting computational utility.
- D97 lever arm mechanism: the nonzero real component of the quaternion (cos(half-angle/2)) provides the "lever arm" for phase_cell to separate XOR=0 from XOR=1 sums. The 50-degree perfection plateau (25-75 degrees) is the approximation-theoretic range where the lever arm is strong enough for separation. At 90 degrees (null), zero lever = zero separation. At extreme low angles (<25 degrees), imaginary differences shrink below discrimination threshold.
- D97 octahedral optimality: 6 points at vertices of a regular octahedron on S² form the maximally symmetric arrangement, providing maximal mutual angular separation. This is an approximation-theoretic optimality result: among all 6-point arrangements on S², the octahedron maximizes the minimum pairwise angle, which maximizes Voronoi cell size for phase_cell discrimination.
- D99 two-regime approximation: combinatorial regime (XOR6-8) is diversity-driven -- shallow entries with many different sign patterns suffice. Algebraic regime (XOR10-14) requires deep entries with high Casimir -- eigenvalue separation becomes the bottleneck. The phase transition at XOR8→XOR10 is an approximation complexity boundary: below it, the approximation is controlled by partition diversity; above it, by algebraic preparation quality.
- D99-D101 sl_d growth rates as approximation capacity scaling: BFS growth ~2x, ~3.1x, ~4x for 3,4,5-strand. The approximation capacity of the matrix codebook grows proportionally to the number of TL generators (n-1). Faster growth means more entries per depth round, potentially faster convergence to deep-entry capacity.
- D101 broader shallow capacity: W_{5,3} (4x4 simple, faster growth) has MORE XOR6-8 solutions than W_{4,2} (3x3 non-semisimple, slower growth). The approximation interpretation: faster codebook growth provides more diverse entries at shallow depths, improving low-arity approximation quality. But deep capacity (XOR14) requires the non-semisimple extension -- growth rate alone is insufficient.

**New results (D104, D109):**
- D104 Atkinson sweet spot as approximation tradeoff: the non-monotonic component-count curve for W_{6,2} (peak at 120 of 324 components, XOR6=2486) is an approximation-theoretic phenomenon: too few sign components = insufficient information to discriminate entries; too many = hash space too sparse for useful collisions; optimal = the Atkinson sweet spot where information-per-collision is maximized. The peak is k-dependent -- at higher k (more cells), more components become usable because the collision structure tolerates sparser hashes. This is analogous to optimal quantization in dithering: the resolution that balances signal fidelity against useful noise structure.
- D104 branching cross-terms have low intra-block coherence: the W_{6,2} cross-block activation (160 components from off-diagonal blocks under TL_5 branching) outperforms within-block (164 diagonal components) at XOR8 dramatically (952 vs omitted). This is the 1-bit compressed sensing incoherence condition: the two TL_5 sub-pieces (through-strand dim=5, arc-bound dim=4) are near-orthogonal, so their cross-terms have maximal information per sign measurement. The within-block components are internally coherent, wasting measurement capacity on redundant information.
- D104 k is the real lever (DEMONSTRATED): increasing k (cell count) is the primary scaling lever for XOR capacity, not activation architecture. Multi-hash does NOT improve over single-hash at matched k. At k=4096, W_{6,0} full (100 comp) produces XOR8=21699 while W_{6,2} cross-block (160 comp) produces XOR8=19994 -- W_{6,0} wins at every k despite W_{6,2} having richer algebra. The approximation interpretation: resolution dominates design at sufficient cell counts.
- D109 encoding-dependent dual-channel theorem (NOVEL, refines D108): at delta=sqrt(2), Raqiya graph analysis CANNOT discriminate parity from non-parity on 7 of 8 edge types. Product closure is the sole distinguisher -- and its polarity is INVERTED from D108. Under additive encoding (D108, delta=0), parity wants HIGH product closure (self-reinforcement through superposition). Under multiplicative encoding (D109, delta=sqrt(2)), parity wants LOW product closure (products must escape vocabulary for sector alternation). The dual-channel theorem holds in both regimes but the polarity of the multiplicative channel is encoding-sensitive.
- D109 perfect algebraic symmetry at delta=sqrt(2): parity and non-parity vocabularies are structurally indistinguishable on 7/8 edge types and all classification metrics. The 28/28 = 50/50 split (perfectly symmetric, unlike D108's 41/59 asymmetry) reflects the richness of Z[zeta_16] algebra where j=0 sector is alive. Axis distribution identical (8,6,8,6), norm classes identical (4), v_2 classes identical (4), Galois orbits identical (15).
- D109 universal structural satisfaction explains activation simplicity: both vocabularies satisfy all structural prerequisites (K_4 product axis quotient, non-trivial v_2 connectivity, adequate additive closure). At delta=sqrt(2), Re>0 suffices as activation because no structural deficits need compensating -- the activation just classifies an already-rich set by angular position. This contrasts sharply with D108 where algebraic impoverishment (delta=0) makes structural deficits detectable.
- D109 j=0 liveness implies structural universality (CONJECTURED): at delta=0, j=0 dead implies impoverished algebra implies structural asymmetry detectable by Raqiya. At delta!=0, j=0 alive implies rich algebra implies structural universality. Raqiya diagnoses algebraic impoverishment, not algebraic health. The approximation interpretation: when the algebra provides enough diversity, the approximation problem is easy (Re>0 suffices); the hard case (D108) is when algebraic poverty forces the activation to do more work.

**Open questions specific to this lens:**
- Can the cyclic zero pattern {8,0,0,8,4,4} be explained by a Chebyshev identity?
- Is there a Chebyshev polynomial characterization of which NPN classes require k sectors?
- Can the triskelion principle (each input needs its own odd sector at 120-degree intervals) be derived from approximation-theoretic bounds on angular separation? **FALSIFIED** -- triskelion generalization does not hold; the angular separation requirement is specific to n=3, not a universal principle.
- Does the incommensurability hypothesis generalize: for n-input parity, is the minimum sector count k=2n?
- Z[zeta_16] scaling: does the richer angular lattice of ell=3 push the parity ceiling beyond n=5, or is the capacity limit intrinsic to the activation geometry rather than the ring? **ANSWERED (D65): the ceiling is algebra-independent; it stays at n=5.**
- Can the 13=13 theorem be proven analytically: is the minimum bandwidth of any binary Voronoi partition separating N points on S² in general position equal to l=ceil((N-1)/2)?
- Is there a scaling law for XOR_n minimum k, and does the growth rate discriminate polynomial from exponential (D65 data: XOR6 k=24, XOR7 k=91, ratio ~3.8)?
- Does the generalized XOR6 first-pass threshold k=24 change when using Z[zeta_16] weights?
- Is the ~5° robustness threshold exactly equal to the Voronoi cell angular radius, or is there a deeper approximation-theoretic reason the two coincide?
- Can the 82.8% automaton determinism be expressed as a ratio of integers arising from the binary octahedral group, and does it generalize to other finite SU(2) subgroups?
- Is there a clean characterization of which 564 deep entries achieve XOR12 while 564 strided entries do not — i.e., can the algebraic coherence property be stated as an approximation condition on the weight set? **ANSWERED (D90): axis cancellation + cross-depth algebraic constraint. Deep entries preferentially contain anti-aligned axis pairs (mean min_dot = -0.75 for winners) and BFS ancestry constrains their sum-angle vocabulary.**
- Does the linear depth law hold for ALL Boolean functions, or just parity? D92 shows the ±q encoding is parity-locked, so the question reframes: does the balanced-exponentials linearity (vocabulary ~2x per depth round vs constraint 4x per weight) generalize to other encodings and functions?

**Connections to other lenses:**
- To Representation Theory: the Chebyshev recurrence IS the quantum dimension recurrence. When [ell]_q = 0, the Jones-Wenzl idempotent p_ell is singular and the algebra becomes non-semisimple. Approximation theory predicts EXACTLY where the algebra changes character. The 13 eigenvector directions are a representation-theoretic count (binary octahedral group mod ±1 = 24 quaternions → 13 directions), and the 13=13 theorem makes this count analytically consequential.
- To Coding Theory: the 11/13 theorem is a covering problem. The 2 unreachable NPN classes are truth tables that fall outside the covering radius of any angular constellation under half-plane quantization. The proofs use semicircle geometry, which is approximation theory. The two-layer wall structure (D65) refines the coding picture: the standard layer is a labeling convention, the generalized layer is a genuine lattice coverage impossibility.
- To Quantum Mechanics: the delta error landscape |delta| = 2|cos(2theta)| is a Chebyshev polynomial. Gate viability (D20) is controlled by how close the evaluation angle is to a Chebyshev root. The "magic angle" 5pi/4 is magic precisely because it is a root. The S² computation space is the Bloch sphere of the SU(2) braid representation, and the l=6 bandwidth corresponds to hexadecapole angular momentum modes (D71).

## The Unified View

The deepest results sit at the intersection of all four lenses:

**The parity wall** is simultaneously:
- (Rep Theory) a consequence of non-semisimplicity -- bracket evaluation factors through TL/rad, killing radical degrees of freedom
- (Coding Theory) a lattice covering impossibility -- no four Z[zeta_8] codewords under split-sigmoid can produce the parity truth table
- (Quantum Mechanics) a decoherence effect -- the radical is "invisible" under standard bracket evaluation, just as decoherent states are invisible to quantum measurement
- (Approx Theory) an angular separation barrier -- k=2 sectors cannot place 3 weights in distinct odd sectors (the triskelion requires k=6)

**The axiality theorem** is simultaneously:
- (Rep Theory) a rank collapse: semisimple quotient at delta=0 is so constrained that bracket values use only 1 of 4 cyclotomic coordinates
- (Coding Theory) extreme constellation collapse: a rank-4 lattice degenerates to rank 1
- (Quantum Mechanics) single-loop selection: delta=0 kills all multi-loop states, and surviving states have phases related by A^4 = -1
- (Approx Theory) angular concentration: all bracket values at delta=0 point in one of 8 directions (multiples of pi/4)

**The forward DKC construction** assembles all four:
- Abramsky (Rep Theory): TL diagrams encode computation
- Habiro (Quantum Mechanics): bracket values are cyclotomic integers
- Aizenberg (Approx Theory): k-sector activation reads angular structure
- Nazer-Gastpar (Coding Theory): algebraic integer lattices support exact computation

These are not analogies. They are the same mathematics described in four languages.

**The S² computation result (D66-D71)** is a fifth unification:
- (Rep Theory): the binary octahedral group (image of braid group under SU(2)) has exactly 13 eigenvector directions; the direction count is the representation-theoretic fact underlying everything below
- (QM / TQFT): under the Hopf fibration S³ → S², the S¹ fiber is computationally inert; all information lives in the Hopf base S², which is the Bloch sphere of the SU(2) representation
- (Coding Theory): the 24 quaternions of the binary octahedral group carry 100 distinct bracket values; bracket and quaternion are complementary hash functions (12.86% collision agreement, 80% mutual divergence)
- (Approx Theory): the minimum S² bandwidth for XOR6 is l=6, determined by the counting identity 2×6+1=13; compressed sensing explains the 3.5× sub-Nyquist efficiency of the 14-cell Voronoi

**The parity wall** is simultaneously:
- (Rep Theory): the 13 eigenvector directions = 2l+1 at l=6 is the DOF boundary; n=5 is the last input count for which the Z[zeta_8] bracket solutions have enough directions to span the required computation
- (Coding Theory): the vocabulary stratification (44 good / 31 poison) is the lattice-theoretic shadow of a matroid minor obstruction
- (QM): the Clifford hierarchy level (T-gate = level 3, ring = Z[zeta_8]) determines the angle structure; self-doubling = T→S descent = wall mechanism
- (Approx Theory): the two-layer wall (standard at k=15, generalized at k=24) separates labeling convention from genuine geometric obstruction

**The finite-vs-infinite group boundary (D79-D82)** is a sixth unification:
- (Rep Theory): ζ₄ → Binary Dihedral (D-series, ADE), ζ₈ → Binary Octahedral (E₇, ADE). Finite groups close at fixed catalog sizes; the ADE classification of finite SU(2) subgroups exactly characterizes the tractable DKC regime. Non-exceptional roots generate infinite (dense) SU(2) subgroups.
- (QM): the finite cases are the singular (lattice) points of quantum group parameter space where [2]_q ∈ {0, ±2}. The quantum dimension vanishing at ζ₈ ([2]_q = 0) is the most degenerate case — simultaneously the DKC sweet spot and the TL non-semisimplicity maximum.
- (Coding Theory): finite groups impose hard XOR capacity ceilings (ζ₈ caps at XOR8); infinite groups give logarithmic scaling (ζ₁₂: max_xor ≈ 0.62 × log₂(catalog_size) + 4.6). The coding capacity is determined by group finiteness, not by the ring's algebraic degree or cyclotomic index.
- (Approx Theory): the linear depth law (max_xor ≈ depth + 6) expresses the approximation cost of DKC in terms of knot-crossing complexity. Algebraic coherence (shared deep intermediate products) dominates over angular vocabulary (coverage of S²). The Kuperberg #P-hardness of generating deep entries at non-lattice roots is the approximation-theoretic price of unbounded capacity.

**Framing and null states as resource anatomy (D83-D84)** is a seventh unification:
- (Rep Theory): Jones normalization removes a writhe-graded module structure (the abelianization of the braid group acting by a 1-dimensional character). The 2-level capacity loss is the dimension of the discarded grading. Null states are radical-module elements whose bracket trace vanishes — precisely the objects whose Jordan-cell structure (non-semisimplicity) makes the ζ₈ algebra computationally exceptional. Semisimple ζ₄ has 75% null fraction but only XOR6 capacity; non-semisimple ζ₈ has 37.5% null fraction and XOR8 capacity. Non-semisimplicity IS the computational resource.
- (QM / TQFT): the writhe-phase factor is a TQFT framing anomaly; removing it (Jones normalization) is a gauge-fixing operation, and D83 measures the information cost of that gauge choice in XOR units. Null states have the LCFT interpretation: Re(q)=0 entries are analogs of null states in LCFT (zero two-point function, nonzero vectors), paired with logarithmic partners via Jordan-cell L₀ action. The dense polymer model at β=0 (δ=0 Kauffman bracket) is where Jordan-cell structure is physically natural. Non-diagonalizability of L₀ = non-semisimplicity of TL = computational exceptionality of ζ₈.
- (Coding Theory): the resource decomposition is an additive capacity formula: lattice (XOR6) + depth (+2 per unit) + writhe (+2 framing) = total. These are independent coding channels — confirmed by depth-writhe correlation r=0.14. Null entries condition the effective rank of the directional codebook: removing 9 null entries collapses the direction vocabulary from 13 to 7, performing worse than removing a random 9-entry subset. Null states maximize effective rank by exclusively populating 6 cube-edge-midpoint directions unreachable by non-null entries.
- (Approx Theory): writhe and depth are nearly orthogonal approximation dimensions (r=0.14), contributing independently to the approximation capacity of the weight set. The null/non-null partition cleanly decomposes the S¹ × S² activation space: null entries are pure S² (zero S¹ content, half-angle exactly 90°), non-null entries are mixed S¹ × S². At k_sec=1 (direction-only scoring), null-only outperforms non-null-only — demonstrating that S² and S¹ approximation capacity are independent components.
- (Reservoir Computing — Pillar 5): writhe and depth as independent computational axes directly parallels RC memory depth (depth) and nonlinearity degree (writhe). Null states maintain the separation property of the RC manifold: they hold the reservoir state space open in directions that active (non-null) states do not cover. Removing null reservoir states collapses the manifold in those directions, destroying the linear separability of higher-order parity functions — exactly the mechanism observed in D84. The "+2 per resource unit" pattern (depth and writhe each add +2) matches the independent-channel additivity expected from reservoir theory when channels are orthogonal.

**The depth law mechanism (D89-D91)** is an eighth unification:
- (Rep Theory): the BFS closure is a walk on the Cayley graph of the SU(2) subgroup. Cross-depth algebraic constraints (gen x deep = only 73 distinct sum angles from 50K pairs vs 1313 for deep x deep) reflect algebraic relationships imposed by the group multiplication table. The axis cancellation mechanism — anti-aligned rotation axes producing low sum angles — is the geometric realization of how the binary octahedral group's conjugacy classes interact under addition.
- (QM / TQFT): the spectral inversion (S² bandwidth decreasing with depth while computational power increases) rules out all state-space positional explanations. The computation is relational: what matters is how quantum amplitudes interfere (axis cancellation = partial destructive interference of rotation axes), not where individual states sit on the Bloch sphere. This parallels the TQFT principle that topological invariants encode global rather than local information.
- (Coding Theory): the balanced exponentials principle (vocabulary ~2x/round vs parity demand 4x/weight = slope 1) is a capacity argument in the Shannon tradition — linear scaling emerges from the ratio of two exponential processes. D91's resolution invariance confirms the wall is parity (the coding constraint), not activation (the decoding scheme). D92's parity-lock theorem shows the ±q encoding's 3^k equivalence classes are the coding-theoretic reason the depth law is parity-specific.
- (Approx Theory): D91 demonstrates that activation resolution (angular sectors, Voronoi directions) controls the number of solutions but not their existence — max_xor is invariant from k=2 to k=48. The depth gap between XOR levels is a parity constraint, not an approximation barrier. D88's k-ladder provides 14x perturbation resilience over Voronoi-only, with the mechanism being multiple fallback resolutions per geometric perturbation.

**Complement-blindness and circuit complexity hierarchy (D93)** is a tenth unification:
- (Rep Theory): the complement-blindness theorem arises from the quaternionic representation structure — negating all input bits sends the quaternion sum S to -S, and the |qa| normalization in combined_cell identifies S with -S. Phase_cell (no sign flip) restores the full [0,360) sector span and recovers all 13 NPN classes. The binary octahedral group's action on the phase_cell partition determines which functions are achievable at each N.
- (QM / Circuit Complexity): the AND/XOR ratio explosion (1.01 to infinity across N=3-8) IS Hastad's theorem (1987) made visible in a topological computation model. AND is in AC⁰ (low Fourier degree → simple partition geometry → robust under cell-count limits). MAJ is TC⁰-complete (intermediate degree → cliff at N=8). XOR is parity (full Fourier degree → requires balanced bisection → killed by pigeonhole when 2^N > cells). The Furst-Saxe-Sipser/Hastad/LMN circuit complexity hierarchy manifests as hit-rate divergence in the DKC Voronoi × sector partition.
- (Coding Theory): the pigeonhole mechanism (84 cells at depth 1, XOR dies when 2^N > 84 at N>=7) is a discrete channel capacity limit. AND survives because it needs only 1 unique cell for the all-1s mask — the extreme case of a low-degree function needing minimal partition complexity. The hierarchy of Boolean function difficulty maps directly to partition-complexity requirements of the discrete codebook.
- (Approx Theory): depth disproportionately helps parity (AND/XOR ratio converges from 7.27 to 1.08 over d=1 to d=6 at N=6). XOR growth is logarithmic saturation, not exponential. The circuit complexity hierarchy manifests as differential depth sensitivity — a new approximation-theoretic observable connecting the Hastad depth hierarchy to DKC catalog depth.

**Solvability bottleneck and five-pillar synthesis (D94)** is an eleventh unification:
- (Rep Theory): the binary icosahedral group 2I (E₈, order 120) is the unique non-solvable finite SU(2) subgroup. Its 9 conjugacy classes and 31 distinct S² directions provide a richer representation-theoretic structure than z8's (E₇, solvable). The ADE classification's endpoint E₈ IS the solvability boundary — every finite SU(2) subgroup below E₈ in the classification is solvable.
- (QM / TQC): 2I at the Fibonacci parameter has quantum dimension [2]_q = phi^{-1} ≈ 0.618. The same group that makes Fibonacci anyons universal for quantum computation (Burrello et al. 2010) makes DKC maximally powerful among finite groups. Non-solvability of 2I is what Barrington (1989) identified for classical computation AND what Freedman-Larsen-Wang (2002) used for universal TQC — the same algebraic property is load-bearing in both paradigms.
- (Coding Theory): the matched-size comparison (24 vs 24 entries, z8 vs random 2I subsets) isolates solvability as a coding-theoretic capacity variable. The advantage accelerates with computational difficulty (1.07x→1.67x across N=3-6) — exactly what Barrington predicts: non-solvable groups are strictly more powerful for branching programs, and the gap grows with program length. The E₈ lattice connection (Liu & Calderbank 2008) identifies the ring of icosians (integer combinations of 2I elements) as E₈ — maximal distinguishability.
- (Approx Theory): the crossover at N=6 (z12 wins at small N due to angular variety, 2I wins at N=6-7 due to non-solvability) reveals two independent approximation resources: density (angular variety, benefits coarse functions) and solvability structure (benefits fine-grained parity). These contribute differently to approximation capacity and dominate in different regimes.
- (Reservoir Computing — Pillar 5): the precise mapping is now complete. Fixed catalog = reservoir, Cayley graph = connectivity, signed sum = linear readout, activation = nonlinear output, BFS depth = memory depth. Non-solvable groups are expander graphs (high mixing, good separation) — the reservoir topology property that predicts computational power. The testable RKHS kernel prediction (rank ratio > size ratio) would confirm non-solvability as a reservoir-quality indicator above raw reservoir size.

**The parity-lock theorem (D92)** is a twelfth unification:
- (Rep Theory): the ±q encoding's sign-flip symmetry (combined_cell(S) = combined_cell(-S)) is a consequence of the quaternionic representation structure — negating a quaternion preserves its rotation axis and angle. The 3^k equivalence classes arise from the additive structure of the SU(2) weight lattice under the paired encoding.
- (QM): parity is the single Boolean function outside AC^0, the one that requires exponential circuit depth in the classical AND/OR/NOT basis. The DKC construction concentrates all computational power on this specific function — the function that is hardest classically is the one that topological quantum amplitudes naturally compute. The (0,0)=(1,1) collision (masks 0...0 and 1...1 always produce zero sums) is a quantum-mechanical selection rule: the encoding preserves total "charge" (parity) while making individual bit values undetectable.
- (Coding Theory): the parity-lock is a coding constraint — the equivalence class structure of the ±q codebook admits only parity-constant labelings. AND/OR/MAJ all violate f(0...0) != f(1...1), making them structurally impossible under any activation. The 76 mask collisions (all same-parity, zero cross-parity) confirm the code's parity-preserving structure.
- (Approx Theory): the sign-flip symmetry collapses 27 equivalence classes to at most 14 distinguishable groups under the combined_cell activation. XOR winners use 11-13 of these groups; non-winners use 6-11. The approximation capacity is concentrated on the parity function by the encoding geometry, not by the activation resolution.

**The Barrington-Radical Principle (D102) and axis-alignment proof (D107)** is a thirteenth unification:
- (Rep Theory): the radical of non-semisimple TL modules carries an abelian writhe character B_n -> Z/8Z. By Barrington's theorem, abelian groups cannot compute parity. Therefore the radical is provably useless for XOR. Simultaneously, the Z/4Z axis-alignment theorem proves all braid matrix entries are single-axis in Z[zeta_8] at delta=0, with the constructive phase formula reducing DKC to integer path counting + Z/4Z phase lookup. The nesting parity Z/2Z grading provides the combinatorial structure underlying the bipartiteness that guarantees axis-alignment.
- (QM): the TL visibility filter (D106) crystallizes what survives the TL quotient at delta=0: writhe survives (and correlates with computation), topological entropy does not. The axis-alignment proof is a quantum degeneracy consequence -- delta=0 (quantum dimension vanishing) forces bracket amplitudes onto single cyclotomic axes. The phase formula Entry(r,c) = (path count) * zeta_8^{phase} is the simplest characterization of what the bracket computes.
- (Coding Theory): the Dual-Channel Theorem (D108) establishes that parity capability requires both multiplicative phase coherence (product closure > 0) and additive magnitude diversity (v_2 connectivity > trivial). Poison values fail on BOTH channels simultaneously. This maps onto the T-gate/Hadamard decomposition in quantum circuit synthesis (Amy et al. 2023). The sign-rank expansion (D104) shows that 1-bit sign quantization is an information EXPANDER, not just a lossy quantizer.
- (Approx Theory): the Atkinson sweet spot (D104) identifies the optimal information-per-collision tradeoff in sign-hash quantization. The encoding-dependent dual-channel inversion (D109) shows that the polarity of the multiplicative channel flips between additive and multiplicative encoding, with j=0 liveness at delta!=0 providing such algebraic richness that even the simplest activation (Re>0) suffices.

**The macrame principle and k-regime theory (D105)** is a fourteenth unification:
- (Rep Theory): branching interaction (cross-block vs within-block under TL_{n-1} restriction) reverses between n=6 (asymmetric blocks dim 5+4, cross-block wins) and n=8 (symmetric blocks dim 14+14, within-block wins). The crossover is a regime transition in sub-module complexity. The sl_d growth rate thesis is confirmed at a fourth strand count (3->~2x, 4->~3.1x, 5->~4x, 6->~5x, 8->~7x).
- (Coding Theory): D93's "XOR dies at N>=7" is REFUTED as a k-regime artifact. The ratio k/2^N is the real control parameter: pigeonhole at k/2^N << 1 kills XOR; collision avoidance at k/2^N >> 1 restores it. W_{8,0} at k=4096 produces XOR8=22266, beating n=6.
- (QM): the k-regime theory at n=8 confirms that the information-theoretic structure of sign-hash activation (pigeonhole vs collision-avoidance) is independent of strand count and module choice. The computational physics of DKC scales cleanly with braid group size.
- (Approx Theory): rank saturation methodology (D105) establishes that single-checkpoint rank measurements are unreliable for infinite braid groups. Sign-rank expansion (from nonlinear sign projection) increases with module dimension, providing richer effective approximation spaces at higher strands.
