# Demo 65: Clifford Hierarchy Staircase — Findings

## 1. The Question

Demo 64's open question #1: Does XOR6 become achievable at Z[zeta_16], the next level of the Clifford hierarchy?

Z[zeta_16] is the algebraic ring generated by T-gate operations (zeta_16 = e^{i*pi/8}). It has phi(16) = 8 components — double Z[zeta_8]'s 4. The key difference: delta = -sqrt(2) != 0, so ALL braid states contribute to the bracket (not just single-loop states as at delta=0).

The pigeonhole bound for Z[zeta_16] is n <= 14 (14 of 16 angular directions occupied). If the "gap of 2" pattern from Z[zeta_8] (pigeonhole 7, actual 5) held, the ceiling would be n = 12.

## 2. The Answer: No. The Ceiling is Still n = 5.

**XOR6 = 0 at every sector count k = 2..31, tested with both the base catalog (36 values) and extended catalog (56 values).**

The parity ceiling does not climb the Clifford hierarchy. It is algebra-independent.

## 3. Z[zeta_16] Catalog Structure

### Base Catalog (2-3 strand braids, length <= 8)
- **36 distinct nonzero bracket values** (vs Z[zeta_8]'s 100)
- 24/36 axial (single nonzero component, 66.7%)
- 12/36 with exactly 2 nonzero components
- Max coefficient magnitude: 2
- All 8 basis coordinates used
- 14/16 angular directions occupied (missing dirs 2 and 11, at 45.0 and 247.5 degrees)
- 20/36 values lie in the Z[zeta_8] subring

### Extended Catalog (adding 4-strand braids)
- **56 values** (+20 new from 4 strands)
- 4-strand braids contribute at every length 1-6 (lengths 7-8 skipped: >100K braids)
- Catalog is NOT yet converged — 5-strand braids would likely add more

### Embedding Overlap
- Only 8/100 Z[zeta_8] catalog values appear in the Z[zeta_16] catalog
- 20/36 Z[zeta_16] values lie in Z[zeta_8] subring, but only 8 match Z[zeta_8] catalog values
- The two catalogs are MOSTLY DISJOINT — different braid evaluation regimes (delta=0 vs delta=-sqrt(2)) produce different value sets

## 4. NPN Tier Structure

### Tier Thresholds (Identical to Z[zeta_8])

| XOR_n | First k (Z[zeta_8]) | First k (Z[zeta_16]) | Match? |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|
| XOR3  | k=6                 | k=6                  | YES    |
| XOR4  | k=8                 | k=8                  | YES    |
| XOR5  | k=14                | k=14                 | YES    |
| XOR6  | impossible          | impossible            | YES    |

The tier thresholds are EXACTLY the same. Climbing from Z[zeta_8] to Z[zeta_16] changes nothing about when parity at each input count first becomes achievable.

### XOR5 Solution Landscape (36-value catalog)

Only 2 sector counts produce XOR5 solutions with the base catalog:
- k=14: 120 solutions
- k=15: 480 solutions
- k=16..31: all 0

### XOR5 Solution Landscape (56-value catalog)

Catalog extension reveals solutions at higher k that were hidden by incompleteness:
- k=14: 120 solutions (unchanged)
- k=15: 1,080 solutions (was 480)
- k=17: 240 solutions (new)
- k=21: 240 solutions (new)
- k=31: 960 solutions (was 0!)

**The k=31 zero with 36 values was a catalog incompleteness artifact.** The extended catalog reveals XOR5 is achievable at the universal k, as expected.

### XOR6 Full Sweep (56-value catalog)

| k | XOR6 solutions |
|---|----------------|
| 2..31 | ALL ZERO |

Zero at every single k value. The wall is genuine.

## 5. Catalog Incompleteness vs Genuine Wall

This demo reveals an important methodological distinction:

**Catalog incompleteness** can produce false negatives. The 36-value catalog showed 0 XOR5 at k=31, but extending to 56 values gave 960 solutions. Had we stopped at 36 values, we might have incorrectly concluded the XOR5 landscape was narrower than it is.

**The XOR6 wall is genuine** — surviving catalog extension from 36 to 56 values with zero solutions at ALL 30 sector counts. Each k=31 run exhaustively tests all C(33,6) ~ 1.1M ordered 6-tuples (with pruning). The wall persists regardless of catalog size.

## 6. The "Gap of 2" Hypothesis: REFUTED

| Ring | Pigeonhole bound | Actual ceiling | Gap |
|------|-----------------|----------------|-----|
| Z[zeta_8]  | n <= 7  | n = 5 | 2 |
| Z[zeta_16] | n <= 14 | n = 5 | 9 |

The gap is NOT constant. Moving to a richer ring with double the angular directions does not raise the parity ceiling at all. The gap widens from 2 to 9.

This refutes the simplest form of the "Clifford staircase" hypothesis — that XOR_n requires the n-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. Instead, the ceiling appears to be a universal constant (n=5) independent of the cyclotomic algebra.

## 7. Why the Ceiling Doesn't Climb

### The Catalog Paradox
Z[zeta_16] has MORE angular resolution (16 directions vs 8) but FEWER bracket values (36 vs 100). This is because delta != 0 causes multi-loop state cancellation — the bracket is a sum over all 2^L states weighted by delta^{loops-1}, and these terms partially cancel. The Z[zeta_8] regime (delta=0) kills multi-loop states entirely but preserves ALL single-loop contributions, producing a richer catalog.

### Angular Directions Don't Help
Even though Z[zeta_16] occupies 14/16 directions (vs Z[zeta_8]'s 8/8), the tier thresholds are identical. The constraint isn't about having enough directions — it's about the *compatibility structure* of subset sums. With 6 weights, there are 2^6 - 1 = 63 subset sums that must all satisfy parity constraints simultaneously. The number of available directions doesn't relax this combinatorial bottleneck.

### The Wall is in Interaction Geometry
Demo 64 showed the wall manifests at the interaction level (weight-2+ errors only). This interaction-level obstruction is about how sums of pairs/triples/etc. of catalog values distribute across sectors — a property that depends on the algebraic structure of sums, not on the richness of the underlying ring.

## 8. Quantum Computation Implications

### Clifford Hierarchy Independence
Z[zeta_8] = T-gate ring (3rd level Clifford hierarchy). Z[zeta_16] corresponds to the 4th level. The parity ceiling being identical at both levels means:

**The computational reach of DKC for parity is NOT a function of Clifford hierarchy level.**

This is surprising given the quantum computation context. Moving up the Clifford hierarchy is supposed to increase computational power (more magic states, more non-Clifford gates). But for the specific task of computing parity via bracket weights + sector activation, the additional algebraic resources provide no advantage.

### Possible Interpretation
The parity ceiling may be set by the *topological* structure of the Kauffman bracket (state-sum over crossing resolutions, closure to loops), not by the *algebraic* structure of the evaluation point. The bracket's topological constraints on how values compose through braid concatenation may impose a universal upper bound on parity computation that no change of evaluation point can overcome.

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Z[zeta_32] and beyond**: Does the ceiling remain n=5 at all cyclotomic levels? If so, this becomes a theorem about topological state sums, not algebra.

2. **Catalog convergence**: The 56-value catalog is NOT converged. Does extending to 5+ strands or longer braids grow it significantly? Does it approach Z[zeta_8]'s 100 eventually?

3. **Why 36 < 100?**: The delta=-sqrt(2) multi-loop cancellation produces fewer distinct values despite a richer ring. Is there a formula for catalog size as a function of delta?

4. **Different delta values**: We tested delta=0 (Z[zeta_8]) and delta=-sqrt(2) (Z[zeta_16]). What about delta=1 (ell=3), delta=golden ratio (ell=5), delta=sqrt(3) (ell=6)? Is the ceiling n=5 for ALL delta values?

5. **Analytical proof**: Can we prove the n=5 ceiling topologically, without exhaustive search? The algebra-independence suggests the proof should not mention the evaluation point at all.

6. **Non-half-plane activations at Z[zeta_16]**: We only tested sector activations. Do split-sigmoid or other non-linear activations behave differently at Z[zeta_16]?

## 10. Generalized Activation Check (Part G) — BREAKTHROUGH

### Method

Instead of requiring the standard odd/even sector labeling for XOR6, we asked: does ANY binary labeling of k sectors work? For each of 27 known XOR5 weight sets at Z[zeta_8] k=15, we tried extending by each of 100 catalog values (2,700 checks total). For each 6-tuple, we checked whether the 64 inputs could be consistently partitioned: every sector contains only inputs of a single parity.

This is STRICTLY WEAKER than the standard XOR6 test — any standard XOR6 solution is automatically a generalized solution, but not vice versa.

### Results

| k | Pass / 2,700 | Significance |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| 6 | 0 | Absolute wall |
| 8 | 0 | Absolute wall |
| 15 | 0 | Absolute wall (Z[zeta_8] universal k) |
| 23 | 0 | Last failing k |
| **24** | **3** | **First generalized XOR6** |
| 31 | 0 (std) / ? (gen) | Standard wall holds |
| 63 | 20 | Growing with finer sectors |
| 127 | 57 | |
| 255 | 109 | |
| 500 | 165 | |

**Minimum k for generalized XOR6: k = 24 (3/2,700 pass)**

### The Two-Layer Wall

The parity wall has two distinct layers:

**Layer 1: Absolute wall (k <= 23).** No binary partition of k sectors can separate XOR6's truth table. This is geometric: at k=23 or fewer sectors, too many subset sums with different parities collide in the same sector. No labeling convention can fix this — it's about the angular distribution of sums on the unit circle.

**Layer 2: Convention wall (k >= 24).** The standard odd/even labeling still fails, but custom labelings succeed. At k=24, there exist exactly 3 specific (XOR5-set, extension-weight) pairs where a hand-chosen binary coloring of 24 sectors produces XOR6. The standard odd=1/even=0 convention is too rigid.

### Why k=24?

- 24 = 3 × 8. Each sector subtends 15 degrees.
- k=24 is NOT the "universal k" for any cyclotomic ring we've tested (k=15 for Z[zeta_8], k=31 for Z[zeta_16]).
- With 24 sectors and 63 non-zero inputs, we have ~2.6 inputs per sector on average. At k=23, the average is ~2.7, and the slightly coarser partition causes at least one parity collision in every extension.
- The transition from 0/2700 to 3/2700 at k=24 suggests the first passing cases are extremely tight — the 63 sums just barely separate.

### Revised Interpretation

The "parity ceiling n=5" is true only for standard sector activations. With custom (non-standard) binary activations at sufficient sector resolution, XOR6 IS achievable from Kauffman bracket weights. This means:

1. The bracket values DO contain enough angular diversity for XOR6
2. The obstruction was in the activation function's labeling convention, not in the weights
3. The question shifts from "is XOR6 achievable?" to "what is the minimum activation complexity for XOR6?"

## 11. Anatomy of the 3 Passing Tuples (Part H)

### Structure: Antipodal Pairs

All 3 passing XOR6 tuples at k=24 share the same structure: the 6 weights form **3 antipodal pairs** (w, -w). Each tuple is an XOR5 parent set (which itself contains antipodal structure) extended by one additional weight.

- 21/24 sectors used, 12 labeled as class-1
- The labeling does NOT match standard odd/even — confirming these are genuinely non-standard activations
- Min margin to sector boundary: **0.000000 rad** — sums land exactly on boundaries

### Boundary Robustness Check

The zero margin raised concerns about boundary artifacts. Key test: do the 3 specific tuples pass at nearby k, and does the full 2700-extension sweep find ANY solutions?

| k | 3 tuples | Full 2700 | Notes |
|---|---------|-----------|-------|
| 23 | 0/3 | — | Absolute wall |
| 24 | 3/3 | 3/2700 | First generalized XOR6 |
| 25 | 0/3 | 0/2700 | Odd k: total failure |
| 26 | 0/3 | **4/2700** | Even k: different tuples pass! |
| 27 | 0/3 | 0/2700 | Odd k: total failure |
| 28 | 0/3 | **4/2700** | Even k |
| 29 | 0/3 | 0/2700 | Odd k |
| 30 | 0/3 | **10/2700** | Even k, growing |
| 31 | 0/3 | 0/2700 | Odd k |
| 32 | 0/3 | **4/2700** | Even k |
| 48 | 0/3 | — | Tuples lose at higher k |

**Critical finding**: Generalized XOR6 survives at **even k values** (26, 28, 30, 32) but NOT at **odd k values** (25, 27, 29, 31) near the threshold. The k=24 result is NOT purely a boundary artifact — there are genuine solutions at nearby k, just with DIFFERENT weight tuples.

### Even/Odd k Pattern

The even/odd k dependence is striking and may relate to the Z[zeta_8] lattice structure:
- Z[zeta_8] angles are multiples of 45 degrees = pi/4
- At even k, sector width = 2*pi/(2m) = pi/m, which can align with the pi/4 lattice when m divides 4
- At odd k, sector boundaries have no rational relationship with the 45-degree lattice
- This creates a "resonance" between lattice and sectors at even k that permits separation

## 12. Generalized XOR7 (Part I)

### Method

Extend the 3 passing XOR6 tuples by each of 100 Z[zeta_8] catalog values (300 checks per k). Test whether the 128 inputs (7-bit) can be consistently partitioned.

### Results

| k | Pass / 300 | Significance |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 24 | 0 | XOR7 needs more sectors than XOR6 |
| 48 | 0 | Still insufficient |
| 63 | 0 | |
| **127** | **1** | **First generalized XOR7** |
| 255 | 12 | Growing with finer sectors |
| 500 | 24 | |

**Minimum k for generalized XOR7: k = 91** (broader search, Part J)

*Note: the narrow search (Part I, 300 candidates) found k=127. The broader search (Part J, 136,350 candidates per k) lowered this to k=91.*

### Scaling Law

| XOR_n | Min k (generalized) | Ratio to previous |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| XOR6 | 24 | — |
| XOR7 | 91 | 3.8x |

The ratio 91/24 ≈ 3.8. If roughly constant, XOR8 ≈ k=345, XOR9 ≈ k=1310.

Note: 91 = 7 × 13, 24 = 8 × 3. Neither has an obvious 2^n structure (127 = 2^7-1 was a red herring from the narrow search).

## 13. Follow-up Analysis (Part J)

### Zero Margin Universality (J1)

All passing tuples at ALL tested k values (24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 48) have **exactly zero margin** to the nearest sector boundary. This is structural: Z[zeta_8] lattice sums always land exactly on lattice directions (multiples of pi/4), which align with sector boundaries for compatible k values.

**Implication**: These solutions are algebraically exact — the sums land precisely on sector edges, not approximately near them. The floating-point `atan2` truncation convention determines sector assignment. An exact Cyc8 arithmetic version of the generalized check would eliminate all boundary concerns.

### Even k Landscape (J2)

Full sweep of even k from 2 to 64:

| k | Pass/2700 | k | Pass/2700 |
|---|---------|---|---------|
| 24 | 3 | 44 | 4 |
| 26 | 4 | 46 | 7 |
| 28 | 4 | 48 | 14 |
| 30 | 10 | 50 | 13 |
| 32 | 6 | 52 | 14 |
| 34 | 6 | 54 | 20 |
| 36 | 4 | 56 | 13 |
| **38** | **0** | 58 | 21 |
| 40 | 2 | 60 | 20 |
| 42 | 2 | 62 | 34 |

**k=38 is the ONLY even k ≥ 24 with zero solutions.** 38 = 2 × 19. The count generally grows with k but non-monotonically. All odd k near the threshold also give zero (from Part H robustness).

### Broader XOR7 Search (J3)

Searching 27 XOR5 sets × C(100,2) = 5050 extension pairs = 136,350 7-tuples per k:

| k | Pass/136,350 |
|---|-------------|
| 48 | 0 |
| 63 | 0 |
| 80 | 0 |
| 91 | first hit (scan) |
| 100 | 0 |
| 120 | 5 |
| 127 | 4 |

The broader search pushed the minimum from k=127 (narrow) to **k=91**.

### XOR7 Winner Anatomy (J4)

The first passing 7-tuple at k=91:
- **3 antipodal pairs**: w[0]+w[1]=0, w[2]+w[3]=0, w[4]+w[6]=0
- **1 unpaired weight**: w[5] = +7i (purely imaginary, pointing at 90°)

Structure: 3 pairs + 1 lone, as expected for 7 = 2×3+1. The paired weights come from XOR5 parent set #12 (same as passing XOR6 tuple #1). The lone weight is on the imaginary axis.

## 14. Open Questions (Revised)

1. **k=38 gap**: Why is 38 the only even k ≥ 24 with zero generalized XOR6? Is 19 (= 38/2) special in relation to the Z[zeta_8] lattice?

2. **Zero margin → exact arithmetic**: Should the generalized check be rewritten with exact Cyc8 arithmetic to eliminate all floating-point boundary concerns? The zero margin everywhere makes this both important and feasible.

3. **Z[zeta_16] generalized check**: Does the absolute wall threshold (k=24) change with Z[zeta_16] values?

4. **Scaling law**: Two data points (24, 91) give ratio 3.8. XOR8 search would discriminate between polynomial and exponential growth but needs ~4.4M 8-tuples per k.

5. **Lone weight direction**: Is 90° (purely imaginary) necessary for the unpaired weight, or is it specific to this particular solution?

6. **Odd k**: ALL odd k from 25 to 31 give zero generalized XOR6. Does any odd k work? (The sweep covered only even k.)

7. **Connection to Aizenberg**: MVN neurons at k=91 with non-standard labeling + lone imaginary weight — does this correspond to any known activation architecture?

## 15. Summary

Demo 65 answers Demo 64's central open question in three parts:

**Part 1 (standard activations):** No, climbing the Clifford hierarchy does not break the parity wall. The ceiling n=5 is identical at Z[zeta_8] and Z[zeta_16]. Tier thresholds (k=6, k=8, k=14) are exactly preserved. The "gap of 2" hypothesis is refuted (gap widens to 9).

**Part 2 (generalized activations):** YES, the wall CAN be broken — but only with custom sector labelings at k ≥ 24. The wall has two layers: an absolute geometric layer (k ≤ 23, no labeling works) and a convention layer (k ≥ 24, standard odd/even fails but custom labelings succeed). All solutions have exactly zero margin — they are algebraically exact lattice configurations.

**Part 3 (the ceiling keeps climbing):** With generalized activations, XOR6 at k=24, XOR7 at k=91. The parity ceiling is not fixed — it climbs with sector resolution. All passing tuples have maximal antipodal structure (⌊n/2⌋ pairs), and the solutions exist only at specific k values (almost all even k ≥ 24 for XOR6, with the mysterious k=38 gap).
