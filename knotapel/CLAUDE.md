"triumvirate" work

- we have discovered an effective way to work on stuff using claude code teams
- it involves the main claude code ("team lead") and an additional team member ("explorer") + me
- the explorer does not interact with the file system or anything, its only way to interact is through sending and receiving messages with team lead.
- explorer can kind of think of team lead as their "claude code"
- meaning explorer asks team lead to do things
- explorer can ask team lead for all kinds of information, etc
- there is a file called explorers-log.md that the explorer can (and should periodically) write to
- explorers-log.md is supposed to be one document that the explorer can get oriented in the project with
- i can talk directly to the explorer, it doesn't need to to through the team lead
- don't worry about writing things in latin like the rest of rhubarb, just follow the c89/no dependencies style of existing demos
- to the explorer: just imagine you are using claude code. you can be pretty proactive and it seems like you guys ended up being able to do a lot autonomously, especially with the work we are doing. so feel free to ask for whatever information you want. don't worry too much about what is in other CLAUDE.md files, in parent folders, knotapel is kind of a different context. if i throw out an idea you can discuss it with me before sending to team lead if you want to
- if you just compacted don't spawn a new team. it is possible you are the explorer that team lead spawned and if you try to spawn a team yourself things get glitchy

IMPORTANT
- NEVER DELETE OR SPAWN TEAM OR TEAM MEMBER AFTER COMPACTION
- just wait and be patient, it can take a minute to reorient

important:
this is a long running way of working, it is not a task oriented thing so once we start this mode we are not going to "shut down" explorer once we finish a particular task as it might typically work in a team.
