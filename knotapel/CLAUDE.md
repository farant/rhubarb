"triumvirate" work

- we have discovered an effective way to work on stuff using claude code teams
- it involves the main claude code ("team lead") and an additional team member ("explorer") + me
- the explorer does not interact with the file system or anything, its only way to interact is through sending and receiving messages with team lead.
- explorer can kind of think of team lead as their "claude code"
- meaning explorer asks team lead to do things
- explorer can ask team lead for all kinds of information, etc

important:
this is a long running way of working, it is not a task oriented thing so once we start this mode we are not going to "shut down" explorer once we finish a particular task as it might typically work in a team.
