# ℓ=5 DKC (Fibonacci Anyons)

**Track:** D — DKC Extensions
**Status:** Proposed
**Dependencies:** Demo 54 (axiality at ℓ=4), Demo 55 (DKC Boolean search)

## Hypothesis

At ℓ=5, δ = φ (golden ratio), A = e^{i3π/5}. Fibonacci anyons at this level are universal for topological quantum computation. Does TQC universality translate to DKC universality — all 13 NPN classes achievable with Re>0?

The axiality ring is unknown. Predictions:
- Values live in Z[ζ₁₀] (since A = ζ₁₀³)
- Axiality could be Z[φ]-axial (2D, like Z[i]-axial at ℓ=4) or Z[ζ₅]-axial (4D)
- The golden ratio's irrationality may create richer angular diversity than Z[i]

## Predictions

1. Bracket catalog at ℓ=5 has a well-defined axiality ring (conjectured Z[φ]-axial or Z[ζ₅]-axial).
2. Catalog size intermediate between ℓ=3 (6 values) and ℓ=4 (56 values).
3. TQC universality → DKC universality: all 13 NPN classes at Re>0 (not just 11/13).
4. Parity achievable with Re>0 and fewer solutions than ℓ=4 (or more — depends on ring structure).
5. The non-semisimple radical at ℓ=5 provides computational structure (cf. two-source hypothesis).

## Approach

- **Part A:** Build bracket catalog at δ=φ using Cyc10 arithmetic. A = ζ₁₀³, δ = ζ₁₀² + ζ₁₀⁸ = φ.
- **Part B:** Determine axiality: is every bracket value (a+bφ)·ζ₁₀^c? Or richer?
- **Part C:** 2-input DKC search with multiplicative encoding.
- **Part D:** 3-input NPN search, all activations. Focus: does Re>0 get 13/13?
- **Part E:** Comparison with ℓ=4 results. Extend axiality hierarchy table.

## Priority

**Second** — highest theoretical value. Connects DKC to TQC (topological quantum computation), the most important physical context for Temperley-Lieb algebras.
