## Paths Not Taken

- **s = 2τ conjecture (p.2, Section 5.3 p.14):** Rasmussen conjectures s(K) = 2τ(K) where τ is the Ozsváth-Szabó concordance invariant from knot Floer homology. He calls this "perhaps optimistic." The equality holds for all knots with ≤10 crossings where both are computed, and for special classes (alternating, positive, pretzel). This was later **disproved** (Hedden-Ording 2008), but the near-agreement for small knots remains unexplained. The fact that two invariants from completely different categorifications (Khovanov/TQFT vs. Heegaard Floer/symplectic) coincide so broadly then eventually diverge is a deep open question.

- **Homological width 2 → s = σ? (p.14):** "if K has homological width 2 (i.e. is H-thin in the terminology of [7]), must s(K) = σ(K)?" Open question about when the categorified invariant collapses to the classical signature. All 22 knots where s ≠ σ in the ≤11 crossing table have width 3.

- **Functoriality of cobordism maps (p.10, Section 4.2):** "We expect that the map φ_S will depend only on the isotopy class of S rel ∂S... but since we do not need this fact, we will not pursue it here." This was later proved and became structurally important for the entire cobordism framework.

- **Integer vs. rational coefficients (p.2):** "We will always work with Q coefficients. Although Khovanov's complex can be defined with coefficients in Z, Lee's theorem (Theorem 2.2) does not hold in this context." This is a fundamental restriction — the Lee deformation requires inverting 2 (the formulas involve 1/2). Over F_2 you get a different deformation (Bar-Natan's), over Z the spectral sequence doesn't converge as simply. The choice of ground ring changes the theory.

- **Bar-Natan's s vs. Rasmussen's s (p.2):** "Although we are unable to prove that the s(K) defined here is the same as that determined by Bar-Natan's conjecture, we do give a fairly general condition (at least for small knots) under which the two agree." The relationship between Bar-Natan's phenomenological observation and the spectral-sequence definition is left partially open.

- **Right-hand Reidemeister I (p.15, Remark):** "There is another version of the first Reidemeister move, corresponding to the addition of a right-hand curl. Although it is not difficult to define an appropriate map ρ'_{1'} for this move directly, for the sake of brevity we adopt the solution of [1] and [9]." The asymmetry between left and right curls (positive vs. negative crossings) is dealt with by composition rather than direct construction.

## Technical Machinery

- **Lee's TQFT deformation (pp.4-5, Section 2.3-2.4):** The foundational technique. Lee modifies Khovanov's TQFT A to A' by changing multiplication/comultiplication. Critical formulas: Khovanov has m(v_- ⊗ v_-) = 0, Lee has m'(v_- ⊗ v_-) = v_+. The basis change **a = v_- + v_+, b = v_- - v_+** diagonalizes the deformed TQFT completely: m'(a⊗a) = 2a, m'(b⊗b) = -2b, m'(a⊗b) = 0, Δ'(a) = a⊗a, Δ'(b) = b⊗b. This makes Kh'(L) trivially computable (rank 2^n). The q-grading is broken to a filtration, and the spectral sequence from this filtration is where s lives.

- **Canonical generators via orientation (p.5, Section 2.4):** Given an orientation o on L, the oriented resolution D_o has circles labeled **a** or **b** by a mod-2 nesting invariant (draw ray to infinity, count intersections mod 2). This gives a canonical state s_o ∈ Kh'(L). The bijection between orientations and generators is explicit and computable. **Key property (Corollary 2.5):** if two circles share a crossing, they have different labels. This coherence constraint is what makes the canonical generators well-behaved.

- **Mod 4 decomposition (p.7, Lemma 3.5):** Kh'(L) ≅ Kh'_o(L) ⊕ Kh'_e(L) based on q-grading mod 4. The involution ι swapping a ↔ b (via v_+ ↦ -v_+, v_- ↦ v_-) sends s_o ↦ ±s_ō. This forces the two surviving generators of a knot into different mod-4 summands, guaranteeing s_max ≠ s_min and thus s_max = s_min + 2 (Proposition 3.3).

- **Cobordism decomposition into elementary moves (pp.9-12, Section 4):** Any oriented cobordism S from L_0 to L_1 decomposes into: Reidemeister moves (don't change topology of S) + Morse moves (0-handle = circle birth, 1-handle = saddle, 2-handle = circle death). Each induces a map on CKh' with controlled filtration degree: Reidemeister moves give degree 0, 0-handles and 2-handles give degree ±1, 1-handles give degree -1. Total: φ_S is filtered of degree χ(S).

- **The slice genus bound proof (p.12, Section 4.4):** Elegant 5-line argument. If K bounds a genus-g surface in B^4, there's a cobordism of Euler characteristic -2g from K to the unknot U. Then s(φ_S(x)) ≥ s(x) - 2g, and since s_max(U) = 1, we get s(K) ≤ 2g + 1, so s(K) ≤ 2g. Apply same to mirror image → |s(K)| ≤ 2g_s(K).

- **Mirror image duality (p.8, Proposition 3.9):** s(K̄) = -s(K). Proved by showing CKh'(K̄) is isomorphic to the dual filtered complex (CKh'(K))* via the map r: v_± ↦ v*_±. The filtration on the dual reverses, giving s_max(K̄) = -s_min(K). This is structurally clean — mirror image exactly negates the invariant.

- **Connected sum additivity (pp.8-9, Proposition 3.11):** s(K_1 # K_2) = s(K_1) + s(K_2). Uses a short exact sequence for Kh'(K_1 # K_2) involving Kh'(K_1) ⊗ Kh'(K_2), with connecting maps that are filtered of degree -1. The proof traces canonical generators through the exact sequence.

- **Positive knot computation (p.14, Section 5.2):** For positive knots, s_o lives at the extreme corner (all 0-resolutions) of the cube, giving s(K) = -k + n + 1 where k = Seifert circles, n = crossings. Combined with Seifert's inequality 2g(K) ≥ n - k + 1, forces s(K) = 2g_s(K) = 2g(K). Slice genus = ordinary genus for positive knots.

- **Skein inequality (p.12, Corollary 4.3):** s(K_-) ≤ s(K_+) ≤ s(K_-) + 1 for a single crossing change from positive to negative. Each crossing change shifts s by at most 1. Proved via Livingston's result that any concordance homomorphism satisfying |s| ≤ 2g_s must satisfy this.

## Speculative Remarks

- **s = 2τ conjecture (p.2):** Already noted above. The "perhaps optimistic" qualifier suggests Rasmussen suspected it might fail but found it striking enough to state. The conjecture motivated a decade of work on comparing categorified invariants.

- **"Enlightening explanation" for Kh ↔ HF similarity (p.14, Section 5.3):** "Even if it is not true, we hope that the remarkable similarity between the two theories will have an enlightening explanation." Still partly open — there are functorial connections (spectral sequences from Kh to HF) but no deep structural explanation for why they give such similar concordance information.

- **Bar-Natan conjecture on Kh structure (p.13, Section 5.1):** The graded Poincaré polynomial P_{Kh}(K) = q^{s(K)}(q + q^{-1}) + (1 + tq^4)Q_{Kh}(K) where Q_{Kh} has all positive coefficients. This says Kh decomposes into a "thin" part (determined by s) plus a "thick" positive remainder. This structural conjecture implies the spectral sequence converges at E_2, which would mean s equals Bar-Natan's phenomenological invariant.

## DKC Overlaps

- **Cube of resolutions = state sum (pp.2-3, Section 2.1):** The Khovanov complex is built on {0,1}^k (k crossings), identical combinatorial structure to the Kauffman bracket state sum. Each vertex is a complete resolution → disjoint circles → tensor product of V = span{v_+, v_-}. The TQFT assigns to each circle a 2-dimensional vector space — exactly the same binary choice (A vs. B smoothing) as in DKC's bracket computation. The categorification replaces polynomial evaluation with chain complex, but the underlying binary state space is identical. **This means DKC's computational analysis of states (which binary strings produce which bracket values) has a direct categorified shadow.**

- **Lee's deformation as moving off a singular point (pp.4-5):** Khovanov's TQFT has m(v_- ⊗ v_-) = 0 — a vanishing condition. Lee's deformation turns this on: m'(v_- ⊗ v_-) = v_+. This breaks the q-grading (from exact symmetry to filtered). In DKC at delta=0, the bracket has extreme vanishing behavior (axiality, entanglement vanishing for non-interleaving). Lee's deformation is structurally analogous to moving delta away from 0 — you lose the degeneracy but gain a "generic" theory where everything becomes simple (rank 2^n). **The interesting invariant s lives at the boundary between singular and generic: it measures the "memory" of the singular structure that persists into the generic regime via the filtration.**

- **Writhe explicitly present in gradings (pp.3-4):** The q-grading includes n_+ - n_- = writhe. The homological grading includes n_-. The invariant s(K) is defined from the q-filtration grading of surviving generators. For positive knots (p.14), s(K) = -k + n + 1 = writhe - (Seifert circles) + 1. **Writhe is not normalized away — it's a first-class citizen in the categorified theory.** This directly supports DKC's finding that writhe carries computational information that the Jones polynomial discards.

- **Crossing changes as bounded computational steps (p.12, Corollary 4.3):** s(K_-) ≤ s(K_+) ≤ s(K_-) + 1. Each crossing change shifts s by 0 or 1. This means crossings are "units" of the invariant — each one contributes a bounded amount. In DKC, each crossing corresponds to one generator multiplication in the group, and crossing depth (number of nested crossings) drives computational capability. Both frameworks treat individual crossings as atomic units of complexity.

- **Concordance homomorphism structure (p.12, Theorem 2):** s: Conc(S³) → Z is a group homomorphism. The concordance group has connected sum as the group operation. s being additive under connected sum (Prop 3.11) and vanishing on slice knots means it descends to a well-defined homomorphism on the concordance quotient. For DKC: the bracket polynomial also has multiplicative behavior under certain compositions, and the DKC computational power is related to algebraic structure in the group. The concordance group is an abelian group measuring "how far from trivial" — s gives a linear functional on this.

- **Coherent orientation labels at crossings (p.5, Corollary 2.5):** "If two circles in the state diagram for s_o share a crossing, they have different labels." This coherence constraint means that at every crossing, the two strands meeting must carry opposite labels (a vs b). In DKC, the axiality theorem at delta=0 says interleaving is necessary for non-vanishing bracket — non-interleaving (non-crossing) braids give zero. Both phenomena say: **crossings enforce a kind of binary complementarity between the strands they connect.**

- **Degeneration at specific coefficient choices (p.2):** Lee's theory requires Q — it fails over Z or F_2. Different ground rings give different invariants (Bar-Natan's s over F_2 vs. Rasmussen's s over Q). In DKC, the root of unity (ζ_8 vs. generic) determines the algebraic behavior completely. **The choice of "where to evaluate" (which field, which root of unity) is the fundamental parameter in both frameworks.**

## Surprises

- **Gauge theory result proved combinatorially (p.2, Corollary 1):** The Milnor conjecture (slice genus of (p,q) torus knots = (p-1)(q-1)/2) was first proved by Kronheimer-Mrowka 1993 using gauge theory (instantons on 4-manifolds, Donaldson theory). Rasmussen gives a proof using nothing but Khovanov homology — a combinatorial, algebraic construction with no geometric input beyond the knot diagram itself. **A "deep" result about smooth 4-dimensional topology has a "shallow" combinatorial proof.** This is one of the most striking instances of categorification yielding results beyond its apparent scope.

- **Lee's deformation kills everything but remembers the right thing (pp.4-5):** Kh'(L) has rank 2^n — it's trivially simple. ALL the rich structure of Khovanov homology collapses. But the *filtration on the collapse* — how fast things die in the spectral sequence — encodes exactly the invariant needed to bound slice genus. The data is not in the answer but in *how you get to the answer*. This is like DKC's finding that the *bracket values* at delta=0 are structurally simple (single Z[ζ_8] axis) but the *pattern of which braids give which axis* encodes Boolean computation.

- **22 knots where s ≠ σ, and s wins half the time (p.13, table):** Among the 22 knots with ≤11 crossings where s differs from the classical signature σ, exactly 11 have |s| > |σ| (s gives a strictly better slice genus bound) and 11 have |s| < |σ|. The categorified invariant is not uniformly better — it trades accuracy differently on different knots. This is unexpected; you might expect the "deeper" invariant to always be at least as good.

- **Concordance homomorphism from purely combinatorial data:** s: Conc(S³) → Z is a surjective group homomorphism from the smooth concordance group (a huge, poorly understood object) to the integers. Getting a homomorphism to Z from diagram combinatorics alone — without any analysis, gauge theory, or symplectic geometry — was a breakthrough. The concordance group's structure is a central open problem in low-dimensional topology.

- **The a/b basis diagonalizes everything (p.5):** The basis change a = v_- + v_+, b = v_- - v_+ simultaneously diagonalizes m' AND Δ'. This is a multiplicative eigenvalue decomposition: a and b are "eigenvectors" of the TQFT with eigenvalues +2 and -2 for multiplication, and they tensor with themselves under comultiplication. This is striking — the deformed TQFT is a "classical" (diagonal, no quantum interference) theory, while the original Khovanov TQFT has non-diagonal structure (v_- ⊗ v_- → 0, which is an interference/cancellation). **The deformation de-quantizes the TQFT.**
