## Paths Not Taken

- **Direct algebraic construction of LCFTs abandoned (Section 4, p.8):** The authors note that "the general approaches which were so successful in the case of ordinary CFTs simply lead nowhere" for LCFTs, and that "despite years of efforts and many interesting partial results, very little solid information about even the simplest physically relevant LCFTs was available." The continuum (field theory) approach was essentially abandoned in favor of the lattice approach. Nobody came back to ask: can the discrete lattice structures be interpreted computationally rather than just as regularizations of a continuum theory?

- **PT-symmetric quantum mechanics connection noted but not pursued (p.3):** Bender et al.'s suggestion that quantum mechanics can be reformulated with non-Hermitian, PT-symmetric Hamiltonians is mentioned as another context where non-unitarity is natural. This connects to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that arise in LCFT. Nobody pursued the computational implications of PT-symmetric evolution in this context.

- **Dense polymer fusion not worked out explicitly in fusion section (Section 8.2, pp.31-32):** The c→0 catastrophe on the lattice is worked through for percolation (n→1, p=3) in detail, showing how the divergent invariant inv(n) gets resolved by introducing the logarithmic partner state t(n). But the analogous calculation for dense polymers (n→0, p=2) — which is DKC's operating point — is NOT done explicitly. The paper focuses on percolation as its primary example. For DKC: working out the fusion catastrophe at n=0 on the lattice would directly describe how braid composition behaves at delta=0.

- **Classification of c=0 LCFTs stated as open (p.8):** "It is not enough to build 'one' consistent LCFT at c=0 to solve the problem — there is most likely an infinity of such theories, and a lot of additional information must be provided to ensure correct identification." The landscape of LCFTs at any given c is vastly richer than for unitary CFTs. Nobody has attempted a computational classification of this landscape.

- **Blob algebra → Verma modules connection only sketched (Section 7.3, pp.26-27):** The blob algebra (TL + boundary idempotent) gives access to FULL Verma modules in the scaling limit (not just Kac quotients). This dramatically enriches the representation theory. The computational implications of having full Verma modules versus quotients are not discussed.

## Technical Machinery

- **Indecomposable tensor products at e₁+e₂=0 (Section 2.3, p.5):** For gl(1|1), when the central element E=e₁+e₂=0, tensor products of typicals produce 4-dimensional INDECOMPOSABLE modules P_n that cannot be split. The subquotient structure is ⟨n⟩→⟨n+1⟩⊕⟨n-1⟩→⟨n⟩ (diamond shape). The Casimir C maps the top ⟨n⟩ to the bottom ⟨n⟩ nontrivially, preventing diagonalization. For DKC: this is the prototype of all the indecomposable structures at special points. The condition E=0 is the algebraic analog of delta=0.

- **c=0 catastrophe mechanism (Section 3.2, pp.6-7):** At c=0, the OPE of a primary field Φ with itself has a 1/c divergence (eq.12). This FORCES the introduction of a logarithmic partner t(z). The result: L₀|t⟩ = 2|t⟩ + |T⟩ (Jordan cell), ⟨T|T⟩ = 0 (null state), and ⟨t(z)t(0)⟩ = (-2b ln z + a)/z⁴. The "b" parameter is NOT determined by conformal symmetry — it's extra data. For DKC: at delta=0, an analogous mechanism should force the Kauffman bracket to develop a "logarithmic partner" structure. The bracket value alone doesn't capture all the information; there's a hidden parameter.

- **TL non-semisimplicity at roots of unity (Section 5.4, pp.14-15):** When q = e^{iπ/p}, standard modules S_j become reducible but indecomposable. Subquotient structure (eq.38): S_j → X_j → X_{j'} where j' depends on j mod p. For p=2 (DKC's delta=0 point): all standard modules for HALF-INTEGER j are irreducible (eq.38 reduces to S_j = X_j for these). The interesting structure lives in INTEGER j modules. Key formula for irreducible dimensions (eq.39): d⁰_j = Σd_{j+np} - Σd_{j+np-1-2(j mod p)} — an alternating sum with cancellations.

- **Tilting modules as fundamental indecomposables (pp.15-16, eq.43):** Tilting modules T_j are self-dual, indecomposable gluings of two standard modules with diamond subquotient structure: X_j (top) → X_{left} and X_{right} → X_j (bottom). These are the building blocks for the spin chain decomposition. The number and structure of tilting modules is FINITE for each N (doesn't depend on q as long as q is root of unity). For DKC: the tilting modules are the "computational atoms" — the irreducible building blocks of computation at roots of unity.

- **Lattice Virasoro generators (Section 6.1, pp.18-19, eq.49):** Explicit lattice versions of Virasoro generators L_n^(N) constructed from TL generators e_k. Formula involves cosine and commutator terms weighted by Fourier modes. These lattice operators converge to true Virasoro generators as N→∞. Remarkable: this is conjectural but extensively numerically verified. For DKC: there exist DISCRETE lattice analogs of the Virasoro algebra, constructed entirely from TL generators. This means conformal symmetry is already present (approximately) in finite discrete systems.

- **Indecomposability parameter measurement on lattice (Section 7.2, pp.23-25):** The "b" parameter can be computed from finite lattices: (1) diagonalize H, find Jordan cell for T^(N), (2) normalize states, (3) construct lattice L_{-2}^(N), (4) compute b^(N) = |⟨t^(N)|L_{-2}^(N)|0^(N)⟩|²/⟨t^(N)|T^(N)⟩ (eq.54), (5) extrapolate N→∞. For percolation: b_boundary = -5/8 (exact), b_bulk = -5 (exact). Bulk value was found numerically BEFORE theoretical prediction. For DKC: this gives a concrete algorithm for measuring "how logarithmic" a system is at delta=0.

- **Lattice fusion = induction (Section 8.1, pp.29-30, eq.56):** Fusion of two TL modules defined as: M₁ ×_f M₂ = TL_{q,N₁+N₂} ⊗_{TL_{q,N₁}⊗TL_{q,N₂}} M₁⊗M₂. Geometrically: join two spin chains with an additional TL generator (Figure 8). At generic q: recovers sl(2) Clebsch-Gordan rules (eq.57). At roots of unity: produces tilting modules and indecomposable structures. For DKC: fusion IS braid composition. The formula tells you exactly what happens when you compose two braids at roots of unity.

## Speculative Remarks

- **Unbounded Jordan cell rank in bulk (Section 9, pp.33, and Conclusion p.37):** For periodic systems (bulk LCFT), the Hamiltonian L₀+L̄₀ admits Jordan cells "of arbitrarily large rank as the corresponding conformal weight is increased." The rank grows without bound. This means the logarithmic structure becomes INCREASINGLY complex at higher energies. For DKC: if this translates to the computational setting, it would mean that more complex computations (higher crossing number?) involve deeper non-diagonalizability.

- **Bulk LCFT is "of utmost interest" and largely unsolved (Conclusion, p.37):** "Among the remaining challenges, the understanding of bulk LCFTs is of utmost interest." Periodic TL algebras have "much more complicated representation theory." Conformal weights "cannot be arranged in a finite number of families" — the theory is "not rational" despite all conformal weights being rational numbers. This is an open frontier as of 2013.

- **d>2 logarithmic behavior persists (Section 10, pp.34-36):** The logarithmic/indecomposable phenomenon at special points (like Q→1 percolation) persists in d>2 dimensions. For d=2, the universal constant K = √3/π. For d>2, K "cannot be computed exactly... due to our ignorance about the scaling dimensions." The phenomenon exists but is analytically intractable. For DKC: actual knots (3D objects) should also exhibit logarithmic behavior at special algebraic points.

- **Infinity of LCFTs at c=0 (Section 4, p.8):** There is "most likely an infinity" of consistent LCFTs at c=0, and the landscape is "unbelievably complicated to say the least." Additional data beyond central charge is needed to identify a specific theory. The indecomposability parameters (b, β, etc.) are part of this additional data.

## DKC Overlaps

- **CRITICAL: Dense polymers IS DKC's operating point (pp.2,9,13,21).** Dense polymers correspond to q = e^{iπ/2} = i, loop fugacity n = q + q^{-1} = 0, central charge c = -2. In the Kauffman bracket with A = ζ₈ = e^{iπ/4}, we get A² = i, and delta = -A² - A^{-2} = -i-(-i) = 0. So n = 0 ↔ delta = 0. **DKC's entire computational framework operates at the dense polymer point.** This is the SIMPLEST root-of-unity case (p=2), the free fermion point, and the ONE case where the LCFT is analytically solvable. The fact that DKC found interesting computational structure at this point — and the paper confirms this point has rich algebraic structure — is a strong mutual validation.

- **Quantum dimension singularity = non-semisimplicity (throughout).** DKC's observation that [2]_q = 0 at ζ₈ makes representation theory "degenerate" is precisely the non-semisimplicity of TL at roots of unity. The paper's entire framework exists to deal with this degeneracy. The standard approach (quotient to get irreducibles) loses physical information; the correct approach (keep indecomposable modules) preserves it. For DKC: keeping the "raw bracket" (not quotienting to Jones polynomial) is analogous to keeping the indecomposable structure rather than forcing semisimplicity.

- **Entanglement vanishing ↔ null states (Section 3.2, pp.6-7).** DKC finds that non-interleaving braids have bracket = 0 at delta=0. The paper shows that at c=0 (= delta=0), the stress-energy tensor T is a NULL STATE: ⟨T|T⟩ = 0. Null states have zero norm — they "vanish" under the inner product while still existing as algebraic objects. For DKC: braids that give bracket=0 might be algebraic null states in the TL module sense. They're "there" algebraically but invisible to the bracket inner product. The computational content might live in their LOGARITHMIC PARTNERS.

- **Finite vs infinite group dichotomy ↔ semisimple vs non-semisimple (Section 5.4, pp.13-14).** At generic q (not root of unity): TL is semisimple, bimodule is a clean diagonal staircase, representations decompose completely. At root of unity: non-semisimple, diamonds and arrows appear, indecomposable structures. For DKC: the binary octahedral group (24 elements, finite) at ζ₈ gives a "hard capacity ceiling" because the algebra is non-semisimple with finitely many indecomposable types. At non-lattice roots, the algebra remains semisimple with infinitely many irreducibles — no ceiling.

- **Crossing depth ↔ Jordan cell rank (Section 7.1, pp.22, and Conclusion p.37).** The paper shows that tilting modules have diamond-shaped subquotient structures where the "depth" (number of arrows from top to bottom) increases with the spin j. Blob algebra tilting modules can have Jordan cells of ANY finite rank. In the bulk (periodic) case, Jordan cell rank grows without bound with conformal weight. For DKC: crossing depth (number of generator multiplications in the braid group closure) may correspond to Jordan cell rank. Deeper crossings = higher-rank Jordan cells = more computational power, but bounded by the root-of-unity structure.

- **Axiality at delta=0 ↔ free fermion solvability (Section 6.2, p.21).** DKC's axiality theorem (bracket always lies on a single Z[ζ₈] axis at delta=0) might be connected to the fact that delta=0 is the free fermion point. At q=i, the symmetry algebra is realized as U_q sl(2) at q=i, and the associated CFT (symplectic fermions, c=-2) is exactly solvable. The "axiality" might be a discrete algebraic shadow of the enhanced solvability at the free fermion point. The symplectic fermion action generates a global SU(2) symmetry (p.21) — this SU(2) might explain why the bracket values are constrained to lie on axes.

- **MVN activation ↔ fusion rules at roots of unity (Section 8, pp.28-32).** At generic q, fusion follows sl(2) rules: S_{j₁} ×_f S_{j₂} = ⊕S_j for j from |j₁-j₂| to j₁+j₂. At roots of unity, fusion produces TILTING modules — indecomposable gluings. For DKC: composing braids (MVN sectors) at delta=0 doesn't give a clean direct sum of outputs. It gives indecomposable results where different computational outputs are ENTANGLED in a non-separable way. The k-sector structure of MVN activation might correspond to the different tilting modules that appear in fusion.

## Surprises

- **DKC operates at the simplest solvable point.** Dense polymers (p=2, q=i, n=0, c=-2) is the ONE root-of-unity case where the associated LCFT is a free theory (symplectic fermions). Every other root of unity gives an interacting theory. DKC's entire computational framework — axiality, crossing depth, entanglement vanishing, NPN classification — lives at the unique point where analytic tools are maximally available. This is either a remarkable coincidence or a deep clue about why the structure is so clean.

- **The "catastrophe" is an algebraic regularization, not a breakdown.** The 1/c divergence at c=0 is NOT a sign that the theory breaks down — it's a sign that two operators MUST mix into a Jordan cell. The "catastrophe" is actually a CONSTRUCTION PRINCIPLE: whenever a divergence appears, introduce a logarithmic partner to absorb it. For DKC: the apparent "degeneracy" at delta=0 is not a limitation — it's a feature that forces additional algebraic structure (the logarithmic partners) which may carry computational content.

- **Numerical lattice results predicted theory.** The bulk b parameter (b=-5 for percolation) was measured numerically on finite lattices (N=10 to 22, Table 1, p.23) BEFORE a correct theoretical prediction existed (earlier theoretical predictions were wrong, p.25). The lattice approach isn't just a confirmation tool — it's a discovery tool. For DKC: the finite-system computations (demos with specific braid words at specific crossing counts) are potentially discovering structure that theory hasn't predicted yet.

- **The bimodule diagrams undergo a phase transition (Figures 3-5, pp.12,17,20).** At generic q (Figure 3): clean diagonal dots, one per position, no arrows. At roots of unity (Figure 4-5): complex patterns with diamonds, arrows, multiple dots sharing positions. The visual transformation is dramatic — it's like watching a crystal melt into a glass. The INFORMATION CONTENT of the root-of-unity bimodule is vastly greater than the generic case.

- **The W-algebra connection at q=i involves wall Brauer algebras (Section 7.4, p.28).** At the free fermion point (DKC's operating point), the lattice W-algebras W_{q,N} are "closely connected with known wall Brauer algebras." Brauer algebras are the algebraic framework for SO(n)/Sp(n) representation theory, distinct from the TL/SU(2) framework. This means there's ADDITIONAL algebraic structure at q=i beyond what TL captures — and it comes from a different classical group family.

- **The stress-energy tensor is a null state at c=0 (p.7).** ⟨T|T⟩ = 0. The thing that generates conformal transformations — the fundamental dynamical object of the theory — has zero norm. It exists algebraically but is invisible to the natural inner product. Its logarithmic partner t carries the actual measurable information (⟨t|t⟩ ≠ 0, ⟨T|t⟩ = b). For DKC: at delta=0, the "natural" observables (raw bracket values) might be the analogs of T — null or constrained. The deeper computational content might live in logarithmic partner objects that DKC hasn't defined yet.
