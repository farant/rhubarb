## Assessment: No extractable DKC-relevant content

This is a pedagogical introduction covering entirely standard material:
- Knot definitions, projections, Reidemeister moves (Section 2)
- Seifert circles, coherence/incoherence, Seifert diagrams (Section 3)
- Braids, closed braids, braid index (Section 4)
- Alexander's theorem proved via Vogel's algorithm (Section 5)

No paths not taken, no speculative remarks, no conjectures, no novel technical machinery. All results are textbook-level (Alexander 1923, Vogel 1990). References are Adams "The Knot Book," Prasolov-Sossinsky, and Birman-Brendle survey.

The only mildly notable items for completeness:

- **Corollary 5.7 (p.12-13):** Braid index ≤ minimum number of Seifert circles in any projection. This is a known bound but connects Seifert circle count to braid complexity — tangentially relevant to DKC's interest in crossing depth, since braid index constrains how "deep" a braid representation can be for a given number of Seifert circles.

- **Theorem 3.5 (p.5):** Any region with >2 Seifert circles on its boundary must have an incoherent pair. This is a combinatorial constraint on Seifert circle arrangements — a pigeonhole-type argument about orientation compatibility. Not directly DKC-relevant but relates to the structural constraints that limit how crossings can be arranged.

**Verdict:** Skip this paper for DKC research purposes. It contains no original results.
