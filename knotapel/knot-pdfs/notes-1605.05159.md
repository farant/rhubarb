# Paper: [Belletête, Ridout & Saint-Aubin 2017] "Restriction and Induction of Indecomposable Modules over the Temperley-Lieb Algebras"
**File:** 1605.05159.pdf (research-ingress/)
**ArXiv:** 1605.05159, published November 22, 2017

55-page comprehensive treatment of the representation theory of TL_n(β) and dilute dTL_n(β). Classifies ALL finite-dimensional indecomposable modules (Theorem 3.10), computes restriction/induction along the filtration TL_n ⊂ TL_{n+1}, gives two completeness proofs (elementary + Auslander-Reiten theory), and works out physical applications (XXZ spin chain, dimer model, twisted XXZ).

**CRITICAL DKC CONNECTION: β = 0 corresponds EXACTLY to the DKC regime.** β = q + q^{-1}, so β = 0 means q = i, hence q^4 = 1 (ℓ = 2). In the Kauffman bracket, δ = -A^2 - A^{-2}, and A = ζ_8 gives δ = 0. So every time this paper flags "except when A = TL, β = 0 and n even" — that is the DKC case.

## Paths Not Taken

- **One-boundary and two-boundary TL algebras (p.3):** "The complexity of the modules over the one-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebras and their quotients seems to go well beyond that of the indecomposable modules that will be classified in the present paper. Hopefully, the methods developed here will also be fruitful for these other families." The blob algebra (one-boundary TL) has Kac boundary conditions whose Virasoro-module identifications "remain at the level of conjecture." Explicitly open, with the expectation that boundary effects dramatically complicate things.

- **Lattice fusion as categorical operation (p.2, footnote 1):** "The fact that lattice fusion operates between modules over different algebras indicates that it should be thought of as an operation on modules over the Temperley-Lieb categories." The categorical perspective is suggested but completely undeveloped. Lattice fusion of TL_n and TL_m modules doesn't depend on n or m (for large enough n,m) — "This observation is welcome since these integers have no natural interpretation in the continuum limit." Nobody understands WHY this stabilization happens.

- **Affine TL at roots of unity (p.52-53):** For the twisted XXZ spin chain, the affine TL algebra has standard modules W_{k,z} parameterized by TWO parameters (integer k and complex z). "The identification of the M_{j,z} is presently unknown in general" at roots of unity. The Loewy diagrams in Figure 4 (p.53) show dramatically deeper structure than the regular case — full diamond lattices instead of zigzags. Explicitly open.

- **Logarithmic CFT from β = 0 (p.3):** The dimer model at β = 0 is conjectured to have continuum limit described by log CFT at central charge c = -2. "Their contention" — this remains at conjecture level. The connection between the non-semisimple TL modules classified here and log CFT modules is the bridge, but the precise dictionary is incomplete.

- **Zigzag algebra connection (p.49):** At β = 0, the TL_n AR quivers "interestingly coincide with those of a zigzag algebra discussed in [Huerfano-Khovanov]." This is noted and immediately dropped. Zigzag algebras appear in Khovanov homology and categorification of quantum groups — this creates an unexplored bridge: DKC regime → TL at β = 0 → zigzag algebras → categorification.

- **Automation of AR classification (p.44, Section 5.3):** The Auslander-Reiten approach is "purely algorithmic" — the paper sketches but does not implement a general algorithm. For DKC, automating this would give a computational tool for enumerating all indecomposable structures at any root of unity.

## Technical Machinery

- **Orbit partition of Λ_n (p.4-5, Section 2.1):** The index set Λ_n is partitioned into "critical" integers (k ≡ ℓ-1 mod ℓ, where q^{2ℓ} = 1) and non-critical orbits [k] generated by reflections through critical points. The central element F_n has eigenvalue δ_k = q^{k+1} + q^{-k-1} on standard module S_{n,k}. Modules with different F_n-eigenvalues have Hom = 0 AND Ext = 0 — they completely decouple. At ℓ = 2 (DKC regime), critical integers are all odd numbers, and orbits pair adjacent even numbers.

- **Composition factor confinement (p.5, Prop 2.2):** ALL composition factors of ANY indecomposable TL/dTL module have labels in a single orbit [k] (and same parity for dTL). This is a hard algebraic constraint: indecomposables can't mix orbits. The representation theory decomposes into independent blocks, one per orbit.

- **Ext-group table (p.14, Prop 2.18):** The complete table of Ext^1 between irreducibles, standards, and costandards. KEY: Ext(l_k, l_{k'}) ≅ C if and only if k' = k^± (immediate neighbors in the orbit). Extensions only happen between ADJACENT elements. This is the algebraic adjacency rule controlling what can be "glued" together.

- **Recursive B/T construction (pp.19-20, Section 3.1):** The families B^l_k and T^l_k are built by iterating: start with B^0_k = l_k, verify Ext(S_{k^{2j+1}}, B^{2j}_k) ≅ C, and define B^{2(j+1)}_k as the corresponding non-trivial extension. Each step adds two composition factors. The T^l_k family is the twisted dual (T^l_k = (B^l_k)^∨). These zigzag modules are the complete set of "new" indecomposables beyond the well-known standards and projectives.

- **Zigzag Loewy structure (pp.21-22, eq 3.5):** The B^l_k and T^l_k all have Loewy length 2 (only head and socle, no middle layers). The head and socle are semisimple, with composition factors alternating between even and odd positions in the orbit. The zigzag shape (eq 3.5) directly visualizes the orbit structure.

- **Projective/injective presentations (pp.23-28, Section 3.3):** Each B^l_k embeds into its injective hull J[B^l_k] with cokernel isomorphic to another B or T module (Prop 3.6). Similarly for projective covers (Prop 3.7). These presentations give the "resolution" of each indecomposable — how it sits inside the projective/injective framework. The cokernels form a recursive pattern: coker f^{2j}_k ≅ B^{2(j+1-δ_L)-δ^{2j}_R}_{k^{2δ_L-1}}.

- **Restriction formulas (pp.31-32, Props 4.2-4.3):** Restriction of B^l_{n+1,k} decomposes as: either B^l_{n,k-1} ⊕ B^l_{n,k+1} (generic case) or involves projective summands when hitting critical boundaries. The key: restriction is an exact functor, so it preserves short exact sequences. The restriction formulas are completely explicit.

- **Induction formulas (pp.34-36, Props 4.5-4.6):** For even l: B^l_{n,k}↑ ≅ B^l_{n+2,k}↓ (induction = restriction from two levels up!). For odd l: more complex, involving projective summands at critical boundaries. The critical fact: induction is only RIGHT-exact (p.9), not left-exact. The failure of left-exactness (demonstrated via eq 2.18) means induction genuinely creates new structure.

- **Tor-groups for induction (pp.33-34, Section 4.2):** The non-exactness of induction is measured by Tor-groups: Tor(A_{n+1}↓, -). These vanish when either argument is projective. The key use: Tor(A_{n+1}↓, M) ≅ Ext(M, l)* via the relation Tor(M,N) ≅ Ext(M,N*)* (eq 4.11). This converts the induction problem into an Ext computation.

- **Auslander-Reiten translation τ (pp.39-40, Section 5.1):** The AR translation τU = (Tr U)* acts on non-projective indecomposables. The τ-orbits are chains (ending at projective/injective) or cycles. For TL_n: one chain (t_0) containing P_1 and J_1, and ⌊s/2⌋ cycles (t_{2l}), (i_{2l}) each containing s modules (Lemma 5.13). The "weaving" of τ-orbits via irreducible morphisms gives the complete Auslander-Reiten quiver.

- **Reflection-deletion trick (p.46, footnote 12):** The construction of τ-orbits uses a signed action of the affine Weyl group A_1^{(1)} = Z_2 ⋉ Z on the integers with "fundamental alcove" {1,...,s}. Zigzag vertices are reflected/translated into the alcove. This is the group-theoretic mechanism that maps infinite zigzags to finite Loewy diagrams.

## Speculative Remarks

- **Boundary TL much more complex (p.3):** "The complexity of the modules over the one-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebras and their quotients seems to go well beyond that of the indecomposable modules that will be classified in the present paper." The blob algebra quotients at Kac boundary conditions appear to have indecomposables that are not captured by the B/T families.

- **Affine TL at roots of unity is open (pp.52-53):** Standard modules W_{j,z} of the affine TL algebra have unknown Loewy diagrams at roots of unity "in general." Figure 4 shows examples at ℓ = 3 with diamond-lattice structure fundamentally more complex than zigzags. The two-parameter (k,z) indexing suggests a much richer landscape.

- **Log CFT identification conjecture (p.3):** The Virasoro modules in the continuum limit of boundary TL models "were identified as certain finitely generated submodules of Feigin-Fuchs modules" — but this is conjecture-level, not proven.

- **Lattice fusion stabilization (p.2):** The fact that fusion products stabilize (don't depend on n,m for large n,m) "have no natural interpretation in the continuum limit." This stabilization is a mystery even to the authors.

## DKC Overlaps

- **β = 0 IS the quantum dimension singularity (throughout, especially pp.5-6, 15, 49, 51):** The paper's special case β = 0 is exactly q = i (q^4 = 1, ℓ = 2), which is A = ζ_8 in DKC. At β = 0: the trivial irreducible l_0 = 0 VANISHES (p.6, Prop 2.4), the standard module S_0 = 0, and the costandard C_0 is not injective. This is the MODULE-THEORETIC manifestation of DKC's "quantum dimension singularity at ζ_8 where [2]_q = 0." The quantum dimension of the trivial representation is literally zero — the module doesn't exist. The entire "trivial sector" of the theory disappears. This is not a vague analogy; it is exactly the same phenomenon viewed algebraically.

- **Non-semisimplicity = indecomposable structure = computational richness (p.4, Section 2.1; Theorem 3.10):** At roots of unity (q^{2ℓ} = 1), TL algebras become non-semisimple. Standard modules are reducible but INDECOMPOSABLE — they can't be decomposed into irreducibles. The "extra structure" of indecomposables beyond irreducibles is precisely what makes roots of unity special. In DKC terms: the non-semisimplicity at ζ_8 is WHY the bracket carries computational information. If the algebra were semisimple (generic q), everything would decompose cleanly and there would be no "hidden" structure to exploit. The finite group (binary octahedral at ζ_8) makes the algebra non-semisimple, which creates the indecomposable structure, which is the computational resource.

- **Orbit confinement ↔ sector structure (Prop 2.2, p.5):** All composition factors of an indecomposable TL module lie in a single orbit [k]. Modules in different orbits have Hom = Ext = 0. This ALGEBRAIC decoupling is the representation-theoretic version of DKC's MVN sector structure. The sectors (orbits) are the algebraically independent blocks. At ℓ = 2 (DKC regime), the orbits are maximally small (pairs of adjacent even numbers), which explains the tight capacity ceiling.

- **B^l_k depth = crossing depth (Section 3):** The indecomposable B^l_k has l+1 composition factors stretching through l consecutive orbit elements. The "length" l directly measures how deep into the orbit the module reaches. In DKC, crossing depth (more generator multiplications in the group closure) produces computationally more powerful brackets. This paper reveals the algebraic mechanism: each additional crossing depth creates a new indecomposable module (the next B^l_k or T^l_k in the recursive family), which has one more layer of non-trivial extension structure. Deeper = more layers of non-split extension = more computational content.

- **Lattice fusion = tangle composition = DKC computation (p.2):** Lattice fusion of TL modules corresponds to stacking/composing tangles. The key finding: fusion "may result in indecomposables that are neither irreducible, standard nor projective" — specifically the B^l_k and T^l_k. In DKC terms: composing tangles (which is what the Kauffman bracket evaluates) inherently produces the non-semisimple modules that carry computational information. The computation IS the fusion.

- **Parity constraint (p.5, for dTL):** Modules have a parity (even/odd) from central idempotents eid, oid. Different-parity modules have Hom = Ext = 0. This is a coarser decoupling than orbits but creates an additional selection rule. Could relate to DKC's MVN parity structure where odd/even NPN classes have different reachability.

- **Ext adjacency ↔ entanglement condition (p.14, Prop 2.18):** Extensions (non-trivial gluings) only happen between NEIGHBORS in an orbit: Ext(l_k, l_{k'}) ≅ C iff k' = k^±. This is an algebraic adjacency condition. In DKC, entanglement vanishing occurs when strands DON'T interleave — non-adjacent strands can't produce non-trivial bracket contributions. The Ext adjacency rule is the module-theoretic version: only adjacent irreducibles can form non-trivial extensions.

- **Dimer model at β = 0 = physical DKC system (pp.51-52, Appendix A.2):** The dimer model is a physical system (lattice model) whose symmetry algebra is TL at β = 0 — EXACTLY the DKC regime. Its state space decomposes into B and T modules (eq A.7-A.8). The continuum limit is log CFT at c = -2. This gives DKC a physical realization: the dimer model is a statistical-mechanical system that "computes" using the same algebraic structure DKC exploits.

- **XXZ decomposition and quantum Schur-Weyl (pp.50-51, Appendix A.1):** The XXZ spin chain Hilbert space decomposes into TL modules with multiplicities given by dimensions of U_q(sl_2) irreducibles. At roots of unity, U_q(sl_2) becomes non-semisimple, creating the indecomposable modules. "The number of times that each module appears is the dimension of an irreducible module of the quantum group U_q(sl_2), a manifestation of the so-called quantum Schur-Weyl duality." This is the physical mechanism: the quantum group controls the multiplicity, and its non-semisimplicity at roots of unity is the origin of computational richness.

- **Representation-finiteness = capacity ceiling (Theorem 3.10):** TL_n and dTL_n have FINITELY many non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. The complete list is: irreducibles l_k, projectives P_k, and the B^l_k / T^l_k families. The finiteness is a direct consequence of the orbit structure being finite at roots of unity. This algebraic finiteness IS the DKC capacity ceiling — there are only finitely many "computational states" available, which creates the hard upper bound on what can be computed.

## Surprises

- **l_0 = 0 at β = 0 — the trivial module vanishes (p.6):** Not "becomes small" or "degenerates" — it IS zero. The trivial representation of TL at β = 0 doesn't exist. This is the most dramatic possible form of quantum dimension singularity. S_0 = 0 too. The whole "vacuum sector" of the theory is gone. This should be jarring to anyone used to thinking "every algebra has a trivial representation."

- **Induction is not left-exact (p.9):** Restriction is a perfectly well-behaved exact functor, but induction (going from TL_n to TL_{n+1}) is only right-exact. The explicit counterexample (eq 2.18) shows the left-most map of an induced sequence fails to inject. Asymmetry: "going up" in system size genuinely creates new algebraic phenomena that don't exist at smaller sizes. For DKC: adding crossings (induction) is fundamentally more complex than removing them (restriction).

- **Self-duality everywhere (Props 2.11, 2.14):** Every irreducible TL/dTL module is self-dual (l_k^∨ ≅ l_k). Every projective P_k with k > k_L is self-dual. The AR quiver has a vertical bisector representing twisted duality. This pervasive self-duality severely constrains the module structure and is unusual among algebras.

- **Only Loewy length 2 for B/T (Prop 3.2):** All the "new" indecomposable modules B^l_k and T^l_k (for l ≥ 1) have Loewy length exactly 2 — just a head and socle, no middle radical layers. Despite having up to s composition factors (orbit length), they're all "flat" (width but no depth beyond 2 layers). Only the projectives P_k reach Loewy length 3. This is surprisingly simple — one might expect deeper nesting.

- **Weaving looks like braiding (Section 5.2, eq 5.13):** The process of constructing the AR quiver by interleaving τ-orbits via irreducible morphisms is called "weaving." The resulting pattern (eq 5.13) visually resembles a braid diagram: two strands (τ-orbits) crossing back and forth via irreducible morphisms. The module theory of the algebra that DESCRIBES braids has a structure that LOOKS LIKE braids. Self-reference.

- **Affine Weyl group controls the classification (p.46, footnote 12):** The "reflection-deletion trick" that constructs all τ-orbits comes from A_1^{(1)} = Z_2 ⋉ Z — the simplest infinite Coxeter group. The "fundamental alcove" {1,...,s} is where all modules live; everything outside is a reflection. The entire representation theory is controlled by this one group. A_1^{(1)} is also the root system behind sl_2, which is the Lie algebra whose quantum deformation U_q(sl_2) governs everything. Deep self-consistency.

- **Non-trivial extensions that ARE decomposable (p.29, Prop 3.9, eq 3.30):** Proposition 3.9 shows that some non-trivial extensions give REDUCIBLE (decomposable) middle terms. Example: 0 → B^7_k → B^3_k ⊕ T^4_{k^3} → l_{k^3} → 0 is non-split (the Ext is C) but the middle term B^3_k ⊕ T^4_{k^3} is a direct sum. Non-trivial extension ≠ indecomposable middle term. This is a subtlety that breaks a common intuition.

- **The degenerate P_{2,2} at TL_2, β = 0 (p.19, eq 2.49c):** The projective module P_{2,2} at the smallest possible case (n = 2, β = 0) has Loewy length only 2 instead of the usual 3. Its Loewy diagram is l_{2,2} → l_{2,2} (a single arrow from head to socle). This is the maximally degenerate case of the maximally degenerate parameter.
