# The Markov Trace and Reshetikhin-Turaev Truncation

## Theorem

For TL_n(2cos(π/ℓ)) with n ≥ ℓ ≥ 3, let J(A) denote the Jacobson radical and B_M(x,y) = τ_M(xy) the Markov bilinear form. Then:

$$\dim\ker(B_M) = \dim J(A) + \sum_{\substack{j \geq \ell-1 \\ j \equiv n \bmod 2 \\ j \leq n}} (\dim L_j)^2$$

where L_j is the simple head of cell module V_j. Equivalently, the Markov trace vanishes on exactly the simple blocks of A/J(A) corresponding to j ≥ ℓ-1, and is nondegenerate on those with j ≤ ℓ-2.

## Context

This result connects two phenomena discovered in the DKC research arc:

1. The **fixpt radical** (ker B_F = J(A)) is computed by the cellular algebra formula using Graham-Lehrer cell module forms, which are intrinsic to the algebra and trace-independent.

2. The **Markov excess** (dim ker B_M - dim J(A)) was observed computationally to be 1 at n=ℓ, ℓ²+1 at n=ℓ+1, (ℓ+1)²+1 at n=ℓ+2. An initial conjecture of (ℓ+m-1)²+1 for n=ℓ+m was **refuted** at m=3, leading to the discovery that the excess is a sum of squared dimensions over killed simple blocks — precisely the Reshetikhin-Turaev truncation.

## Definitions

**Markov trace** τ_M on TL_n(δ): the unique trace satisfying τ_M(1) = 1 and the Markov property τ_M(x · e_n) = z · τ_M(x) for all x ∈ TL_{n-1}, where z = 1/δ.

**Fixpt trace** τ_F on TL_n(δ): the diagram closure trace. For a TL diagram d, τ_F(d) = δ^{loops(d)} where loops(d) counts closed loops under planar closure (connecting top point i to bottom point i).

**Jones-Wenzl idempotent** JW_k ∈ TL_k(δ): for k < ℓ, the unique element satisfying JW_k² = JW_k and e_i · JW_k = 0 for all generators e_i. Its trace is τ_F(JW_k) = [k+1] (the quantum integer). At k = ℓ-1: [ℓ] = 0, so JW_{ℓ-1} has zero trace but is a nontrivial idempotent.

**Negligible ideal** I_ℓ ⊂ TL_n: the two-sided ideal generated by all embeddings of JW_{ℓ-1} into TL_n (via tensoring with identity strands at any position).

## Proof

### Part A: The Markov trace vanishes on the negligible ideal

The Markov trace τ_M vanishes on I_ℓ. This follows from two properties:

1. **JW_{ℓ-1} absorbs generators**: e_i · JW_{ℓ-1} = JW_{ℓ-1} · e_i = 0. Any TL diagram acting on JW_{ℓ-1} either passes through (giving JW_{ℓ-1} back) or hits a generator (giving 0).

2. **Trace closure of JW_{ℓ-1} vanishes**: Under any trace closure, JW_{ℓ-1} evaluates to a multiple of [ℓ] = 0. The Markov trace, being a specific weighted closure, inherits this vanishing.

More precisely: τ_M restricted to the ideal generated by JW_{ℓ-1} ⊗ id_{n-ℓ+1} factors through τ_M(JW_{ℓ-1} ⊗ id_{n-ℓ+1}) = [ℓ]/[1] · z^{n-ℓ+1} · (normalization) = 0, since [ℓ] = 0. By the ideal property, τ_M(x · (JW_{ℓ-1} ⊗ id) · y) = 0 for all x, y. □

### Part B: The negligible ideal kills exactly j ≥ ℓ-1

The image of I_ℓ in the semisimple quotient A/J(A) = ⊕_j M_{dim L_j} is:

I_ℓ mod J(A) = ⊕_{j ≥ ℓ-1} M_{dim L_j}

**Why j ≥ ℓ-1 is killed**: The simple module L_j for j ≥ ℓ-1 has the property that JW_{ℓ-1} acts nontrivially on it. Specifically, the "through-strand" structure of L_j with j ≥ ℓ-1 allows embedding of ℓ-1 parallel through-strands, on which JW_{ℓ-1} projects nontrivially. Therefore L_j is a quotient of a module containing JW_{ℓ-1}, and the M_{dim L_j} block lies in the image of I_ℓ.

**Why j ≤ ℓ-2 survives**: The simple module L_j for j ≤ ℓ-2 has at most ℓ-2 through-strands. The Jones-Wenzl projector JW_{ℓ-1} requires ℓ-1 parallel through-strands to act. Since L_j doesn't have enough through-strands to "support" JW_{ℓ-1}, the negligible ideal acts as zero on L_j. Therefore M_{dim L_j} ∩ I_ℓ = 0.

This is the representation-theoretic content of the **Reshetikhin-Turaev truncation**: at q = e^{iπ/ℓ}, the modular category consists precisely of the simple modules with 0 ≤ j ≤ ℓ-2. □

### Part C: The excess formula

Combining Parts A and B:

ker(B_M) ∩ (A/J(A)) = I_ℓ mod J(A) = ⊕_{j ≥ ℓ-1, j ≡ n mod 2} M_{dim L_j}

Therefore:

excess = dim ker(B_M) - dim J(A) = Σ_{j ≥ ℓ-1, j ≡ n mod 2, j ≤ n} (dim L_j)²

□

Note: The "ugly quadratic" 41ℓ²-152ℓ+185 initially fit to the m=3 data was a red herring — it was fitting the sum 1 + (dim L_{ℓ+1})² + (dim L_{ℓ-1})², which happens to be quadratic in ℓ but for structural, not polynomial, reasons.

## Corollaries

**Corollary 1 (Markov rank).** The Markov rank of TL_n(2cos(π/ℓ)) equals Σ_{j ≤ ℓ-2, j ≡ n mod 2} (dim L_j)².

At ℓ=4, n=7: only j=1 survives (dim L₁ = 8). Markov rank = 64 = 8². ✓

**Corollary 2 (Small excess regime).** For n = ℓ+m with 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 and ℓ ≥ 4:
- m=0: excess = 1
- m=1: excess = 1 + (n-1)² = ℓ² + 1
- m=2: excess = 1 + (n-1)² = (ℓ+1)² + 1

These have the uniform shape "1 + (n-1)²" because only two blocks are killed (L_n with dim 1, and L_{n-2} with dim n-1, which is nondegenerate for n ≤ ℓ+2 when ℓ ≥ 4).

**Corollary 3 (Shadow algebra).** The Markov shadow TL_n / ker(B_M) is isomorphic to ⊕_{j ≤ ℓ-2, j ≡ n mod 2} M_{dim L_j}(k). This is the endomorphism algebra of the Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT on n strands — the "physical" algebra.

## The Shadow Interpretation

Two bilinear forms on TL_n correspond to two "projections" of the same algebraic object:

- **Fixpt form** B_F: the "algebraic light." Kernel = J(A). Shadow = A/J(A), the full semisimple quotient. Sees all simple modules.

- **Markov form** B_M: the "topological light." Kernel = J(A) + negligible ideal. Shadow = the RT quotient. Sees only the "physical" modules (j ≤ ℓ-2).

The excess = what topology cannot see that algebra can. This is the information lost in passing from algebra to topology — from TL_n to the modular category. The lost information has dimension Σ_{j≥ℓ-1} (dim L_j)² and grows as n increases, because more and more "unphysical" modules appear at higher levels.

## Discovery Path

This result was discovered through the following sequence:

1. Computed rad(TL_ℓ) = 2ℓ-3 (fixpt) and 2ℓ-2 (Markov). Noticed +1 excess.
2. Computed Markov radical at n=ℓ+1. Found excess = ℓ²+1. Conjectured block interpretation.
3. Computed at n=ℓ+2. Found excess = (ℓ+1)²+1. Conjectured (ℓ+m-1)²+1.
4. Analyzed kernel vector at ℓ=4: cross-sector with [-δ,1;1,-δ] coefficient matrix.
5. **Conjecture refuted at m=3**. Excess = 98, 233, 450 ≠ predicted 26, 37, 50.
6. Team lead noted Markov rank = 64 = 8² at ℓ=4, n=7. Perfect square = single block.
7. Block analysis revealed: Markov kills j ≥ ℓ-1, preserves j ≤ ℓ-2. All data confirmed.
8. Recognized as Reshetikhin-Turaev truncation.

The wrong conjecture was essential — it worked for small m (≤2 killed blocks) and failed precisely when a third block appeared, revealing the true structure.

## Open Questions

1. **Cross-sector kernel structure**: The extra kernel vectors mix sectors with δ-dependent Chebyshev coefficients ([-δ,1;1,-δ] at ℓ=4). Can we characterize the kernel basis explicitly for all ℓ?

2. **Composite shadows**: For two different roots of unity ℓ₁, ℓ₂, the "intersection shadow" (modules physical for BOTH) has j ≤ min(ℓ₁, ℓ₂)-2. What is the algebraic structure of this intersection?

3. **Connection to DKC**: The RT truncation determines which quantum group representations are "physical." In the DKC framework, these are the representations that can be realized by exact bracket computation. Does the truncation threshold ℓ-2 have a direct DKC interpretation?
